The FBI’s decision to execute a search warrant at former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home on Monday is ""unprecedented"" – especially for a non-sitting commander-in-chief and one who has indicated he might run again, a former special-agent-in-charge told Fox News Digital on Monday.

""We just haven’t investigated presidents after they’ve served their term,"" Michael Tabman, former head of the FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office, said. ""But it is a huge move by the FBI in that the political sensitivities are clear. It's obvious that they're dealing on a very, sort of tenuous political climate when you go out and you investigate a president, especially one who says he may run for office again.""

Trump announced on Monday that his palatial Florida residence had been raided early in the morning. Sources told Fox News Digital the search was in connection with materials that Trump took with him from his time as president. Sources also said National Archives and Records Administration referred the case to the Justice Department, which recovered 15 boxes of classified materials from the home.

But Tabman, who is now retired and not involved in the FBI’s investigation into Trump, noted that securing a search warrant ""is no minor task.""

""You have to certainly, as most people know, produce probable cause … to first get prosecutors who want to write this and present it to a judge – and then present it to a judge who has to agree that you have shown probable cause that a crime has been committed, there is evidence of the crime in the location that you state and at the time you plan to execute the warrant,"" he said, by phone. ""So, there's a lot of information that you have to be very convincing of to a federal judge and they scrutinize these.""

""And there's no doubt in my mind that this went all the way to the attorney general before they took it to a judge,"" Tabman added.

Asked about the potential for a search warrant to be politicized, he said any system ""can be corrupted,"" but in an instance such as this, the search warrant affidavit will at some point be public.

After former President Trump 's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida was raided by FBI agents, Republicans are slamming the Biden administration and accusing the Department of Justice of ""political weaponization,"" while Democrats are lauding the agency for holding Trump accountable for ""wrongdoing.""

""The raid of MAL is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves,"" said Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. ""Now the Regime is getting another 87k IRS agents to wield against its adversaries? Banana Republic.""

Multiple sources tell Fox News the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago is related to the materials Trump allegedly brought to his private residence after his presidency concluded. That matter was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy issued a warning to Attorney General Merrick Garland that extensive oversight by Republicans in Congress will be heading his way.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA 'UNDER SIEGE' BY FBI AGENTS

""Attorney General Garland: preserve your documents and clear your calendar,"" wrote McCarthy.

South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem blasted Biden's FBI, calling the agency's actions ""un-American"" in a statement posted to Twitter Monday evening.

""The FBI raid on President Trump’s home is an unprecedented political weaponization of the Justice Department. They’ve been after President Trump as a candidate, as President, and now as a former President. Using the criminal justice system in this manner is un-American,"" wrote Noem.

""Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before. After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said Monday.

DOJ REPORTEDLY INVESTIGATING TRUMP'S CONDUCT, CONVERSATIONS AS PART OF 2020 ELECTION PROBE

""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System , and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections,"" the former president continued.

However, ""Squad"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said the FBI is working toward ""accountability"" and went as far as to say Trump should be in prison.

""That’s what happens when you break the law, try to steal an election, and incite a deadly insurrection. Donald Trump should be in jail. I’m glad to see the FBI taking steps towards accountability.""

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., called Trump's statement ""defensive"" during an MSNBC segment Monday.

""But look, the FBI doesn't just go in unless a judge signs off on a search warrant. That means they have some probable evidence about possible wrongdoing. And it's something that the whole country needs to pay attention to and shows that Justice Garland, Attorney General Garland is setting this up step by step,"" he stated.

""I think Attorney General Garland and the Justice Department have done a very good job by following the facts,"" he said. ""I do think that this gives me confidence that the Justice Department is really pursuing this thoroughly, objectively and in a nonpolitical way,"" Khanna continued.

Congressional Republicans also took to Twitter, criticizing the FBI's ""unprecedented"" raid.

""The only thing missing from the unprecedented FBI raid at President Trump’s home is Muammar Gaddafi’s sunglasses and cap on Joe Biden,"" wrote Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.

Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., asked on Twittter: ""What does the FBI know about Hunter Biden?""

GOP Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana mentioned the $739 billion Manchin-Schumer bill that just passed the senate, which expanded the IRS, in his rebuke of the FBI's action.

""If the FBI can raid the home of a former US President, imagine what 87,000 more IRS agents will do to you,"" he quipped on Twitter.

South Carolina Senator Tim Scott echoed Banks' sentiment on Mark Levin's radio show.

""Biden is dividing our country and the DOJ seems to be reinforcing that division through their actions… that is very dangerous to the everyday person walking on the streets of America,"" Scott said to Levin on Monday night.

""We must have 100% confidence and trust in our justice system,"" the Republican senator added. ""And if they can target a former president, you know, they could target me and you.""

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel called the raid ""outrageous.""

""Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Countless times we have examples of Democrats flouting the law and abusing power with no recourse, including Hunter Biden. Democrats continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans. This raid is outrageous,"" she wrote on Twitter.

Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority.

Legal scholars are questioning whether the FBI's raid on former President Donald Trump's Florida home over classified White House documents was necessary.

Some experts told Fox News Digital the basis for the raid, which centers on Trump's purported failure to hand over potentially classified documents to the National Archives, is unprecedented.

GOP SLAMS 'WEAPONIZATION' OF DOJ AFTER TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RAIDED BY FBI; DEMS CALL IT 'ACCOUNTABILITY'

""Based on what we now know, it was totally unjustified, even one FBI agent would have been too many,"" said Alan Dershowitz, a professor at Harvard Law School who served on Trump's legal team for the president's first impeachment case. ""The whole process was wrong and Trump was away at the time, so they can't say he was going to destroy anything.""

Legal scholars note that when individuals previously violated the law regarding classified documents, the Justice Department has opted to either not prosecute or settle for lesser charges.

""The Presidential Records Act is not commonly a subject of criminal prosecution, even in the most egregious cases,"" said Jonathan Turley, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. ""These incidents have generally been handled administratively.""

In 2004, for instance, the DOJ prosecuted former Clinton-era National Security Adviser Sandy Berger for the unauthorized removal and destruction of classified material from the National Archives. The former NSA adviser removed from the National Archives five copies of a report detailing the Clinton administration's handling of a series of unsuccessful terror attacks planned by al Qaeda for the 2000 millennium.

Berger, who removed copies of the report by stuffing them in his pants and socks, was sentenced to only two years probation and stripped of his security clearance for three years.

""These cases overall have not been subject to aggressive criminal prosecution in the past,"" said Turley.

FORMER TRUMP OFFICIAL MICHAEL CAPUTO BLASTS FBI'S MAR-A-LAGO RAID: 'FULL-BLOWN CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS'

A large group of FBI agents raided Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate Monday with search warrants. The raid was reportedly related to materials the former president brought to the residence after leaving the White House in January 2021.

The Presidential Records Act of 1978 and other federal laws bar the removal of classified documents from unauthorized locations. For months, the National Archives has sought to obtain documents pertaining to Trump's White House tenure from Mar-a-Lago.

In February, Trump handed the record-keeping agency 15 boxes of documents from the estate, including official correspondence between Trump and foreign heads of state.

""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" the former president said in a statement. Trump's representatives had informed the archives that they are continuing to search for additional Presidential records that belong to the National Archives

Some experts question the need for the raid if Trump was, as claimed, cooperating with the National Archives. They note that the National Archives would have had to refer the matter to the Justice Department.

""To get a warrant, prosecutors would need probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the search would turn up evidence or fruits of the crime at the location of the search,"" said Robert Leider, an assistant professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University.

Given Trump's status as a former head of state, Attorney General Merrick Garland likely would have to approve the search warrant. The warrant would have had to specify what crimes they believed Trump had committed.

Critics say the Justice Department needs to be transparent about its reasoning for the raid.

""This is a historic raid on the residence of a former president as well as a presumed candidate for the next presidential election,"" said Turley. ""The public needs to know the reasons for the Justice Department's decision.

Others also criticized the way in which the raid was handled. Dershowitz, in particular, noted that FBI agents likely seized documents without inquiring if they were classified, declassified, or personal to Trump.

""The Justice Department had no right to seize them indiscriminately because some may not be classified and others may be classified above their level,"" he said. ""There are things that have been declassified by the president, which the Justice Department doesn't know about.""

Since Trump had handed over documents to the National Archives in the past, experts say the federal government should have simply subpoenaed the records as required. Instead, they claim the Justice Department has now created a situation where everything seized by the FBI will have to be reviewed by both sides to ensure Trump's privacy is not invaded.

""Trump's lawyers should be in court already demanding that nobody in the government look in any of the boxes until they have an opportunity to challenge the reason for the raid,"" said Dershowitz."

Sources also said National Archives and Records Administration referred the case to the Justice Department, which recovered 15 boxes of classified materials from the home.

A source familiar told Fox News that the raid occurred early Monday morning. The source said agents brought a ""safe cracker"" and cracked a ""relatively new"" safe in Mar-a-Lago. The source told Fox News there was ""nothing in it.""

Graham also said Tuesday that the fact the raid happened just three months before a major midterm election is suspect, and said there would be massive outrage if something similar happened to a Democrat.

""We're 90 days before an election. The FBI sent agents to the home of a former president, the leading contender to be the nominee for 2024, and I want to know why,"" Graham said. ""I know doing this 90 days before an election reek of politics… Can you imagine if the roles were reversed here?""

TOP SENATE REPUBLICANS BEGIN TO WEIGH IN ON TRUMP FBI RAID, AFTER SLOWER RESPONSE THAN HOUSE COUNTERPARTS

Graham said he doesn't have a problem with the FBI ""writ large,"" but thinks it has a history of poor actions regarding Trump, particularly on its investigations into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, which has been disproved.

Some members of Senate GOP leadership have made similar comments to Graham's, demanding transparency about the search. But Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declined to comment when asked about the raid Tuesday.

High-ranking congressional Democrats, meanwhile, have generally held off from making pointed statements in the immediate wake of the raid. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., did, however, point out that there is a high evidentiary standard for law enforcement to get a search warrant.

""All I know about that is what is in the public domain. I was surprised that it flashed on my phone last evening, so I don't really have too much to say except that to have a visit like that, you need a warrant. To have a warrant, you need justification. And that says that no one is above the law, not even a president or a former president of the United States,"" Pelosi told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., attacked the GOP reaction to the Trump raid during an appearance on MSNBC Monday, saying many Republicans have ""little respect for rule of law."" However, Schumer did not address the FBI raid directly. A spokesperson for Schumer said the majority leader does not currently have further comment on the raid.

A Senate Democratic aide told Fox News Digital top Democrats in the chamber are waiting for more information to come in on the raid before making significant comments or taking major actions in response to it.

Former President Trump on Tuesday blasted the FBI raid on his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida as a political ""Witch Hunt"" that represented an assault on patriotic Americans.

""These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, was raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,"" Trump bemoaned in a statement sent out via email by Trump’s Save America political action committee.

Trump said the raid was unprecedented for a former president.

""I stood up to the Radical Left’s corruption. I restored power to the people and truly delivered for our Country like we have never seen before. The establishment hated it,"" Trump said.

The former president alleged the raid was motivated by the ""establishment’s"" efforts to stop the Republican Party and himself from succeeding in elections.

The search intensifies the monthslong investigation into how classified documents ended up in boxes of White House records located at Mar-a-Lago earlier this year. It occurs amid a separate grand jury investigation into efforts by Trump and his associates to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and adds to the legal peril for the former president as he lays the groundwork for a run in 2024.

Bob Barnes, the man who has been cycling to all 50 U.S. state capitals in one year, spotted two major landmarks while he was riding through South Dakota and North Dakota recently.

But beyond that, happy memories of his positive interactions with residents of these states and his experiences in both states have stayed with him.

Barnes, 52, of Syracuse, N.Y., reached his 43rd capital, Pierre, on May 27. He arrived at capital no. 44, Bismarck, on June 2. Amid his journey through the two states, Barnes said he experienced historic sites, a memorable meal and ""jaw-dropping"" scenery at a national park.

NY MAN CYCLING ACROSS AMERICA HITS SC, REVEALS THE ONE RELIGIOUS SYMBOL HE'S SEEN NATIONWIDE

Here are more specifics of what he saw as he neared the end of his all-American biking trip — and why these experiences stood out for him.

'Every single person is friendly'

Barnes arrived in South Dakota on May 24.

The very next day, he rode through the city of De Smet, where the Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Homes are located.

Wilder, an American author, wrote the ""Little House on the Prairie"" book series. She and her family lived in De Smet for several years.

Barnes said he had no idea Wilder's home was in De Smet until he noticed signs three blocks away.

""I was like, ‘Wow that is really cool,’"" Barnes told Fox News Digital. ""That was the real deal. That was a nice experience.""

Overall, Barnes said he loved his time in South Dakota.

""I think South Dakota was the friendliest overall state that I’ve been through,"" he said.

""Every single person is friendly. Everybody’s in a good mood, and it’s actually catching.""

Barnes said everyone he met during his time there waved at him and said hello.

""They just come up and talk to you,"" Barnes said.

""I’ve had more people come up and talk to me in South Dakota than any other state.""

""It’s awesome,"" he added. ""It’s fun … I just soak it in.""

Barnes pointed out that while he was cycling, he didn't come across many people on the road — and that, at times, he felt ""a little lonely.""

""But you just keep going,"" he said. ""You know where the next town is and you just get to it.""

Barnes said he had one of his best weeks of riding through South Dakota, reaching 433 miles in one week.

""That was really cool,"" Barnes said. ""That was a confidence booster. I know now what I have physically and I’m even more confident I’ll get [the trip] done.""

It helped that the terrain wasn’t so bad — and that drivers gave Barnes a lot of space on the road.

""South Dakota was kind of flawless,"" Barnes said about his ride.

""We did a lot of miles in South Dakota, but we got in, we got out,"" he said, referring to himself and his set of wheels. ""It was a very efficient ride through South Dakota.""

American state with ‘the best scenery'

Barnes arrived in North Dakota on May 30.

Just before reaching his 44th capital of Bismarck, on June 2, Barnes donated platelets — something he's been doing at various points along his journey as he works to raise awareness about the importance of donating blood and helping others.

""That was the first time I did my donation and visited a capital [in the same day], so that’s like a home run,"" Barnes said of his accomplishment.

Barnes said his platelet donation went well.

""They treated me like a celebrity — I get a little embarrassed when that happens,"" he added.

""They actually bought me food,"" Barnes said.

""They bought me Famous Dave’s. They bought me a brisket sandwich and that was good.""

Barnes also got to enjoy a tasty meal of chicken and dumplings at a restaurant called The Grill in Linton, North Dakota.

""It was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life,"" Barnes said.

""I’ve never had dumplings before.""

On his way out of the state, Barnes saw the Badlands, the landforms in western North Dakota.

""That was fantastic,"" Barnes said. ""That was some of the best scenery in the entire country.""

He continued, ""That was definitely a high point and a surprise. It just came out of nowhere and it was … jaw-dropping.""

Barnes even came across a herd of wild mustangs. ""They were beautiful,"" he said. ""Just so cool.""

While he was in North Dakota, Barnes went through his belongings to prepare for the final part of his trip, he said.

He threw away his two camping chairs, his dress clothes and shoes, three broken cellphones — and extra tent items like poles, covers and stakes.

He also collected all his loose change, which he said weighed about two pounds. He planned to use the change at a nearby store.

""I intently went to a convenience store and I was going to buy some scratch-off tickets and give them to the clerk just to be a nice person,"" Barnes explained.

""But they don’t sell scratch-offs in North Dakota.""

Later, Barnes left behind his trailer — which carried most of his belongings — and instead packed everything in his saddlebags attached to his bike.

Barnes said he left his trailer and hammock behind, along with a note saying the items were free for the taking.

Barnes did keep his French press, his stove, some clothes, his sandals and his solar panel, which helps him charge his phone.

Leaving his trailer behind, he said, ""made a remarkable difference.""

""I’ll never pull a trailer again,"" he said.

Next stop: Treasure State

After Bob Barnes left North Dakota on June 4, he arrived in Montana, heading for capital no. 45 on his trip: Helena.

After visiting all of the Lower 48 states, he took a ferry to Juneau, Alaska, from Canada and rode on his bicycle to the capitol — as he previously shared with Fox News Digital that he would be doing.

From there, he flew with his bike to Hawaii and rode from the airport to the capitol building to complete his trip.

The Statue of Liberty, perhaps the most celebrated symbol of American ideals and exceptionalism, reopened after the 9/11 attacks on this day in history, August 3, 2004.

The globally recognized landmark had been closed to the public for nearly three years following the destruction of the nearby World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.

Lady Liberty stood stoically watching over the horror in Lower Manhattan that day, little more than a mile across New York Harbor.

""This beacon of hope and liberty is once again open to the public, sending a reassuring message to the world that freedom is alive in New York and shining brighter than ever before,"" said then-Gov. George Pataki, as he reopened the Statue of Liberty along with Michael Bloomberg, NYC's then-mayor, plus the Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton, other officials and members of the public.

The celebration featured pomp and circumstance, including a performance of ""You're a Grand Old Flag"" and the national anthem by a military choir.

But the event also came amid concerns about terror attacks that loomed over the nation long after 9/11. New York City, nearby Newark, N.J. and Washington, D.C., all faced terror threats in the days before the reopening ceremony.

""I think it shows the world that liberty cannot be intimidated,"" Craig Manson, assistant interior secretary, said before the festivities.

""I think it's significant that despite the raising of the alert levels, we are still going ahead with the reopening.""

STATUE OF LIBERTY'S ‘LITTLE SISTER’ ARRIVES IN UNITED STATES FROM FRANCE IN TIME FOR FOURTH OF JULY

The Statue of Liberty, a gift from the people of France, opened to the public in 1886. French sculptor Frederic Bartholdi conceived of it; he visited the United States in 1871 after serving his nation in the Franco-Prussian War.

Lady Liberty's interior metal framework was fabricated by Gustave Eiffel, who immediately afterward began building the iconic tower in Paris that bears his name.

The Statue of Liberty has been shuttered for various reasons through its history.

It was closed for two years from 1984 to 1986 for extensive restoration work before its centennial celebration.

The scaffolding around the Statue of Liberty became a pop-culture symbol of the 1980s that appeared in everything from movies to music videos.

The Statue of Liberty closed again to the public for four months at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, before a phased period of reopening began in July.

Visitors could access the statue's famous torch for the first 30 years of its existence.

But public access to the torch was ended following the deadly ""Black Tom explosion"" of July 30, 1916.

The Statue of Liberty's torch was among the structures damaged by explosion fragments.

As the U.S. contemplated entry into World War I, German spies sabotaged a barge in New York Harbor filled with an estimated 2 million pounds of arms and munitions destined for Allies in Europe. The horrific explosion could be felt as far away as Philadelphia.

Talk about crushing the competition.

Lat 35 Racing's first all-female rowing team took on the biennial Great Pacific Race, challenging rowers to cross 2,400 nautical miles of Pacific Ocean from San Francisco, Calif., to Waikiki, Hawaii, as fast as possible.

The Lat 35 ladies — Libby Costello, Sophia Denison-Johnston, Brooke Downes and Adrienne Smith — crushed the competition.

They also set a global best for female contenders.

BREACHING WHALE JUMPS OUT OF OCEAN AND LANDS ON TOP OF A MASSACHUSETTS FISHING BOAT

The women finished the race in 34 days, 14 hours and 11 minutes, breaking the previous record by 24 hours.

Lat 35 partnered with the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) to raise money and awareness for mental health throughout the journey.

The team surpassed its goal of $10,000 — raising $12,083 for the cause as of current.

Teammate Brooke Downes shared the experience in an interview with Fox News Digital, repeating the team’s mission statement which was to ""get to Hawaii as fast as possible.""

SHARK QUIZ! HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW YOUR SHARKS THIS SUMMER?

""So that’s what we did,"" she said.

The rower revealed how breaking the record was, at times, questionable.

She admitted that her confidence in expecting to break the record might have been ""naïve,"" given that conditions on the water were so unpredictable.

""The last couple of days we had really terrible conditions and our expected time of arrival just kept getting pushed back later and later,"" she said.

The team left San Francisco on June 21 — and arrived in Waikiki on Monday, July 25.

""But the last day, we knew that we were going to break a world record. It just came down to a matter of by how much.""

The team left San Francisco on June 21 — and arrived in Waikiki on Monday, July 25.

Besides hitting rocky waters at the tail end of the voyage, Downes remembered moving ""terribly slow"" about two weeks into the race due to the wind conditions.

This slow movement lasted for about five days in intense heat.

""That was kind of a point where, for me, I saw the opportunity to break the overall record kind of go away, which was just really disappointing,"" she said.

""Seeing how defeated our whole team was — was just pretty heartbreaking.""

But the strength of the foursome kept the boat moving along as the women lifted each other up and laughed through the challenging tides.

prev Image 2 of 2

""Out there in the middle of the ocean, we had so much fun,"" she said.

""More fun than I could have ever expected to have.""

""There was one day that the conditions were perfect for us to jump in the water and swim,"" she added.

""That was a really special day for us to all be together, swimming in this spot off land [where] probably no other human has ever been.""

HOW TO EXERCISE DURING A WORK TRIP AND STAY FIT WHILE TRAVELING

Downes expressed feeling ""grateful"" for her teammates’ support on nights when conditions were rough and sometimes outright painful physically.

Each teammate rowed for two hours on and two hours off to balance adequate sleep — and to allow the team members to manage other tasks, such as preparing freeze-dried meals and handling boat maintenance.

The crew made 25 liters of purified water per day, through a pressurized system and solar energy — which they used to drink, cook, rinse off and clean their clothes.

""Every single day brings something new,"" she said.

""But the schedule is exactly the same the entire time.""

Each woman only brought along enough clothes to satisfy every weather condition, including rain, intense heat and even cold weather.

The cabins on the front and back ends of the boat slept two rowers each, which was a tight squeeze for Downes, who measures 5’11"" in height.

""It’s pretty amazing how much you can fit in the boat,"" she said. ""But you didn't bring anything that you didn't need.""

Downes detailed how each woman only brought enough clothes to satisfy every weather condition, including rain, intense heat and even cold weather.

""The beginning was very cold,"" she said.

""And extra-cold because we would have to put on the same wet clothes to row.""

The women encountered other obstacles on the water, such as being hit by flying fish. Also, the boat’s rudder was knocked out of place by an unidentified marine animal — sending the boat spinning.

The boat’s bearings also began to corrode halfway through the journey. That was caused by different metals being mixed into the wheels.

""We made it to the finish line with no spare wheels,"" she said.

It took about a day and a half after the women first spotted Hawaii’s mountainous landscape to officially reach land.

New Jersey-born Downes, who graduated from the University of Southern California in 2019, described the journey as ""the best decision"" she’s ever made as a rower of more than 10 years.

""I was really curious,"" she said.

""I wanted to know what it was like to be out in the middle of the ocean with nobody around … during this huge, incredible race.""

""I love rowing, and I want to row even more now.""

The rower said there was ""nothing stopping"" her except fear, so teammate Libby Costello — a longtime friend of Downes — invited her to join the Lat 35 crew.

Downes accepted the offer, quit her job and moved to Santa Barbara to begin training.

REMOTE WORK IS CHANGING TRAVEL — HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

""I thought, I can either watch that whole experience and wish that I was doing it with her — or I can actually do it with her,"" she said.

""And it was the best decision I’ve made.""

Downes, who was training for the National Rowing Team prior to the race, is aspiring to qualify for the Olympics in 2024, but said she’ll be taking some time to recuperate first.

""I love rowing, and I want to row even more now,"" she said.

Denison-Johnston is also an Olympic hopeful.

Downes is currently enjoying her time in Hawaii.

The record for fastest male rowers was also broken by a Lat 35 team during the 2021 race.

The men completed the race in 30 days, five hours and 37 minutes.

Double Dubs – Laramie, Wyo.

Double Dubs earned national acclaim last year when it won first-place honors in the ""extra hot"" sauce category at the National Buffalo Wing Festival.

With a fleet of five Wyoming food trucks, Double Dubs founder Trent Weitzel has big ambitions.

He announced on Friday, in honor of National Chicken Wing Day, that he will attempt to set a Guinness World Record next July by selling 55,000 wings in a single day at Cheyenne Frontier Days.

The current record holder is the Village Casino of Jamestown, N.Y., which sold 40,210 wings in 24 hours.

Alabama is one of 15 states that do not ask voters to register with a political party ahead of a voting in a primary. Some Republicans argue it’s time to change that.

The Alabama Republican Party will take a vote this weekend on whether to support a party registration requirement for primaries, also known as having a closed primary. Passage of the resolution would signal support for the idea, but the Alabama Legislature would have to enact legislation to make such a change.

""I very much expect it to pass,"" Alabama Republican Party Chairman John Wahl said of the party resolution. The state GOP approved a similar resolution in 2016.

Currently, voters casting ballots in a primary election in Alabama simply tell a poll worker which ballot they want. Wahl said there is growing concern about possible cross-over voting. Republicans should be electing Republican nominees, he said.

ALABAMA VOTED NO. 1 IN COACHES' PRESEASON POLL

""I think this is an issue that has been highlighted by this election cycle. We’ve seen so much frustration from candidates, voters, as well as the members of the Republican Party, towards Democrats purposely trying to affect the outcome of our Republican primaries,"" Wahl said.

Wahl said the resolution endorses the idea of a closed primary, but doesn't recommend any specific method. States have different rules regarding primary voting and party registration.

Only nine states have completely closed primaries where a voter seeking to vote in a closed primary must first be a registered party member, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Other states have partially open or partially closed primaries, where unaffiliated voters may be able to vote in a primary or where voters can change their party affiliation on primary day.

Sources told Fox News Digital the search was in connection with materials that Trump took with him from his time as president. Sources also said National Archives and Records Administration referred the case to the Justice Department, which recovered 15 boxes of classified materials from the home.

FIRST ON FOX: Veteran political strategists James Carville and Ed Rollins aren't quite seeing eye to eye on the political impact the FBI's raid on former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home could have on the midterm elections.

Speaking with Fox News Digital Tuesday, Carville, who was an adviser to former President Bill Clinton, said there wasn't enough information about the raid to know just yet what it could mean for voters heading to the polls.

But Rollins, a Republican, predicted the event could end up being the ""biggest issue in the midterms.""

""The attorney general and the FBI need to explain to the American public what they were doing and why,"" Rollins, an adviser to former President Ronald Reagan, said when asked about the raid.

ERIC TRUMP GIVES CLEAREST INDICATION YET OF POSSIBLE TRUMP 2024 RUN FOLLOWING FBI RAID

""This is an invasion of a man's home … and the public has a right to know why.""

He added that Trump had a right to know if he was being suspected of committing a crime and that it was his right to defend himself.

""To argue they are gathering evidence is not good enough. Trump not only is a former president, but certainly is the front-runner for a future nomination and possible re-election,"" Rollins said.

""This could become the biggest issue in the midterms, and the ruthless abuse of power could overcome all else. It has already stepped on all other news that Biden and his team wanted to promote on his legislative record,"" Rollins added.

He was referring to the passage of a number of Democrat-backed legislative priorities being overshadowed by news of the raid.

Carville took a different tone, appearing more hesitant to say the Mar-a-Lago raid would play a central role either way in upcoming elections.

He did, however, warn ""right-wing"" media personalities and commentators to ""tread very carefully"" in criticizing the raid, arguing that the documents and data the FBI had to justify the raid were likely ""substantial.""

When asked how he thought it might affect voters' decisions as they head to the polls in November, Carville said, ""We don't know because we have to find out more facts.""

Carville then argued that if Trump's claims that the raid was political were true, then he should make the search warrant public.

""I can't imagine that that search warrant said anything less than something just overwhelming. And if it's not, then Trump can make it public,"" he said.

Trump’s private residence in Palm Beach, Florida, was raided by the FBI Monday morning, when the former president was in New York City. The raid was connected to an investigation into classified records Trump allegedly took with him from the White House to his home when he left office in January 2021.

When asked whether Biden or any White House officials were aware of the raid or had been briefed, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said they were not.

Trump made the raid public Monday evening, saying in a lengthy statement that ""nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.""

""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said. ""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections.""

""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before,"" Trump said.

House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., threatened to probe the DOJ over the raid if the GOP takes majority control in the fall while House Republican Study Committee Chair Jim Banks, R-Ind., said the action was ""un-American.""

In May 2019, California Democratic Rep.

""While Trump stonewalls the public from learning the truth about his obstruction of justice, Trump and Barr conspire to weaponize law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies,"" Schiff wrote in a tweet at the time.

Similarly, two years later, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., accused Barr of acting as Trump's ""personal henchman"" following a report that claimed the DOJ secretly subpoenaed records for two Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.

""This is an EXTREME and dangerous abuse of power,"" Jayapal wrote. ""It is wholly unacceptable to weaponize the DOJ against members of Congress. Bill Barr consistently acted as Trump's personal henchman, and he must be held fully accountable for his actions.""

Earlier this year, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., one of seven Democrats serving on the nine-member January 6 committee panel, said Trump tried to ""weaponize"" the DOJ in an attempt ""to retain power.""

Despite the Trump-era accusations made by the House Democrats, the party, overall, is now silent or lauding the Justice Department after Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida was raided by FBI agents on Monday.

Pelosi said Tuesday she believed the FBI must have ""justification"" for the raid.

""All I know about that is what is in the public domain. I was surprised that it flashed on my phone last evening, so I don't really have too much to say except that to have a visit like that, you need a warrant. To have a warrant, you need justification. And that says that no one is above the law, not even a president or a former president of the United States,"" Pelosi told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

Raskin, during an appearance on MSNBC, also responded briefly to the raid at Mar-a-Lago, insisting that Americans have an ""interest"" in the rule of law.

""The great thing about the separation of powers is we knew nothing about that,"" Raskin said. ""We don't know whether that's something related to what we're working on or not...""

""Everybody in America, and speaking as a citizen, we all have an interest in the rule of law in the country and respect for the rule of law, and resistance to the lawlessness that seems to be always out there,"" he added.

In a tweet issued Monday after the raid was made public, Jayapal sang a different tune as she claimed the FBI is taking steps toward ""accountability"" and suggested that Trump should be in prison.

""That’s what happens when you break the law, try to steal an election, and incite a deadly insurrection,"" she wrote. ""Donald Trump should be in jail. I’m glad to see the FBI taking steps towards accountability.""

Multiple sources tell Fox News the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago is related to the materials Trump allegedly brought to his private residence after his presidency concluded. That matter was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority.

Rep.

Bishop joined other GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee in demanding U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray urgently testify regarding the Trump raid.

In a follow-up tweet on Tuesday, Bishop noted that jury selection has begun in the re-trial of two of the four men charged in federal court in connection to an alleged kidnapping plot targeting Whitmer in October 2020 allegedly over disgust with the Democrat’s lockdown restrictions.

TRUMP FBI RAID: HILLARY CLINTON APPEARS TO FUNDRAISE OFF MAR-A-LAGO SEARCH

In April, a federal jury could not reach a verdict for Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr., but two other co-defendants, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta, were found not guilty and acquitted on all charges.

Defense attorneys had accused the FBI of entrapment, painting their clients of marijuana-smoking weekend warriors, rather than domestic extremists weeded out by an FBI informant.

""As the retrial begins for 2 of the accused in the FBI Whitmer plot, remember: Arrests were announced on Oct. 8th, 2020, during early voting. A perfect October surprise,"" Bishop tweeted Tuesday. ""If you're still inclined to give the FBI the benefit of the doubt here, think again.""

Bishop shared a link to a story by The Wall Street Journal outlining how the two acquitted men in the alleged Whitmer kidnapping plot could pose an uphill battle for prosecutors during the retrial, noting how a former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan admitted that the ""big question is, did the FBI arrest these defendants too quickly, before they gathered enough evidence.""

Bishop wrote about the case in a recent op-ed for North State Journal. The congressman pointed out how during a recent hearing hosted by the House Judiciary Committee, he questioned Matthew Olsen, assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice’s National Security Division.

""I questioned Mr. Olsen about a disturbing trend emerging in the DOJ’s efforts to detect and thwart domestic terrorism plots. Specifically, weeks before the 2020 election, the FBI announced it had foiled an alleged plot to kidnap the Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer. Two years later, the story is quite different,"" Bishop said, noting how two of the men charged were acquitted on grounds of entrapment and the jury was hung on the two others.

""It is clear from the current evidence that federal agents cooked up this operation, trained recruits to carry out the FBI’s plan, directed recruitment efforts, and incentivized the informants with handsome paydays in order to keep the plot moving forward – all on the taxpayers’ dime,"" Bishop wrote.

Vermont voters will choose candidates Tuesday to fill a seat in the U.S. Senate that has been occupied since 1975 by retiring Democratic U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the last of Congress's so-called Watergate babies, elected after the resignation of former President Richard Nixon.

The leading Democratic candidate to run for Leahy's seat in the November election is U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, a liberal Democrat known for working across the aisle. Welch has held his House seat since 2007. During the years he has been in Congress, Welch has been one of Vermont's top vote getters and would be an odds-on favorite to win the general election.

Vermont's former U.S. Attorney Christina Nolan and retired U.S. Army officer Gerald Malloy are the two leading candidates vying for the Republican Party nomination for the November election.

Both Nolan and Malloy believe they can win the seat. Vermont is considered by many to be one of the most liberal states in country. No Republican has represented the state in Washington since 2001 when the late Sen. Jim Jeffords left the GOP to become an independent, switching control of the Senate from Republican to Democratic.

But the state, with its small congressional delegation, has never sent a woman or a member of a minority group to represent it in Washington.

Welch’s decision to run for the Senate seat opens up his seat in the House, the first time since 2006 that there have been any openings in Vermont’s three-member congressional delegation. The two leading Democratic candidates are Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and state Senate President Pro Tempore, Becca Balint.

In deep blue Vermont it’s likely the winner of the Democratic House primary will win easily in November, erasing what some consider to be the blot on the liberal state’s reputation of only being represented by white men.

The two share similar policy views, but the race is pitting Gray, a centrist candidate supported by the state's Democratic establishment, and Balint, who is being supported by the progressive wing of the party in Vermont and nationally.

The two leading GOP candidates for the U.S. House nomination are Ericka Redic, of Burlington, and Liam Madden, a Marine Corps veteran from Bellows Falls.

Redic says that if elected she would focus on fighting inflation, illegal immigration, drug misuse and government overreach, particularly as it concerns vaccine mandates.

Madden, a non-traditional candidate in the Republican primary, says he's an independent. He said he had thought of declining the nomination if he wins, until he learned that would allow the party to choose a replacement for the November ballot.

The Vermont primary will also choose the nominees for governor.

Vermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott, of Berlin — a one-time stock car driver and the GOP's lone statewide officeholder — is seeking his party's nomination to run for reelection in November.

Elected to his first two-year term as governor in 2016, Scott has focused his time in office on making Vermont more affordable and working to attract more people to the state to counter a demographic trend of an aging population with a shrinking workforce and fewer school-age children.

He is facing two little-known candidates in the primary.

There is simply no question, by any objective standard, that Joe Biden is on a hot streak.

After many months of muddled messaging and plummeting polls, the president has pushed through a raft of important legislation, culminating with a sweeping climate change/health care/corporate taxes measure that will win final approval this week. Some of the bills passed with strong bipartisan support. And it’s been just over a week since the president announced that on his orders, a drone strike had killed the leader of al Qaeda.

But all this may have little impact on Biden’s attempt to rally his party behind him in seeking a second term. The media narrative against him – that he’s too old, too slow, and that most Democrats want a younger candidate – could be too powerful to alter, baked into the midterm cake.

That may be unfair to Biden, who now has a stronger slate of legislative accomplishments than any president in decades, but life is unfair. He would be 82 at the next inauguration and too many of his voters – along with Democratic lawmakers – seem ready to give him a gold watch and a hearty sendoff.

BEHIND THE KANSAS ABORTION SHOCKER : WHY SOME RED STATES DON'T WANT A TOTAL BAN

Imagine a football team that goes 2-7, with growing calls to fire the coach, and then wins its last 7 games to pull out a winning record. Does the strong finish erase the memory of its earlier awfulness?

Keep in mind that journalists worship polls. If Biden were suddenly to get a healthy bump, the media would start doing pieces about his comeback, easing fears among fellow Democrats that he will drag his party down in 2022 and be a weak candidate two years later. But without that short-term pop, the conventional wisdom remains that inflation (though Biden has brought down gas prices somewhat) will drive a sweeping Republican victory in November.

And then there’s the nature of the climate legislation itself, the dubiously named Inflation Reduction Act. Even Bernie Sanders says it will have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation.

The truth is it will take a while for ordinary folks to feel the effects of the $700-billion bill, and elections are won or lost in the short term.

The measure provides the greatest investment in climate change by a single country, but global warming won’t ease for years, and even the clean-energy funds will have to be awarded and workers hired before anyone’s life is improved.

As the Washington Post points out, the $7,500 credits for buying electric cars only happen if manufacturers displace Chinese batteries by 2024.

Allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices is a long-sought goal, but that will also take some time. The $300 billion in deficit reduction is an important step, but for most Americans the deficit is an abstraction.

Meanwhile, some liberal Democrats can barely hide their dissatisfaction with Biden. In the case of two veteran House members running against each other in a New York district, Jerry Nadler said it’s too early to talk about 2024 and Carolyn Maloney said she doesn’t think Biden’s running (and then apologized by saying she’ll back him if he does but still doesn’t think he will). That is hardly the mark of a strong incumbent.

Rather than trying to hector him out of the race, Maureen Dowd used her New York Times column to appeal to Biden’s sense of history: ""He could leave on a high, knowing that he has delivered on his promises for progress and restored decency to the White House.""

Biden wasted months fighting for on a left-wing fantasy bill whose absurd price tag – $3.5 trillion – meant it would never come close to passing a 50-50 Senate. And while Republicans spent many hours trashing the new bill that they can’t stop because of reconciliation – just as Democrats did with the Trump tax cuts – it’s a far more moderate measure than would spend less than a quarter of the original measure.

Maybe this gives Biden a more solid platform to sell himself as worthy of four more years. But for now there’s a profound disconnect between Biden and his voters on whether the man who first ran for president in 1987 should make one last run."

What happened in Kansas is what the Supreme Court, and defenders of its abortion ruling, say they wanted.

Not the outcome, to be sure: A stunning surge of voters who supported keeping the right to abortion in the state constitution, just a point below the level considered a landslide victory.

But the whole rationale for overturning Roe v. Wade was to take such decisions out of the hands of unelected judges and put them closer to the people, on a state by state basis. Well, in Kansas, a conservative state where Republicans far outnumber Democrats, the people have spoken, with a 59 to 41% declaration.

Now those who are passionately pro-life will keep on fighting, as they have every right to do, just as pro-choicers wouldn’t have given up if they had gotten beaten. This is just one round in the Kansas battle.

HOW POWERHOUSE PERSONALITTIES DRIVE EVERYONE CRAZY - AND OFTEN CHANGE HISTORY

But it serves as a national warning that complete bans on abortion, while inevitable in some red states, are not so easily accomplished. And many Republican lawmakers must have woken up yesterday and wondered whether they need to compromise.

It’s no coincidence that some conservative Republican governors haven’t seized this moment to make abortion totally illegal in their states. Ron DeSantis, who obviously has 2024 ambitions, is sticking with his past position of no abortions after 15 weeks – which might have seemed dramatic a few months ago but is now a middle ground, perhaps better suited to Florida and a White House campaign.

What is fueling the abortion rights side, in my view, is extensive media coverage of the lack of exceptions proposed in some state bans. The Idaho GOP has endorsed the idea of not allowing abortions even if the mother’s life is in danger. And stories about women with serious miscarriages being allowed to bleed for days because the treatment is the same as an abortion haven’t exactly projected an image of compassion.

The rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl who went to Indiana for an abortion, once it was confirmed, provides a graphic case for those who say it is cruel and heartless to force victims to give birth to their rapist’s babies.

Tudor Dixon, who won the GOP nomination for Michigan governor on Tuesday, described a hypothetical 14-year-old girl who is sexually assaulted by her uncle as a ""perfect example"" of someone who should be forced to give birth. Asked if she wanted to soften her remarks, Dixon said, ""I’m not hiding from it.""

These legal battles will play out in all 50 states, and now the Justice Department has joined the fray. DOJ sued over the new Idaho law, saying it violates a federal requirement (for hospitals accepting Medicare) that medical care must be provided when a pregnant woman’s life or health is at stake. Merrick Garland said ""we will use every tool at our disposal"" to ensure such treatment.

President Biden signed an executive order yesterday aiming to protect women who travel out of state for abortions, but its weak language only directs HHS to ""consider"" such action. The travel question is certain to be another front in this legal war.

In Kansas, advocacy groups poured millions into advertising campaigns, with the Catholic Church and other religious groups weighing in on one side and national abortion rights groups on the other.

Turns out the pro-choice side won counties where Donald Trump won big victories last time, making clear there were plenty of Republicans who at least favored allowing abortions with some restrictions.

But that will be up to state legislators, who can still impose a total or near-total ban on abortions.

It was, no question, a victory for America and the world.

The drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahri, the leader of al Qaeda, took out one of the world’s most despicable terrorists, the intellectual force behind the group who, as Usama bin Laden’s number two, helped mastermind the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. And Zawahri pulled off devastating attacks before that, including the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, which prompted the Clinton administration to target him.

It was also a big win for President Biden, and yet no one felt more of a sense of closure than the families of the 9/11 victims. Zawahri was a central plotter for the hijacked airplanes that toppled the World Trade Center, slammed into the Pentagon, and would have struck a third target if not for the bravery of passengers above Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

That utterly transformed our politics for years, plunging us into an age of not bringing liquids on airplanes, passing homeland security laws and waging a 20-year war in Afghanistan.

HOW POWERHOUSE PERSONALITTIES DRIVE EVERYONE CRAZY - AND OFTEN CHANGE HISTORY

This was not a military operation of the kind that killed Usama bin Laden in 2011, with Biden sitting in the famous Situation Room photo as he, President Obama and other leaders waited for the results of the Navy SEAL raid. While officials aren’t saying this publicly, it was a CIA counterterrorism operation. It took another 11 years for Biden to authorize the strike that killed Zawahri on Saturday.

Zawahri’s gray-bearded visage had become familiar to Americans when he took over al Qaeda and made a series of videos to deliver terror messages. It’s true he was past his prime, but this was about accountability.

TRUMP AGAIN DOMINATING THE NEWS, BIDEN'S BLISTERING SPEECH A SIDEBAR

From a White House balcony, where he is still sidelined by COVID-19, Biden told the country: ""Justice has been delivered, and this terrorist leader is no more… We make it clear again tonight that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out.""

Biden deserves credit for the tough call, as some Republicans acknowledged, but this is not going to transform the midterms. It will soon fade from the news with voters remaining focused on inflation, COVID-19 and other domestic issues. Even Obama only got a short-term bump for taking out bin Laden.

Now we come to a more complicated question.

Biden has a strong argument that his approach has been vindicated after he presided over the worst foreign policy debacle in generations, the violent and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. The president said then that the U.S. could conduct counterterrorism missions even without boots on the ground – and the CIA operation proved him right, with reports of no civilian casualties.

But Republicans are taking some shots over the fact that Zawarhi was in Kabul at all. Under the withdrawal deal – negotiated by Donald Trump in 2020, and later accepted by Biden – the Taliban pledged not to harbor any terror organization with international aims.

Is anyone really shocked that the Taliban, which claim to have had no idea of Zawarhi’s presence, are lying? He lived in a luxurious home in a wealthy gated community in the capital, not far from the U.S. Embassy. He returned after the Taliban takeover, let down his guard, and it took our intelligence service months to confirm his presence and his practice of spending time on his balcony, the spot where he was killed – after his family moved to another Kabul home.

Can anyone really doubt that the Taliban regime, which has also flouted its promises on human rights, is shielding other al Qaeda terrorists as well?

Media commentators ranging from Donald Trump's strongest foes to most fervent allies appeared in agreement on one thing Monday: the FBI raid of his Mar-a-Lago home may have handed him the 2024 Republican nomination.

The FBI executed a search warrant of the former president's Florida residence on Monday, stunning the news industry and incensing Trump and his supporters. Sources told Fox News Digital the search was in connection with materials that Trump took with him from his time as president. Sources also said National Archives and Records Administration referred the case to the Justice Department, which recovered 15 boxes of classified materials from the home.

CNN commentator Alyssa Farah Griffin, who served as Trump's White House communications director but is now one of his fiercest critics, fretted on ""New Day"" that an empty-handed raid could send Trump to the White House.

""This, I'm hoping, goes beyond simply not complying with some archiving laws, or [the Department of Justice] just handed Donald Trump the Republican [nomination] and potentially the presidency,"" she said. ""If it's seen as some sort of massive overreach and not something incredibly serious, this is a very good day for Donald Trump.""

NANCY PELOSI REACTS TO FBI RAID ON TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RESORT, SAYS AUTHORITIES HAD 'JUSTIFICATION'

Joe Walsh, the ex-GOP congressman who like Farah Griffin evolved from a passionate Trump fan to one of his sharpest media foes, also expressed concern the search of the former president's home may rally his supporters behind the flag.

""Both things are true: 1. The Justice Department’s job is to pursue justice & uphold the rule of law. And they should NEVER let politics get in the way of that. Yesterday, they did their job. 2. What happened yesterday handed the 2024 GOP nomination to Donald Trump,"" he tweeted.

Trump has essentially frozen the 2024 GOP field as he gives hints that he will make a third run for the White House without formally announcing yet. His dramatic statement about the raid said his home had been ""occupied,"" ""raided,"" and was ""under siege"" by the FBI, and it received a strong reaction from his backers.

CNN's Dana Bash said Trump had greatly advanced his short-term political goal of capturing the nomination, saying his language in the statement about the raid was ""kind of genius.""

""It totally triggers and animates the people not only who like him, but there was concern, according to people around Trump, that he had, that he was losing some mojo. He was having some trouble raising money. And this, he believes, would turn it around,"" she said.

2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who has since formed the new Forward Party, worried that the raid would contribute to the depiction of Trump ""against a corrupt government establishment. The raid strengthens that case for millions of Americans who will see this as unjust persecution.""

""Trump is winning the FBI-raid caucus going away—we’ll learn more, but this is his best day in pursuit of the 2024 nomination in a long time,"" National Review's Rich Lowry tweeted.

The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires presidential administrations to preserve certain documents.

Under the law, all White House staff must copy or forward any presidential records created on non-official electronic messaging accounts to their official electronic messaging account within 20 days of leaving office.

According to a 2017 memorandum issued by the White House counsel's office under the Trump administration, ""any employee who intentionally fails to take these actions may be subject to administrative or even criminal penalties.""

Trump, earlier this year, said the National Archives didn’t ""find"" the documents, but that they were ""given, upon request.""

The matter was referred to the Justice Department by NARA.

Dershowitz slammed the unprecedented raid of the former president’s home, and questioned the bureau’s decision to execute a search warrant, rather than issue a subpoena for the records in question.

""There was no reason not to issue a subpoena returnable tomorrow, so that there's no claim that Trump could've destroyed anything,"" Dershowitz told Fox News. ""This should've been a subpoena, not a search warrant.""

He added: ""If it is a search warrant, it has to have a high level of cause demonstrating that the evidence would have been destroyed.""

Legal scholars note that when individuals previously violated the law regarding classified documents, the Justice Department has opted to either not prosecute or settle for lesser charges.

""The Presidential Records Act is not commonly a subject of criminal prosecution, even in the most egregious cases,"" said Jonathan Turley, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. ""These incidents have generally been handled administratively.""

Trump made the raid public Monday evening, saying in a lengthy statement that ""nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.""

""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said. ""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections.""

""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before,"" Trump said.

""What is the difference between this and Watergate, where operatives broke into the Democrat National Committee?"" he continued. ""Here, in reverse, Democrats broke into the home of the 45th President of the United States."""

Senior correspondent Laura Ingle hosts this multi-part Fox Nation Audio podcast that examines the unsolved murder mystery of the more than ten people, many of them sex workers, found on Long Island.

On a December morning more than a decade ago, a police dog stumbled across a set of female human remains on the south shore of Long Island, New York, along the edge of Ocean Parkway in Gilgo Beach. Law enforcement soon discovered the remains of three more women, stuffed in burlap bags found in thick bramble off a stretch of highway.

Months later, the body of 24-year-old sex worker Shannan Gilbert was also discovered near Oak Beach, not far from the “Gilgo Four,”. Also found were the dismembered remains of other women, a man dressed in female clothing, and a toddler, scattered in various locations throughout Long Island. Investigators announced that a serial killer (or killers) was to blame for the murders. But to this day, no suspects have been publicly named and no arrests have been made in a case that shook a quiet, sleepy beach town to its core, and captivated the nation.

In this Fox Nation series/Fox Audio podcast, produced by Fox News’ Investigative Unit, find out what law enforcement is currently doing to solve the case using new technology. You’ll learn new details from a former escort who believes she spoke with the Long Island serial killer. And hear from an investigator who helped solve the Golden State Killer case and what he believes can be done to lead to capture of the killer."

You’ve heard the expression, “dance like nobody’s watching,” but in Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s case, she’s dancing like her city isn’t experiencing record high rates of homicide, violence and shootings.

She was captured doing the ‘cha cha slide’ at a back-to-school bash on Saturday but meanwhile 53 people were shot, 7 fatally, over the weekend.

How tone-deaf can she possibly be?!

Ya know, there’s nothing wrong with letting your hair down but perhaps Mayor Lightfoot could dedicate a little more of that time and energy into rehabilitating her lawless city!

In 2021, her city’s homicide rate was almost 3x higher than LA and 5x higher than New York City’s! And those cities are also incredibly dangerous, so that’s saying something!

Perhaps Mayor Lightfoot should electric slide way over to Chicago PD headquarters and ask her officers how she can better support THEIR efforts!

It’s a record-breaking exodus with over 1,000 NYPD officers set to leave the department in 2022, many before their full pensions set in.

Why? Well it’s not hard to figure out. Law enforcement has never been an easy job but when you take that, add the defund and demonize movement, plus felon coddling policies like so-called “bail reform” and mix in Democrat politicians who have turned their backs on officers, this is what you get.

So now what? The already increasingly dangerous, violent and lawless streets get worse.

Policing isn’t a job, it’s a calling but with few incentives left, we can’t be surprised that fewer brave men and women are willing to answer the call.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, I am a proud Trump supporter BUT I would like to see DeSantis as our ’24 nominee.

Longtime Rep. Peter Welch is considered the overwhelming front-runner over two other rivals in the Democratic primary.","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

A pivotal showdown for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in battleground Wiscons takes center stage on Tuesday, as four states from New England to the upper Midwest hold primaries.

The fight for Wisconsin’s GOP gubernatorial nomination between former conservative Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and businessman Tim Michels is the latest test of GOP clout between former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence, one-time running mates who could potentially face-off against each other for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

Kleefisch and MIchels are the front-runners in a field of four Republican candidates that also includes state lawmaker Timothy Ramthun. The GOP primary winner will face off in November with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who faces no primary challenge but who’s being heavily targeted by Republicans as he seeks a second term.

Michels is a multimillionaire owner of a construction company who in early June was endorsed by Trump. Two weeks ago, Pence once again broke with his former boss as he backed Kleefisch.

KLEEFISCH LANDS ANOTHER HIGH PROFILE CONSERVATIVE ENDORSEMENT

""There is no candidate for governor in America that is more capable, more experienced or a more proven conservative than Rebecca Kleefisch,"" Pence said as he teamed up with the former lieutenant governor at a campaign stop in suburban Milwaukee on Wednesday.

And Kleefisch touted that she's ""tested and proven and ready to go,"" and that she's ""the one who has won statewide four times.""

Two days later, as he headlined a rally for Michels in Waukesha, Trump charged that ""Rebecca Kleefisch does not have what it takes to beat Tony Evers… He's going to win if he runs against Rebecca.""

AFTER SNUB FROM TRUMP, KLEEFISCH VOWS SHE'LL WIN WISCONSIN'S GOP GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY

Asked by reporters on the eve of the primary for comments Trump’s derogatory attacks, Kleefisch responded: ""No thoughts that I can share.""

And she seemed to discount Trump’s endorsement of Michels as she emphasized in a Fox News interview on Monday that ""the voters of Wisconsin are going to be the ones who determine the outcome of this race.""

Michels’ campaign attempted to frame Kleefisch as a never Trumper, writing in an email to supporters on primary eve that ""if we don’t get Trump supporters to the polls to vote for Tim Michels on Tuesday, the Never Trumpers will win.""

The candidate Trump backed in last week’s GOP gubernatorial primary in Arizona, former TV news anchor Kari Lake, narrowly edged real estate developer and Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson, who was supported by Pence.

But in May, conservative Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, who was endorsed by Pence, trounced his Trump-backed challenger, former Sen. David Perdue, in the state’s GOP gubernatorial primary.

Besides Pence, two other potential 2024 GOP White House hopefuls, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former South Carolina governor and former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, endorsed Kleefisch this summer. Haley campaigned with the former lieutenant governor and helped her raise roughly $100,000.

Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes is his party’s all-but-certain Senate nominee on Tuesday, after his leading rivals dropped out of the race in recent weeks and endorsed him. Barnes is also backed by national progressive champions such as Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Barnes is part of a primary field that also includes four lesser-known Democrats.

President Biden narrowly carried Wisconsin as he won the 2020 election, and on Friday at his rally, Trump blasted Republican state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos for not embracing his unproven claims that his 2020 loss to Biden was due to massive voter fraud.

While Vos — who’s the state’s longest serving Assembly speaker — launched a controversial investigation into the 2020 election in Wisconsin and took a lead in passing a series of bills that tightened voting access in the state, he’s resisted Trump’s repeated calls to try and decertify the 2020 election results.

Minnesota

Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota faces a long shot primary challenge as he seeks a second term. Three Republicans are running in their party’s primary, including doctor and former state Sen. Scott Jenson, who landed the state GOP’s endorsement.

There's a special election on Tuesday in the state's primarily rural 1st Congressional District, along the state's southern border with Iowa, to fill the seat left vacant after GOP Rep. Jim Hagedorn died of cancer in February. The winner will serve the remainder of Hagedorn's term through the end of the year.

But complicating matters is that this isn't the only election in the district. There's also the reguarly scheduled primary

In the state’s Minneapolis-centric 5th Congressional District, progressive first-term Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, a member of the ""Squad,"" is facing four primary challengers. One of them — former Minneapolis City Councilman Don Samuels — is endorsed by a handful of former Minnesota mayors and has spotlighted his law enforcement support while criticizing Omar for pushing to dismantle the city’s police department.

In Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District, in the Twin Cities southern suburbs, all eyes are on November’s general election, when Democratic incumbent Rep. Angie Craig and 2020 GOP nominee Tyler Kistner will face off in a rematch.

Connecticut

Three Republicans are running in Tuesday’s Senate GOP primary in Connecticut, with the winner facing off in November against Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal. They are former state House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, businesswoman Leora Levy and businessman Peter Lumai.

It’s been 40 years since a Republican won a Senate election in the blue state of Connecticut.

Vermont

The Senate seat held for nearly a half century by retiring Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy is up for grabs.

Longtime Rep. Peter Welch is considered the overwhelming front-runner over two other rivals in the Democratic primary. Former U.S. attorney Christine Nolan, Army veteran Gerald Malloy and investment banker Myers Mermel are seeking the Republican nomination.

Multiple White House staffers and Democrats have taken to social media attempting to rebrand President Biden as ""dark Brandon"" amid a series of legislative victories.

""Dark Brandon is crushing it,"" Andrew Bates, the White House deputy press secretary, tweeted Sunday evening along with an image of Biden with laser eyes.

""Your malarkey has been going on for long enough, kiddo,"" read the image's caption.

Bates then tweeted another meme with the captions ""the malarkey will end"" and ""the dark Brandon rises"" in response to a tweet criticizing his initial post. The image appeared to depict Biden as Batman.

REPUBLICANS SAY DEMOCRATS WILL ‘PAY THE PRICE’ IN MIDTERMS FOR PASSING MASSIVE SPENDING BILL

But conservatives pointed out that the second image tweeted by Bates included eagle imagery resembling the logo used by the Nazi Party in the 1930s.

""Personally, I'm not surprised that you're tweeting out Nazi eagle imagery of your boss who reminisces about his segregationist 'mentor,'"" Abigail Marone, a spokesperson for Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., tweeted.

""'Dark Brandon' started as Chinese propaganda and then the White House co-opted it using Nazi Eagle imagery..."" Alec Sears, a digital staffer at the Republican National Committee, tweeted. ""They're not sending their best.""

""In 2020, the Trump campaign faced a week of stories and fact checks about a t-shirt with an eagle on it,"" Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for former President Trump's 2020 campaign, tweeted. ""Let’s see if a tweet from an official Biden White House account gets the same treatment.""

However, the apparent creator of the image said Monday that the image was never intended to be the ""Reichsadler"" seen in Nazi imagery, in an interview with The Washington Post. He said it was instead meant to represent a bald eagle.

The White House suggested the Nazi imagery allegation originated from Jack Posobiec, a conservative commentator linked to conspiracy theories.

""Who could have guessed that some Pizzagate/QAnon guy lies?"" Bates told Fox News Digital in an email. ""Have y’all seen this, though?""

Bates then pointed to a tweet Monday containing allegations from Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that former President Trump insisted U.S. generals be more like ""German generals in World War II.""

The ""Dark Brandon"" moniker appears to have started on Twitter in March among anonymous Biden supporters seeking to create an ""edgy"" version of the president, according to an online meme database. The meme also seeks to co-opt the ""let's go Brandon"" meme that originated among conservatives online and has become popular for those that oppose the Biden administration's agenda.

In addition, Rob Flaherty, the White House director of digital strategy, tweeted an image of Biden with laser eyes. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., also appeared to parrot the ""dark Brandon"" meme, posting an animation of Biden without pupils without a caption Sunday.

Megan Apper, who left the White House earlier this year to join the State Department, joined in on the ""Dark Brandon"" tweets, tweeting, ""Dark Brandon said ‘here’s the deal’ and then there was a deal.""

The apparent rebranding of Biden comes after several victories Democrats said showed the president has been successful overcoming gridlock on Capitol Hill.

In June, Biden signed a gun control bill that incentivizes states to approve red flag laws and introduce increased background checks, and last week, Biden signed the $280 billion Chips and Science Act, which boosts funding for the domestic semiconductor supply chain.

And, on Sunday, the Senate approved the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping budget reconciliation package that would introduce new green energy incentives and attempt to lower pharmaceutical prices.

""For decades, the gun lobby and the oil companies and the drug industry controlled Washington. And ordinary people suffered,"" Murphy tweeted. ""And [sic] then, in one summer, all that changed. The first gun safety bill in 30 years. Historic climate change legislation. Caps on drug costs. Just wow.""

However, conservatives were quick to criticize Democrats claiming victory and rebranding Biden as ""dark Brandon.""

The traveling nurse from Texas charged over a fiery car crash in a Los Angeles neighborhood that left six people dead, including a pregnant mother on the way to a prenatal checkup and a baby, was involved in more than a dozen prior wrecks, according to prosecutors.

Nicole Linton, 37, of Houston, was charged on Monday with six counts of murder and five counts of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence.

The announcement came after she allegedly barreled a Mercedes down La Brea Avenue on Aug. 4 at high speeds before running a red light and crashing into several vehicles in the Windsor Hills neighborhood, igniting a fiery wreck seen on surveillance cameras.

Linton’s attorney, Halim Dhanidina, requested that the arraignment be continued until October to allow time to review the nurse’s out-of-state history of ""documented profound mental health issues,"" according to the Times.

Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón said Monday that so far evidence does not suggest Linton was under the influence of alcohol but investigations into the cause of the crash remain active.

Those killed included 23-year-old Asherey Ryan, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant, her 11-month-old son and Ryan’s boyfriend. Two other women, who have yet to be identified, in another vehicle also were killed. Six other vehicles were involved in the collision, including five people with minor injuries in an SUV and another driver in another vehicle, according to prosecutors. The case remains under investigation by the California Highway Patrol.

""Today, we begin the process of holding accountable the person responsible for the deaths of six people, including a pregnant woman, and their families,"" Gascón said in a statement. ""This is a case that will always be remembered for the senseless loss of so many innocent lives as they simply went about their daily routines. I want to thank our prosecutors and the investigating officers at the California Highway Patrol for their work on this case.""

""While the wreckage of this fiery crash at this intersection was removed and traffic eventually resumed, there is catastrophic damage to the families and friends of those killed and injured,"" he added.

A massive search effort was underway Tuesday morning for the missing California 16-year-old Kiely Rodni, who vanished after telling family she was going to head home from a high school graduation sendoff early Saturday.

The Placer County Sheriff’s Office has said they were investigating a possible abduction because the girl’s SUV was also unaccounted for. Rodni graduated from high school two years early, and it is unlike her to run away or fail to come home, according to her mother, Lindsey Rodni-Nieman

A spokesperson told Fox News Digital Tuesday that investigators were still ""exploring all possibilities"" and confirmed that teens were using alcohol and drugs at the party.

Rodni had enough drinks to become drunk, according to her friend and another recent graduate, Sami Smith, who added that she did not believe the teen would have driven under the circumstances.

""At the point when I left, I thought she was going to stay there,"" said Smith, who departed the campground just a few minutes before Rodni was last seen. ""Everybody was camping. It was late enough that she should have stayed. She’s not the type to go and drunk drive or anything.""

Smith said she spent most of the night with Rodni.

""For the amount of drinks we both had together, she’s not that dumb,"" she added. ""I remember we were partying together. She was having fun. She seemed really happy -- she was like normal, just on an adrenaline rush. Saying ‘Hi’ to everybody.

But Rodni-Nieman, says her daughter texted her around 12:15 a.m. Saturday and said she was heading home. The family lives about 10 miles away from the campground at a lodge south of town.

Smith, 18, said that there were plenty of attendees whom she had not previously met, but none who seemed suspicious, gave unwanted attention or followed the pair around.

She said she didn’t notice anyone much older and that the party consisted mainly of teens, recent graduates and some college students from the surrounding areas. Some came from as far away as San Francisco, she said, but that was not unusual because the area is a summer vacation town.

""We met a few strangers together,"" she said. ""We both tended to trust people, I say tended to because now I don’t think I will continue to trust people. But she’ll give anyone the benefit of the doubt.""

Search crews and police from multiple counties scoured through the area beginning early Tuesday morning.

They started by searching Lake Prosser by boat as the land-based search party gathered on the shoreline.

Several aircraft, including helicopters and airplanes flying in formation above, all-terrain vehicles ranging including four-wheelers, trikes and dirt bikes. There were canines present and at least 100 members of law enforcement visible, including members of the FBI, who initially focused their attention on Campsite 4.

Crews pulled the boats from the water around noon and FBI agents were seen knocking on doors in the area. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""Right now, we are currently searching many areas,"" said Angela Musallam, the Placer County Sheriff’s public information officer.

The party, which stretched from Friday night into Saturday morning at the Prosser Family Campground in the Tahoe National Forest, involved dozens or hundreds of kids from a handful of nearby communities in the rural area, including Truckee, North Lake.

Around 12:15 a.m., she texted her parents that she was heading home. However, according to her mother, no one has come forward to say they saw her leave; no one was with her at the time; and nobody could remember when she left or seeing her car drive away.

Her phone, which last pinged at the party, has been turned off. Authorities say her vehicle, a silver 2013 Honda CRV with the California license plate 8YUR127, is also unaccounted for.

Authorities are urging teens who were at the party to come forward, and the community announced a ""Teen to Teen"" information gathering event from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. PT at the Tahoe City Save Mart in an effort to get attendees talking.

""We have had a lack of reach out from many Tahoe kids who were at the party or may know any information,"" the announcement reads. ""We are only looking for information such as who was at the party that you may have seen ad the times you came and left.""

Rodni’s mother is asking anyone who attended the party and their parents to look through their photos, social media posts and videos for any signs of Rodni. Home and business owners in the surrounding area are also asked to check their surveillance cameras for signs of the girl on Aug. 5 and 6.

Former Kamala Harris aide Symone Sanders, now an MSNBC weekend host, pleaded with people to stop calling the FBI search of former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence a ""raid"" on Tuesday.

""Please folks stop calling it a ‘raid,’"" she tweeted, later responding to critics in amusement.

Those words may have been directed at her fellow MSNBC hosts and producers, who used the ""raid"" language on the air often Monday evening.

""The FBI raided Donald Trump’s Florida home today on the 48th anniversary, today is the 48th anniversary of the day that Republican president Richard Nixon announced that he was resigning the presidency,"" anchor Lawrence O'Donnell said Monday.

Even former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo raised eyebrows on Twitter when he called on the Justice Department to justify the ""raid"" or else jeopardize other investigations like the one into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

MSNBC seemed to change tacks on Tuesday, with more hosts and reporters quoting Trump's ""raid"" language but mostly describing it as a search instead.

""Already the former president has called it a raid. And the veteran FBI officials telling us it’s more of a simple search, which is something they do routinely,"" reporter Kerry Sanders said on Tuesday.

Trump's statement about the FBI raid on Monday employed dramatic language as he declared his home was ""under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents."" The Secret Service allowed the FBI in to conduct its search, which Trump added was an ""unannounced raid.""

Sanders took heat from some conservatives and Republicans for her admonition.

""What is a woman? What is a recession? What is a raid?"" Ted Cruz communications director Steve Guest asked mockingly.

TWITTER SQUIRMS AS BIDEN LOOKS LOST, COUGHS THROUGH SPEECHES, SHAKES HANDS AFTERWARDS: ‘NOT FIT TO SERVE’

Sanders isn't the only MSNBC personality to take exception to the term. As the news broke Monday, anchor Alicia Menendez asked former FBI agent Frank Figliuzzi how the FBI was able to ""pull off this raid."" Figliuzzi, a national security contributor at MSNBC, objected to her terminology during his answer.

""Agents don’t like the word ‘raid,’ they don’t like it. It sounds like it’s some sort of extrajudicial, non-legal thing. It’s an execution of a search warrant. It’s a court-authorized search warrant,"" he said.

Many print outlets used the term ""raid"" independently of Trump, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Associated Press, Reuters, CNBC, Politico and others.

Sources told Fox News on Tuesday that investigators from the Justice Department visited Mar-a-Lago in June for a meeting about turning over records as part of an investigation into documents former President Trump allegedly took with him from the White House to his private residence when he left office in January 2021.

Trump's attorneys were present at that meeting and the sources say the former president himself stopped in to say hello for a few minutes.

The meeting came months after the National Archives — with assistance from the Justice Department — was able to get 15 boxes of documents sent back to Washington, D.C., after expressing concern they were in Florida.

The June meeting was about additional documents that were being sought. But following it, the Justice Department and FBI felt they weren't getting the same cooperation they had been receiving earlier in the probe, according to a source with knowledge of negotiations between Trump's team and the federal entities.

The perceived lack of cooperation is why a search warrant was requested and ultimately executed on Monday, Aug. 8, at Trump's Palm Beach property.

Sanders resigned as a top aide to Harris last year and joined MSNBC, where she hosts the weekend program ""Symone."" She's been followed in that regard by former White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who stepped down in May and will soon have her own Peacock streaming show.

A study posted in the National Library of Medicine documented the ""significant"" increase in body weight in children during coronavirus lockdowns and concluded that young people with pre-existing obesity, of Hispanic and African-American ethnicity and living in poverty suffered the most.

The study, published in July by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, combed through a biomedical literature database to assess ""the extent and risk factors of lockdown-induced weight increase"" as well as ""the impact of obesity on the risk of hospital admission in children and adolescents.""

The study found that a ""significant weight increase was reported in the majority of subjects"" regardless of age and gender, particularly in children who were already struggling with weight issues.

""The highest weight/BMI increase was observed in children with pre-existing overweight/obesity, of Hispanic and African American ethnicity, and in those living unfavorable socioeconomic conditions, therefore, most vulnerable to unhealthy lifestyle, food insecurity, family and social stress (i.e., lower parental psychological and educational support, and higher financial concerns/limitations), and with difficult access to academic resources and healthcare services,"" the study states.

The analysis, which is a conservative estimate based upon recent audit rates and tax filing data, shows that individuals with an annual income of $75,000 or less would be subject to 710,863 additional Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits while those making more than $1 million would receive 52,295 more audits under the bill.

To boost tax enforcement, the Inflation Reduction Act would appropriate more than $79 billion in additional funds to the IRS over the next decade, nearly doubling the agency's current budget. The IRS is expected to hire tens of thousands more agents to enhance enforcement efforts that are projected to increase revenue by $124 billion.

In response to criticism about the expected uptick in tax audits under the bill, IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said Thursday that ""audit rates"" will not increase relative to recent years.

The legislation doesn't explicitly guarantee that Americans making under $400,000 won't see tax increases under the IRS provision. The bill states that it is not ""intended"" to increase rates for taxpayers who aren't in the top 1% of earners.

""There is language in this bill that provides some guidelines, but it's not at all a guarantee,"" William McBride, the vice president of federal tax and economic policy at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, told FOX Business in an interview. ""It indicates that the intent of the increased spending is not to target those earning less than $400,000. But intent is a somewhat squishy word.""

""The fact of the matter is most returns report income under $100,000,"" he continued. ""That's where the money is, so to speak.""

The FBI raid on former President Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago has unleashed a familiar euphoria among critics who have longed for the scene of agents descending upon the president's residence in a criminal operation.

One MSNBC pundit declared on Monday night, after the news of the raid broke, that day of the ""orange jumpsuit"" may finally be at hand while another simply exclaimed ""hallelujah."" It was a tad premature since we do not even know if classified material was found and, if so, whether there is a criminal case to be made from such a discovery.

I previously testified in Congress on the earlier seizure of the boxes at Mar-a-Lago under the Presidential Records Act and how criminal prosecutions have been rare under the law. Nevertheless, criminal charges are possible, including under Section 2071 which states that anyone who ""willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates or destroys … any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited … in any public office."" That crime, however, requires a showing of not just negligence but ""an act is ... done voluntarily and intentionally and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids.""

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA 'UNDER SIEGE' BY FBI AGENTS

Notably, even the most serious cases of mishandling classified records have not resulted in major charges. One example is that of former Clinton National Security Adviser Sandy Berger who was found to have secretly stuffed classified material into his pants and socks to remove them from a secure facility. He then hid them in a spot to be retrieved later. It was a flagrant and premeditated violation of federal law and put national security secrets at risk.

Yet, Berger was allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and did not have to serve any jail time. Indeed, his security clearance was suspended for only three years.

However, critics were not particularly interested in whether Trump might have some suspended misdemeanor sentence. Rather, even before learning if any evidence of criminal conduct was found, critics turned to the ability to use the charge to disqualify Trump from future office.

Section 2071 has excited the imagination of such critics because of a line that states that a convicted party can ""be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.""

That enticing possibility has already been highlighted by Marc Elias, Hillary Clinton's campaign lawyer who was a critical player in pushing the false Russian collusion claims in the Steele dossier. In addition to accusations that he may have lied about the funding of the Steele dossier, Elias has been sanctioned in court for his conduct representing Democratic causes.

RAID ON TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO HOME BY BIDEN'S POLITICIZED FBI MEANS US NOW A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY

Yet, Elias was not alone citing the possible use of a Section 2071 charge to block Trump's expected presidential run in 2024. Former federal prosecutor Harry Litman even suggested that this could be the actual plan of the Justice Department to end Trump's political career: ""So this could be the whole enchilada in terms of DOJ resolution.""

Consider that culinary-legal analysis for a second. The claim is that the Justice Department may be actively seeking to use a charge to block Trump as the real motivation for this raid and possible charge. There is not a hint of concern over the FBI being used to achieve such a political purpose. That is putting aside the fact that, unless there is evidence of a ""willful and unlawful"" effort to conceal or retain such material, the FBI could end up an enchilada short of a combination plate for prosecution.

There is also a significant constitutional hurdle facing this latest means of barring Trump from office. This is not the first time that this disqualification argument has been made and scholars have previously raised constitutional objections to it.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

The problem is that the law would add a qualification or condition that is not stated in the Constitution. There are constitutional ways to impeach a president or to bar a former president from future office. The mishandling of official records is not one of them.

In analogous cases like Powell v. McCormack and U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, the Supreme Court rejected the authority of states to impose new qualifications for congressional seats under Article I. The same is presumably true under Article II when it comes to the chief executive.

There is ample reason to doubt that the presidency would be deemed barred by statute in this fashion. What would not be in doubt is how such a novel claim of disqualification would be received by millions of citizens already skeptical of the motivations of both the Biden administration and specifically the FBI.

The basis and even the motivation of this raid will become clear in time, including whether there is evidence of willful and unlawful conduct by the former president.

Marc Elias, a top lawyer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, said Monday that former President Trump could be disqualified from making another run at the White House in 2024 following the FBI raid of his Florida residence.

FBI agents executed a search warrant of Trump's Mar-a-Lago property on Monday reportedly seeking classified documents he allegedly took from the White House when he left office in 2021. The search warrant was conducted in connection with the National Archives, according to a senior government official.

This led Elias to cite U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2071 to highlight that Trump could be barred from seeking public office again, as the former president continues to drop hints that he will soon announce plans to seek a second term as commander-in-chief.

""The media is missing the really, really big reason why the raid today is a potential blockbuster in American politics,"" Elias wrote in a tweet.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA ‘UNDER SEIGE’ BY FBI AGENTS

Elias pointed to the passage of U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2071 that states, ""Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.""

However, legal challenges could make efforts to prevent Trump from running again under this code difficult, Elias noted in a follow-up tweet.

""Yes, I recognize the legal challenge that application of this law to a president would garner (since qualifications are set in Constitution). But the idea that a candidate would have to litigate this is during a campaign is in my view a ‘blockbuster in American politics,’"" he wrote.

The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires presidential administrations to preserve certain documents.

According to the National Archives, the presidential records in 15 boxes taken from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year include documents classified over national security concerns.

""It is important that we ensure they have access to support so that they are able to thrive.""

Kidd's comments come after researchers at the university anonymously surveyed close to 3,000 students in grades 7-12 in Appalachian region public schools, finding that more than 7% of respondents identified with a gender other than their sex at birth.

The findings follow a 2017 UCLA study that found West Virginia had the highest per capita rate of transgender youth in the country, estimating that just over 1% of the state's youth identified with a gender other than their sex at birth. The WVU findings suggest that the 2017 study may have severely underestimated that number, which researchers say may be due to the lack of ability to reach youth in rural areas.

""Despite the high prevalence of gender-diverse identities found in our Pittsburgh study, information about rural areas was still unknown,"" Kidd said. ""We suspect that many of the young people in rural Appalachia who shared their gender-diverse identities with us in this study may benefit from additional support, especially if they do not feel seen and supported at home and in their community.""

Kidd pointed out that the numbers could raise issues for public health officials, noting that gender-diverse youth are at increased risk of mental health disorders, suicide, and depression.

""Adolescent mental health is at a crisis point, according to the Centers for Disease Control,"" Kidd said. ""We have an access concern because so many young people need mental health services nationwide and we just don’t have enough mental health professionals to meet that need. It’s a growing problem and certainly gender-diverse youth are at an even greater risk.""

The research also comes as the state has been battling a lawsuit filed in 2020 against the state's ban on using Medicaid for transgender surgical procedures.

According to a ruling last week by District Court Judge Robert C. Chambers, the state's exclusion of gender transition surgeries for the treatment of gender dysphoria ""invidiously discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status.""

West Virginia is one of nine states with Medicaid rules that exclude covering transgender medical interventions, though officials in Ohio say their state's ban is not enforced and an Arkansas ban only applies to minors. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration is currently considering a similar exclusion on covering transgender medical interventions such as puberty blockers, hormones, gender transition surgeries or ""any other procedures that alter primary or secondary sexual characteristics,"" according to reporting from The Hill.

Evan Berryhill-Jewell was arrested on assault charges Monday, San Angelo police told The Advocate, according to New York Daily News. Berryhill-Jewell is the owner of Texas Angels Boutique, which is listed online as a women's clothing store.



She was reportedly released after posting $1,000 bond, according to Tom Green County Jail administrator Maj. Todd Allen, even though the sheriff's office website doesn't list a bond.

""In April, a video that showed a woman getting into an altercation with a queer couple quickly went viral,"" New York Daily News reported.

The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.","The sweeping climate, health care and tax bill that Senate Democrats passed Sunday includes one of the biggest tax hikes in decades, including a new levy for corporations that repurchase their own stock.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which passed along party lines with Democrats employing the budget reconciliation process, would raise an estimated $739 billion over the next decade, with the revenues going toward initiatives designed to combat climate change and curb pharmaceutical prices, as well as efforts to reduce the nation's $30 trillion debt.

It includes about $433 billion in new spending, while roughly $300 billion of the new revenue raised would go toward paying down the nation's deficit.

Some of the main revenue raisers stem from new levies on wealthy businesses, including a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases that is poised to take effect in 2023. Democrats, who estimated this new levy will raise about $74 billion over the next decade, are hoping to slow companies' tendency to buy back their own stock from investors with the tax.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT: WHAT TAX HIKES ARE IN THE BILL?

Companies have been allowed to buy their own shares since 1982, and the practice has since become commonplace on Wall Street. In 2019, stock buybacks hit a record $1 trillion, according to the SEC. Buybacks already hit a record $281 billion in the first three months of 2022, according to S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt. Although they were down 17.4% in the second quarter.

""I hate stock buybacks,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""I think they are one of the most self-serving things that corporate America does.""

The bill also imposes a 15% minimum tax on corporations based on profits they publicly report on their financial statements to shareholders. The minimum book tax would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income. Democrats said the levy would affect around 200 of the country's largest corporations with profits exceeding $1 billion and that pay less than the current 21% rate for businesses.

Experts expect the two taxes to drag on 2023 earnings, with Goldman Sachs forecasting a 1.5% decline per share of S&P 500 companies. The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.

UBS strategists led by Solita Marcelli, meanwhile, projected the new taxes would have a ""very minimal 1% drag on S&P 500 earnings per share, although some companies will be more affected than others.""

President Biden signed documents backing the entry of Sweden and Finland into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Tuesday.

""Putin thought he could break us apart… weaken our resolve,"" Biden said during a news conference announcing U.S. ratification of expanding NATO to include Finland and Sweden. ""Instead, he’s getting exactly what he did not want. He wanted the Findalization [Finland-ization] of NATO, but he’s getting the NATO-ization of Finland.""

Before signing the documents, Biden touted the expansion as a ""watershed moment"" that would enhance the security of ""not only Europe and the United States, but of the world.""

Biden urged the rest of the NATO allies to quickly ratify the expansion as well, noting the shared values Finland and Sweden have with the 30-member alliance.

""Sweden and Finland have strong democratic institutions, strong militaries, and strong and transparent economies that will meet every NATO requirement,"" the president said.

Finland and Sweden's membership will be the first significant expansion of the alliance since the Soviet Union's collapse in the 1990s. Their acceptance into the bloc marks a rebuke to Russia amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The Senate approved the move in a rare showing of bipartisan support, voting 95-1 last week in favor of the expansion. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was the only senator to vote against the measure, arguing that it would take focus away from China, which he considers America's primary geopolitical foe.

NATO MAKES THE RIGHT CALL ON SWEDEN, FINLAND IN A BIG, BOLD MOVE

""We can do more in Europe... devote more resources, more firepower ... or do what we need to do to deter Asia and China. We cannot do both,"" Hawley said, according to the Associated Press.

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell welcomed the news, arguing that the move would boost national security.

""Their accession will make NATO stronger and America more secure. If any senator is looking for a defensible excuse to vote no, I wish them good luck,"" McConnell said.

Biden immediately signalled his support for the measure after the Senate vote.

""I look forward to signing the accession protocols and welcoming Sweden and Finland, two strong democracies with highly capable militaries, into the greatest defensive alliance in history,"" Biden said in a statement last week after the Senate overwhelmingly approved their membership.

Finland and Sweden's application to join NATO came in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, with membership in the alliance being strongly opposed by the Kremlin.

NATO's 30 current member-states signed the accession protocol for the two countries last month, clearing the way for the members to formally ratify their membership.

All 30 current NATO members must ratify the decision to allow Finland and Sweden's membership before they can be protected by Article Five of the NATO Charter, which states an attack on one NATO country is an attack on all members.

CNN legal analyst Paul Callan called the Justice Department's raid on former President Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago home a ""daring and dangerous move"" that was ""not warranted"" if it was only about Trump holding onto classified documents after his time in office.

During CNN’s ""At This Hour with Kate Bolduan"" on Wednesday, the host spoke to legal analyst Paul Callan, who expressed hope that the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have something more serious on Trump than currents reports indicate, otherwise their raid on Trump’s massive West Palm Beach residence went too far.

Bolduan prompted Callan by bringing up speculation that the federal government conducted the raid to seize classified documents retained by the former president that he was not authorized to have after leaving the White House.

As Clinton 2016 campaign lawyer Marc Elias mused on Twitter Tuesday evening, Trump may have violated the Presidential Records Act of 1978, prompting the raid, and an ensuing investigation which could bar him from running for political office in the future.

Bolduan asked, ""If this becomes a Presidential Records Act violation, not more, do you think it’s enough to warrant all this?"" Callan responded that it’s not.

""No, it’s not enough to warrant all this,"" the legal analyst declared, adding, ""And this is a daring and dangerous move by the Department of Justice, to serve a warrant on a former president and raid his personal residence.""

Callan inferred that for the government to go this far, there must be ""something more"" than Trump merely holding onto classified documents after his term. ""So, I have to think that the Department of Justice must have something more than an argument about what kind of records have to be saved for a presidential library or the Library of Congress at some future date.""

""There’s more to this than meets the eye,"" Callan continued, adding, ""And I have to think that there’s something a lot more serious that they think is being withheld from the presidential collection.""

Former President Trump, who was in New York City during the time of the raid, condemned the action in a statement on Monday evening, calling it ""prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024.""

""Look, I think we don't, none of us know the facts and any comments are premature,"" Schumer said.

FBI RAIDS TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO: 'UNPRECEDENTED' FOR AGENCY TO EXECUTE SEARCH WARRANT AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT

National Journal's Josh Kraushaar remarked Schumer was ""visibly uncomfortable"" at the questions.

Maddow said she wouldn't press him further on the matter because she understood it would be ""futile.""

""Yes it would,"" Schumer agreed. After asking Schumer about the sprawling Inflation Reduction Act and working with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Maddow brought up the Mar-a-Lago raid again but noted that she understood he didn't want to talk about the substance of it.

""With the FBI raiding the president’s house today at Mar-a-Lago — and I know you don’t want to talk about that in substance — it seems clear, I think it seems obvious to both of us that we’re about to enter into a new and more intense area of the Republicans and the Trump-supporting Republicans really waging war on law enforcement and especially on the idea of federal law enforcement. And I wonder if you’ve been thinking strategically about that, about defending those institutions, defending that part of the executive branch that enforces federal law against the sort of politicized attacks that are coming their way?"" she asked.

Schumer said a large portion of Republicans have become ""MAGA Republicans"" who have ""little respect for rule of law"" and ""little respect for the balance of power of institutions.""

BNPL INCLUSION IN CREDIT REPORTS CAUSES GROWING CONSUMER CONCERNS, SURVEY CLAIMS

Americans coping with rising prices

Inflation is currently surging and increased in June to a new 40-year high, marking the fifth time it's broken that record this year. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 9.1% annually in June, hitting its highest point since November 1981, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

Because of this, many consumers are needing to dip into their savings or fund their purchases with credit, according to data from Morning Consult Economic Intelligence . Intentions to buy big-ticket items such as electronics, trips and vacations, home appliances and furniture have all decreased over the past year.

But despite these setbacks, consumer balance sheets are historically strong, according to Morning Consult. Net wealth as a share of disposable income is currently near a record high as household debt as a share of total assets is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, according to data from the Federal Reserve.

Because of this, some consumers, especially from higher-income households, are actually increasing their spending and expected spending, according to the Morning Consult report. Households with an annual income of at least $50,000 reported a 25% increase in monthly spending from May 2021 to May 2022.

""To put it simply: People still have the means to buy things, but they are expecting items to cost more,"" the report stated. ""And Morning Consult data indicates that they’re using BNPL to pay for some of them. The consistency with which U.S. consumers have used BNPL to fund their purchases throughout 2022 indicates that the payment form may be helping to keep their price sensitivity and substitutions at bay, and should be viewed as an indicator of the staying power of BNPL.""

The use of BNPL payments is not slowing, and the share of adults who used BNPL to fund a purchase at least once in the past month has not dropped below 16% in 2022, according to Morning Consult’s report.

Adults with annual income between $50,000 and $99,999 as well as those with an annual income of $100,000 or more are even more likely to have used BNPL for a purchase over the past month at 21% and 20%, respectively.

And consumers expect to continue using BNPL.

""As more retailers partner with BNPL providers and more payment providers create their own BNPL offerings, adoption and strong usage will likely continue,"" the report stated.

Across the country, librarians in schools and public libraries are stocking the shelves with material that is so pornographic that when parents have tried to read aloud and show the material at school board meetings, their microphones were cut off.

For progressives, the victim of the situation isn’t the children exposed to inappropriate content; the hero of the story isn’t the parents fighting for their kids’ innocence. No, the hero and victim of the coverage of these incidents are the librarians buying the sexually explicit content and recommending it to children.

Librarians are putting themselves on the front lines of a culture war, often shooting the first shots, and then bemoaning that they’ve found themselves under fire. But here’s the thing: Libraries have turned themselves into battlegrounds for these arguments, and librarians, one of the most radically progressive professions, have made them that way.

If you’re hosting drag queen story hour and stocking literal pornography on the shelves, you’ve surrendered the right to just ask for a quiet and respectful conversation about how you’re doing your job.

FLORIDA SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER DEMANDS ‘DISCIPLINARY ACTION’ OVER PORNOGRAPHIC BOOKS IN SCHOOLS: ‘I’M DISGUSTED'

How libraries are functioning is an assault on our children, paid for by our tax dollars. It’s long past time for parents to fight back, even if they’re called book banners for doing so. Librarians turned themselves into political warriors and are trying to make our kids into their foot soldiers. They don’t get to do so without a fight.

Progressives have received their talking points on the matter. Efforts on the part of parents to make sure that inappropriate and pornographic materials aren’t available to their children is called ""book banning."" In April, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., chairman of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, held a hearing to examine what he called ""the ongoing efforts across the country to ban books from schools and public libraries.""

A single mother of a middle schooler in Raskin’s district, Marilyn (who asked to be anonymous for professional reasons), shared with me her own story. She told me,

""My daughter started asking to go to the school early so she could spend some time in the library and came home with 'George' by Alex Gino. I had not heard of this book, and have yet to meet the school librarian. I asked my daughter if she picked out the book and she told me that the librarian gave it to her and said she thought she would like it. I still have no idea why.

""The school librarian also apparently said the same things about 'Rick' by Alex Gino. 'The Art of Being Normal' by Lisa Williamson also came home from the school library. These three books are the only books that came home from the school library in Montgomery County in 2021-2022.""

Gino’s book ""George,"" which has since been renamed ""Melissa,"" has been at the top of the American Library Association’s list of Top 10 Most Challenged Books for several years. The ALA, with its list, posit the book challenges are akin to censorship. Here’s a sample from ""George,"" just to get an idea of what many parents objected to:

""George stopped. It was such a short little question, but she couldn’t make her mouth form the sounds.

""Mom, what if I’m a girl?

""George had seen an interview on television a few months ago with a beautiful woman named Tina. She had golden-brown skin, thick hair with blond highlights, and long, sparkling fingernails. The interviewer said that Tina had been born a boy, then asked her whether she’d had the surgery. The woman replied that she was a transgender woman and that what she had between her legs was nobody’s business but hers and her boyfriends.

""So George knew it could be done. A boy could become a girl. She had since read on the Internet you could take girl hormones that would change your body, and you could get a bunch of different surgeries if you wanted them and had the money. This was called transitioning. You could even start before you were 18 with pills called adrogen blockers that stopped the boy hormones already inside you from turning your body into a man’s. But for that, you needed your parents’ permission.""

In 2021, Gino’s ""George / Melissa"" was finally getting knocked out of the top spot by a new book, ""Gender Queer,"" by Maia Kobabe. In its coverage of the ""book banning"" wars in the its Sunday newsletter, the New York Times interviewed Alexandra Alter, a Times reporter covering the publishing industry on the subject, and in its graphics illustrating the newsletter item, ""Gender Queer"" was one of the books highlighted.

Alter was asked, ""How are librarians responding?"" And Alexandra laid it on, thick with her reply, ""It’s heartbreaking for them. Librarians say they got into this field because of a love of reading and talking to people about books. Some have left their jobs; some have been fired for refusing to remove books.

When will U.S. foreign policy get better instead of worse?","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

President Joe Biden's foreign policy is a toxic mix of ideas from both extremes of the political spectrum.

On the one hand, Biden and company have embraced the Obama era policy of maximum restraint. The idea is that the less the U.S. engages in foreign affairs, the fewer problems it will have to deal with.

The problem with maximum restraint is that it can let a manageable foreign problem fester and grow into a tremendous problem. It’s like when a homeowner keeps putting off fixing a leaky roof; one day the ceiling will collapse.

WHITE HOUSE SUMMONS CHINESE AMBASSADOR AMID MILITARY EXERCISES, DIPLOMATIC RETALIATION FOR PELOSI TAIWAN VISIT

Maximum restraint can also lead to precipitous withdrawal from foreign engagements. This too can be disastrous. For example, Obama precipitously withdrew from Iraq, and ISIS promptly filled the vacuum. Biden did the same in Afghanistan, and we now know that Al Qaeda has already reestablished a foothold there.

The reality is: Whenever America walks away, our adversaries happily fill in. Just look at what happened at our southern border. As soon as Biden reversed all of Trump’s border security measures, the cartels started lining up people to come across.

On the other hand, Biden is often over-eager to engage on the world stage, turning American interests over to globalist management. The idea is that we can make the world safer, more equitable and more just if we follow the wisdom of global elites and govern according to international agreements on everything from climate policy and tax policy to labor policy and the treatment of women.

The problem with this is that it can sacrifice our national interests — and our sovereignty — abiding by international compacts that our enemies ignore, and our friends find preposterous. For example, the Chinese have zero intent of following the U.S. into the abyss of ""net zero"" green energy policy. To keep their economy growing, they are building coal plants right and left.

Yet, Biden persists in thinking that he and other leaders of developed nations can establish global ""norms"" by pledging to follow the dictates of Davos. This is like the little kid sitting in a grocery cart who thinks he is steering down the aisle.

By following these impulses to 1) do nothing and 2) tell everyone else what to do, Biden believes he is reducing risk and making a better world. In reality, what he has is a schizophrenic foreign policy that has increased global risk and left our friends and allies dazed and confused.

The most recent victim of this approach was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Her trip to Taiwan was important. And the stakes were high. China is America’s No. 1 threat, and Taiwan is the most serious issue that divides us. One would think every step the president would take would be serious, deliberate and proactive, because that is how serious people deal with serious risks. Not Joe.

His first instinct was to try to make the problem go away. So, he asked Pelosi to cancel the visit. This would have been a big slap in the face to Taiwan and a huge loss of face for the U.S.

When Pelosi refused, Biden then called Chinese President Xi Jinping and, after meekly reassuring him that the U.S. still clings to the ""One China Policy."" asked him to back down from his regime’s saber-rattling rhetoric opposing the trip. Again, no effect.

Indeed, throughout the crisis, Biden came across — to China, to Taiwan, to Pelosi and the rest of the world — as little more than a do-nothing Bystander-in-Chief. (Though, in fairness, he did tweet afterward.)

Once Pelosi left, China ramped-up its ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy ringing Taiwan with live fire drills. The administration response was mostly finger-waving at the Chinese, tut-tutting that they were not following the international norms as approved by our globalist overlords in Davos. Beijing must still be laughing.

But this is no laughing matter. Just ask Ukraine. When Putin threatened to invade, Biden tried the mix of do nothing, threatening with a handful of sanctions, and finger-waving about international norms. Rather than being deterred, Russia started a war that has harmed our economy and lowered our national security.

When will U.S. foreign policy get better instead of worse? The answer is: When the administration starts dealing with risks, rather than ignoring them."

Unknown to most Americans, the Chinese Communist Party has been buying our farms, land and even our homes for decades. Why? So they can take our food, technology and other resources for themselves.

What’s worse – it’s perfectly legal. That’s why I’ve introduced a bill to ban the Chinese Communists – and those acting on their behalf – from buying even another handful of American soil.

In recent years, China has exponentially increased its U.S. land holdings, especially of farmland. Between 2010 and 2020, China increased its agricultural land holding by nearly 2,500%, to encompass over 350,000 acres of American soil. Communists have not only purchased the fields and pastures of rural America, they have also taken control of food processing companies like the Virginia-based pork giant, Smithfield.

Chinese communists are gobbling up American agriculture in part because China can’t feed itself. While China is home to nearly 20% of the world’s population, it has less than 10% of the world’s farmable land. As a result, Beijing is forced to go elsewhere for sources of food, especially meat and other forms of protein.

TUCKER CARLSON: WHILE CHINA BUYS UP AMERICAN FARMLAND, WE MAY RUN OUT OF FOOD

And the CCP’s purchases in the U.S. have largely paid off. At the height of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, Smithfield made sure China got the pork it needed – while American groceries stores ran short. By taking our land and food-processing companies for themselves, Chinese communists benefit their own people and gain leverage over the United States in one fell swoop.

But that isn’t the only reason China is putting down roots in the United States. In some cases, they use our land as strategic outposts to steal advanced American seed and farming technology. In other cases, they’ve bought large tracts of land near U.S. military bases.

In North Dakota, a Chinese firm purchased 300 acres a few miles from a U.S. Air Force base, which reportedly is home to America’s most sophisticated military drone technology. The base also has been called ""the backbone of all U.S. military communications across the globe."" Similarly, in Texas, a former Chinese military official purchased over 130,000 acres on the U.S.-Mexico border conspicuously close to Laughlin Air Force Base.

As young Americans move off family farms and their aging parents increasingly retire from the business, China could buy even more. Millions of acres are expected to change hands in the next decade. We must ensure they don’t fall into the clutches of the Chinese Communist Party.

But the communists aren’t just capturing American agricultural land – they’ve also bought an astonishing amount of American real estate. Between 2010 and 2020, the American Realtors Association estimates that Chinese nationals bought over $200 billion worth of American real-estate, more than any other country in the world.

China’s 300,000-plus residential purchases in the United States since 2010 pose an unknown national-security danger, in addition to fueling the rising cost of living in places like California, where a disproportionate number of Chinese nationals buy. For America, allowing China to purchase our land is a lose-lose proposition.

Talk about a find.

A treasure trove of jewels, medallions and historic artifacts has been uncovered in the Bahamas that date back to the legendary 17th century Maravillas shipwreck — and the public can now get a look at it.

Nuestra Señora de las Maravillas (Our Lady of Wonders), a two-deck Spanish galleon, sank on Jan. 4, 1656, off the Little Bahama Bank in the northern Bahamas on a trip to Seville from Cuba.

It had been carrying numerous treasures of both royal tax and private property.

ALL-WOMEN ROWING TEAM BREAKS WORLD RECORD IN RACE ACROSS PACIFIC OCEAN

The 891-ton ship went down after colliding with its fleet flagship.

It struck a reef 30 minutes later — and ultimately sank.

The remains of the vessel were scattered for several miles across the ocean, with no significant portion of the ship left behind.

For more than 360 years, archeologists and adventurers have attempted to locate the debris that was lost in the wreckage.

And while much of the treasure — an estimated 3.5 million pieces, out of eight — was salvaged between 1656 and the early 1990s, modern-day technology tools such as high-resolution magnetometers, enhanced GPS and metal detecting have allowed Allen Exploration to bring to the surface riches beyond the imagination.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, Allen Exploration founder Carl Allen said that he and his team began pulling up precious artifacts in July 2020 near Walker’s Cay.

High-tech tools, plus the official permission they received from the Bahamanian government to search the Northern Bahamas area — known to be a wreckage hotspot — have made for ""quite amazing"" discoveries, the entrepreneur said.

""We’ve recovered thousands of artifacts,"" he said.

""Cannons, anchors, emeralds and amethysts … We’re up to about 3,000 silver coins and 25 gold coins,"" he said.

The water in the area only reaches up to 50 feet deep, while the sand can bury treasures down to 20 feet, he revealed.

Yet that didn’t stop Allen from proving his doubters wrong and discovering treasures that took his breath away.

""When I pulled up the first valuable item, I lost my breath,"" he said. ""I couldn't breathe.""

""I've been thinking about this my whole life.""

The fascinating finds also include Spanish olive jars, Chinese porcelain and iron rigging, according to an AllenX press release.

The team also discovered a silver sword handle belonging to the soldier Don Martin de Aranda y Gusmán; the item helped the teams identify these treasures as belonging to the sunken Maravillas.

One golden pendant with the Cross of Santiago was designed in the shape of a scallop shell.

Four pendants worn by members of the sacred Order of Santiago, a religious band of knights active in Spanish maritime trade, were also recovered.

AllenX considered the Order of Santiago jewels to be the ""star"" finds thus far.

One golden pendant with the Cross of Santiago was designed in the shape of a scallop shell.

It's reinforced by what appears to be an Indian bezoar stone — a famous European stone known for its healing properties.

Another golden pendant garners the same cross overlaying a large, ovular Columbian emerald.

Three gold chains were retrieved, including an 887-gram gold filigree chain made up of 80 circular links and decorated with four-lobed rosette motifs, most likely crafted in the Philippines, the group said.

One golden pendant with the Cross of Santiago was designed in the shape of a scallop shell.

AllenX indicated that no exact replicas of the chain exist from other excavations in museum collections or as seen in Spanish portrait art.

Allen Exploration archeologist Jim Sinclair told Fox News Digital that these artifacts reveal how people lived in the colonial period and in the New World.

As an archeologist of 40 years, and as an original explorer of iconic wrecks such as the Titanic, Sinclair said a recovery such as the one from the Maravillas reflects an ""amazing leap"" in technology.

The archeologist also considered the artifact analysis to be a ""really good development"" in terms of detecting human behavior and history.

Although the worth of these artifacts most likely add up to the millions of dollars, the items are priceless, said Bill Springer, Allen Exploration spokesperson.

None of the Allen Exploration findings will be put up for auction or for sale.

Instead, the finds will become part of an exhibit at Allen Exploration’s Bahamas Maritime Museum, located at the Port Lucaya Marketplace in Freeport.

MIAMI-BOUND BOAT CAPSIZES OFF COAST OF THE BAHAMAS

The museum is set to open on Saturday, Aug. 6, 2022.

It will reveal other exhibits about maritime history in the Bahamas, as well as the transatlantic slave trade and the Lucayan people.

Only 45 survivors

The Maravillas exhibit also showcases the story of the ship’s demise.

Of the nearly 650 passengers who were on board the ship, only 45 are known to have survived.

No human remains have been located.

The shipwreck was a ""tremendous blow,"" Allen explained, since Spain at the time was struggling financially and the boat was jam-packed with valuables.

It was one of the largest treasure ships to have ever left the Indies — which is why Allen said he expects more artifacts to be uncovered still.

The ""mother lode"" has yet to be discovered.

The ""mother lode"" has yet to be discovered, he indicated; and when it is, he said the haul would be ""extremely valuable.""

""The manifest usually on these old ships, a lot of times — it was only about half of what was on the ship because there was so much contraband,"" he said.

""So, that's what's exciting.""

Along with launching the museum, Allen is furthering his passion for discovery and education by developing underwater archeology programs for Bahamian kids.

""The big problem is, [the debris] is not going to stay there forever,"" he said.

""And it’s a playground of shipwreck.""

James Franco is stirring up controversy yet again, with news that he has been cast to play former Cuban leader Fidel Castro in a new film, ""Alina of Cuba,"" according to Deadline. This will be one of Franco's first acting roles since he was sued for sexual misconduct in 2019. But the sexual scandal is not the only reason people are upset with the casting news.

Jennette McCurdy is opening up about her childhood trauma.

McCurdy revealed she was ""exploited"" when she was a child actor on Nickelodeon’s ""iCarly"" and ""Sam & Cat.""

She says her overbearing mother and the television industry were both to blame, as they ""failed to protect her,"" according to the New York Times.

""My whole childhood and adolescence were very exploited,"" McCurdy said. ""…There were cases where people had the best intentions and maybe didn’t know what they were doing. And also cases where they did — they knew exactly what they were doing.""

'ICARLY' STAR JENNETTE MCCURDY RECALLS PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL ABUSE FROM MOTHER DURING CHILDHOOD

At the age of 16, McCurdy was entering her third year on the hit teen sitcom ""iCarly,"" where she made millions of young viewers laugh by playing the comedic character Sam Puckett.

The former actress gets candid in her new memoir, ""I’m Glad My Mom Died,"" in which she details her toxic relationship with her mother and her tumultuous time on Nickelodeon.

According to the New York Times, McCurdy, 30, wrote in her memoir about embarrassing moments on the children’s television network when she was asked to be ""photographed in a bikini during a wardrobe fitting and being encouraged to drink alcohol by an intimidating figure she simply calls the Creator.""

McCurdy pointed out that when her mother was present, she never interjected or instructed her daughter that this ""was the price of showbiz success.""

""Everyone wants what you have,"" she allegedly told her daughter.

In McCurdy’s memoir, which will be published on Aug. 9, she recounted auditioning for acting roles at the age of 6 and being ""shepherded"" into the work by her controlling mother. She also noted that she suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders and anxiety. McCurdy believed she owed her loyalty to her mother, who controlled every aspect of her life.

After McCurdy starred on ""iCarly,"" Nickelodeon promised her a spinoff series of her own, but walked back on their offer and made Ariana Grande a co-lead on ""Sam & Cat.""

McCurdy says she felt undermined by the network as they discouraged her from exploring other career opportunities outside the show. However, those rules did not seem to apply to Grande.

""What finally undid me was when Ariana came whistle-toning in with excitement because she had spent the previous evening playing charades at Tom Hanks’s house. That was the moment I broke,"" McCurdy wrote.

""Sam & Cat"" aired for only one season during 2013-2014, and after the show's cancellation, Nickelodeon offered the former actress $300,000 to keep her experiences at the network private, McCurdy said. She refused the offer.

Despite ""iCarly"" star Miranda Cosgrove saying that she and McCurdy quickly became friends on the show, she was not completely aware of the challenges her friend faced in her life.

It is not a converted VW this time around, however. It uses a custom aluminum monocoque chassis with rear independent suspension, rear-wheel drive and seating for two.

Full technical specifications haven't been revealed, but the plan is to offer it with two battery sizes. A 20 kilowatt-hour pack good for 150 miles of driving and a 40 kilowatt-hour pack that will let it cover 300 miles between charges.

THE VW DUNE BUGGY IS BACK FOR AN ELECTRIC FUTURE

The relatively long ranges provided by such small packs is enabled in part by the vehicle's low weight, which is estimated to be around 1,500-1,650 pounds.

The motor that comes with the larger pack will be rated at 202 horsepower and 240 pound-feet of torque, which the company says will allow it to accelerate to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds.

Pricing hasn't yet been announced, and the company hasn't clarified how the vehicle will be legally classified, but it will be offering 50 beta models for sale next year to buyers who agree to provide feedback before full production begins in 2024.

Is it Bigfoot — or a big fluke?

An Ohio woman claims that Sasquatch has returned to the woods near her home, based on an audio recording that she herself made of what she heard.

Suzanne Ferencak shared with Mansfield News Journal last week that this is the first time she’s ever recorded howling in her nearly decade-long tenure as a Bigfoot hunter.

An analyst described the two-minute recording as having ""high potential"" of carrying the sounds of one Bigfoot attempting to contact another, the News Journal reported.

""The first howler has a brassy tone to its voice that can be indicative"" of Sasquatch, the analyst said.

""There are a couple [of] features in the execution, such as shifting to an 'AA' phoneme at the end of the call that are indicative as well, most noticeable in the last two howls.""

Other wildlife experts aren’t so sure the sounds came from a Bigfoot creature, however, according to a USA Today report.

Workers at nearby Mohican State Park suggested that the sounds could’ve come from an alpha male coyote calling its pack.

The Bigfoot enthusiast first spotted the beast in May 2013 when it allegedly hopped over a back road southeast of her hometown of Loudonville, Ohio.

Ferencak told the News Journal that her rural home is prime habitat for Bigfoot and, for several years, experienced knocks and howls around the area — as well as other sightings, she said.

Ferencak finally caught the most recent loud howls on July 3 of this year. She suspects that the sounds came from a young or female Bigfoot calling to her babies.

It's an out-of-this-world project car.

A 1971 Chevrolet Corvette originally driven by Apollo 15 astronaut Al Worden, which was all but forgotten and left to the elements on a used car lot for years, will soon be ready to hit the road again.

The coupe was one of three that were leased to the mission's crew for a year for just $1 each by Melbourne, Florida, Chevrolet dealer and 1960 Indy 500 winner Jim Rathmann.

Rathmann had been leasing Corvettes to astronauts since the Mercury program, fully aware of the promotional value of having American heroes cruising around in his cars, but the Apollo 15 crew was the last.

GENERAL MOTORS BUILDING LUNAR TERRAIN VEHICLE FOR RETURN TO THE MOON

Command module pilot Worden and his crewmates, James Irwin and David Scott, ordered theirs in red, white and blue with coordinating stripes. Worden chose a white one with a 454 cubic-inch V8 under the hood and a Muncie 4-speed manual transmission.

He returned it at the end of the lease, and it was sold into private ownership, changing hands several times and ending up in Texas.

That’s where noted Corvette collector Danny Reed discovered it and added it to his collection in 2017, officially documenting its history in the process.

Reed also owns Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean’s 1969 Corvette, which he purchased directly from GM in 1971, along with Dave Scott’s blue 1971 model. Worden’s car was functional when Reed found it but very weathered from sitting outside for who knows how many years.

Max Kaiserman, the owner of space program merchandise marketplace Luna Replicas and friend of Worden’s, told Fox News Autos that Worden’s grandson, Will Penczak, found out about the car and visited it at Reed’s in 2020. Worden passed away the same year, and Penczak and Reed got to talking about what should happen to the car.

""We want to continue Al Worden’s legacy of inspiring young people to get into science and math and the arts""

Kaiserman and Penczak decided to team up and purchase it; not to fix and flip it at an auction but to become its custodians and share it with the world. They’ve now started Project AstroVette Endeavor and plan to restore it to some extent and use it as an educational tool by displaying it at science museums and other events.

OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD DRIVER EUGENE CERNAN RECOUNTS HIS RIDE ON THE MOON

""We want to continue Al Worden’s legacy of inspiring young people to get into science and math and the arts, all of which the space program and the Corvette represent,"" Kaiserman said.

The 80,000-mile car currently runs and is mostly-rust free, but it’s had some minor repairs and a few parts replaced over the years, so they’re still deciding what to do with it. Whether to preserve it as-is or bring it back to as close to original condition as possible.

A refresh to the standards of the National Corvette Restorers Society could run over $100,000, according to Kaiserman, while an extensive rotisserie show car-quality restoration might cost a quarter-million or more.

They’re open to any support for the project and are also asking anyone with photos of the car from the 1970s to share them to help get a better sense of its original condition, right down to what tires were on it when Worden had it. As of now, they only have one photo from Life magazine featuring the three astronauts and their cars parked behind the mission's Lunar Roving Vehicle, which was the first to go to the moon.

""How incredible is that the first astronauts to drive on the moon were also the last to drive Rathmann Corvettes,"" Kaiserman said.

But one man, Dustin, said: ""I think it's kind of a waste because we have more important things to worry about right now. The climate is important, but when people can't afford to feed their families or make a good wage, they're going to worry about that before they worry about the climate.""

The Senate on Sunday passed the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, which included $369 billion in spending for climate initiatives while imposing a 15% minimum tax on large corporations. The act could reduce U.S. carbon emissions by around 40% from 2005 levels by 2030, the research firm Energy Innovation found.

Another man told Fox News: ""it's getting bad, when you start to see wildfires, floods, glaciers melting, there's a lot of problems out there.""

""There's a very real prospect for a fourth year and potentially a fifth year of drought,"" Ekdahl told Fox News.
The former climate and conservation manager for the California State Water Resources Control Board, Max Gomberg, also felt Newsom wasn't properly handling water resiliency.","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Gov. Gavin Newsom has mishandled California's severe, years-long drought during his time in office, while the state's farms face diminishing yields, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News.

""I think Gavin Newsom has failed when it comes to water,"" McCarthy, who represents a district in California's Central Valley, said.

For the second time in nine years, California is facing a generational drought – a period of dryness so severe, they're typically thought to only occur once per generation, according to Erik Ekdahl, the California State Water Resources Control Board's deputy director for water rights. The Golden State has also endured a megadrought – a drought that lasts longer than 20 years – since 2000, Ekdahl said.

""I think the state has actually done some remarkably good planning and preparation and implementation for drought,"" Ekdahl told Fox News.

DROUGHT-PARCHED WEST LOOKS TO MIGHTY MISSISSIPPI FOR SOLUTIONS TO WATER CRISIS

Regardless, farmers' yields and, consequently, their businesses, are suffering, said Sam Parnagian, a third generation California Central Valley farmer. Over one-third of the country's vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts are grown in California, according to the state Department of Food and Agriculture.

""You'll go see tens of thousands of acres that used to have nuts, almonds, pistachios, and they're just bare,"" Parnagian told Fox News. ""It's just all dust.""

California saw a brief reprieve from drought in 2019, just months after Newsom took office, according to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Drought Center. But by 2021, the state was once again plunged into severe dryness on a wide scale – and it could get worse.

""There's a very real prospect for a fourth year and potentially a fifth year of drought,"" Ekdahl told Fox News.

Newsom, a Democrat, needed to use the drought-free period to prepare, McCarthy said.

""You should store it in the abundant years to have it for the years coming forward when it comes to drought,"" McCarthy, a Republican, told Fox News. ""That would show you good management.""

McCarthy's district includes part of Kern County, 70% of which is characterized as facing ""exceptional"" drought conditions, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Exceptional drought, the most intense and devastating type of drought, can lead to widespread wildlife death, the removal of orchards, increased chances of wildfire and low crop yields, according to NOAA.

LAS VEGAS 'WATER COPS' PATROL FOR WATER WASTERS AMID UNPRECEDENTED DROUGHT

Newsom outlined a 142-step plan in 2020 to make California more resilient to drought. It included long-term projects such as new water storage construction, surveying for new water sources and the deconstruction of dams.

Many of those haven't been built, according to a progress report published in January. Ekdahl said many of the water projects could take years to be completed.

""They haven't built any new water storage, no new dams,"" McCarthy told Fox News. They continue to let water go out into the ocean.""

Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment.

""The Governor has worked with the legislature to invest $8 billion to implement the strategies in the Water Resilience Portfolio , which focuses on diversifying our water supplies, enhancing ecosystems, improving infrastructure and ensuring California is better able to manage hotter and drier weather"" Erin Mellon, a Newsom spokesperson, told the Los Angeles Times in July.

CALIFORNIA REDUCES SUPPLIES TO WATER AGENCIES AMID DROUGHT

But others agreed with McCarthy.

""These days, the Newsom administration and Legislature have done little more than engage in water shaming,"" Steven Greenhut, the R Street Institute's western region director, wrote in the Orange County Register. ""Where are the plans to bolster our water-storage capacities?""

Newsom in 2021 asked Californians to voluntarily cut water use by 15%, but in March 2022, usage increased by 19%. The governor threatened to make restrictions mandatory in response.

""There’s no need to shame Westerners for their water usage, but there is reason to shame our officials for not doing their part to upgrade and build new water infrastructure,"" Greenhut wrote, noting that Newsom should use California's nearly $100 billion surplus to invest in water facilities. He also blamed former Gov. Jerry Brown for inaction during another drought reprieve when he was in office.

Yet Newsom has also faced criticism for not imposing harsher restrictions.

""We know it’s an election year and Newsom doesn’t want to anger voters, but failing to impose mandatory water cuts in the midst of this crisis demonstrates a stunning lack of leadership,"" the Mercury News and East Bay Times editorial boards wrote.

HOUSE APPROVES BILL TO HELP WEST FIGHT WILDFIRES, DROUGHT

About 80% of water use in California is used for agriculture, according to the state Department of Water Resources.

""We're one of the most fertile lands in all the world, and we should be using it to maximize our industry here in California and food for the world,"" Parnagian told Fox News.

But the drought has even restricted farmers' water usage, consequently lowering their economic output, according to Ekdahl.

Some livestock farmers have even had to sell their cattle, a move that could cause beef prices to surge, FOX Business previously reported.

""You're seeing that people are starting to farm to the water that's available,"" Parnagian told Fox News. ""And in doing that, we're limited on the crops we can grow. We're limited on the yields that we can get.""

California rice producers are weighing importing from Japan and South Korea as domestic production has severely dropped, S&P Global Commodity Insights reported.

The former climate and conservation manager for the California State Water Resources Control Board, Max Gomberg, also felt Newsom wasn't properly handling water resiliency. But Gomberg, who said he left his post because the governor wasn't aggressive enough on climate change, felt agriculture has received preferential treatment.

""There are the zillions of acres of almonds and grapes. It’s not sustainable,"" Gomberg told the LA Times. ""Everyone knows it’s not sustainable, just like everyone knows the amount of withdrawals from the shrinking Colorado River system are not sustainable.""

Meanwhile, only five of California's 17 major reservoirs, which provide water for agricultural use, are over 50% capacity, and eight are below 35% capacity, according to the California Department of Water Resources.

""What we're seeing just over the last nine years or so, seven of the last nine years have been dry or critically dry,"" Ekdahl told Fox News. ""That's just put long-term stress on our reservoirs, how we use water and ecosystems and people that depend on it."""

Three comics separately said freedom of speech will prevail over a small, but vocal group of cancel culture warriors aiming to censor comedians.

""Comedians just need to stop buying into all the noise, and they need to just start telling jokes how they want,"" Tyler Fischer, a New York stand-up comic, told Fox News. ""You're never going to develop as an artist unless you cross the line.""

Comedians, like Dave Chappelle, have been high-profile targets of cancel culture in recent years. Most recently, Minneapolis' First Avenue canceled Chappelle's sold out show hours before his set time after the storied venue faced backlash from its staff and community over the superstar comedian's jokes about the transgender community.

""Too often, too much credit is given to the way people interpret what you're saying or what you're doing as a comedian rather than what your real intentions are,"" Josh Denny, a Los Angeles comedian, told Fox News.

DAVE CHAPPELLE COMEDY SPECIAL QUIETLY RELEASED ON NETFLIX FOLLOWING ‘THE CLOSER’ TRANSPHOBIC JOKE CONTROVERSY

""When venues like First Avenue cave to the mob, that's what's dangerous,"" Denny continued. ""That basically tells all those transgender people that what they think Dave Chappelle saying about them is true, and that's not the case at all.""

The comedians told Fox News they believed the people aiming to censor comedians represented a small, but over-pronounced portion of America.

""We've just inflamed the very small minority of people who are sensitive and giving them superpowers,"" Fischer said. ""I don't think America has gotten too sensitive.""

Denny similarly said: ""The people that want to censor comedy or cancel comedians who are being edgy, taking risks, pushing the envelope, I think they're a very, very organized, vocal minority of people. There really is a clamoring and I think a resurgence of audiences that just don't want politically correct comedy anymore.""

Chrissie Mayr, a New York stand-up comic, told Fox News that censoring comedians is ""the most selfish thing you can do.""

""It's like 'Oh, I don't like this comedian … Not only do I not want to see them, but I want to make sure nobody else can see them,'"" she said.

JOHN CLEESE SAYS WOKENESS HAS A ‘DISASTROUS’ IMPACT ON COMEDY

Yet comedians have altered their jokes to align with shifting societal norms throughout history, Kliph Nesteroff, a comedy historian, has written.

""The tug of war between censorship and free speech has been part of comedy for its entire existence,"" Nesteroff wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed. ""It is likely to continue.""

He provided examples of 20th century comedians getting arrested or banned for their jokes.

Still, Fischer said modern cancel culture censored his own comedy for nearly a decade out of fear.

""I've been terrified to kind of step outside of that, you know, woke bubble,"" he said.

Over 80% of adults surveyed in a New York Times/Siena College poll in February said they felt it was a serious problem that some Americans wouldn't practice their freedom of speech out of fear of retaliation or harsh criticism. An April Morning Consult poll found that roughly one-third of adults felt they couldn't speak freely on social media.

Fischer also told Fox News he saw a shift once he began making of President Biden's age and low energy.

""I'd make fun of Donald Trump for four years,"" he said while impersonating the former president. ""Then, I made fun of Biden, and they're like, oh, you're far-right.""

NEWSWEEK COLUMN CALLS CHAPPELLE STAND-UP SHOW CANCELLATION ‘A VICTORY FOR CONFORMITY’

""I make fun of who is in power,"" Fischer continued. ""The left has gone so far that now anything sort of nuanced, in the middle, non-censored is considered far-right.""

The Media Research center identified more than 600 instances of social media users facing bans, restrictions or deleted content over posts criticizing Biden between March 2020 and March 2022. The Morning Consult poll found that half of Republicans didn't feel they could speak freely on social media compared to less than 20% of Democrats.

""We have almost this religious crusade now with the political sides over who is right and who is wrong,"" Denny, who has performed stand-up for 17 years, told Fox News.

""Everyone has some line, some sacred cow, that they believe is not okay to make fun of,"" Denny continued. ""And that could be their politics, it could be their religious beliefs, could be any of those things.""

Denny, Fischer and Mayr argued that protecting some groups can actually lead to more exclusion in comedy.

Chappelle has repeatedly faced criticism over his jokes about the transgender community. His Netflix special, ""The Closer,"" led to the tech giant's staff walking out in protest, though CEO Ted Sarandos defended the decision to provide Chappelle with a platform.

""Comedy is like the most inclusive thing,"" Fischer told Fox News. ""You can't slowly start cutting out topics and people that you can't joke about.""

Denny said: ""I will either make fans or not based on the kind of content I do, but I'd rather take the tortoise race to the finish of making the kind of fans I want than just doing what's easy to appease people."""

It was a telling indication of how involved and accessible the casino's next president plans to be.

Hired in June as Hard Rock's general manager, Faranca is being boosted to the top job now that current president Joe Lupo is heading to Las Vegas to run the Mirage casino once the company completes its purchase.

INFLATION CAUSE FOR 'CONCERN' AS TRAVEL-RELATED COSTS SOAR: HARD ROCK INTERNATIONAL CHAIRMAN

He's being handed the city's No. 2 casino in terms of money won from in-person gamblers (No. 3 when internet and sports betting money are included); a resort that has upped the city's game in terms of live entertainment.

But Faranca's gaze extends beyond the casino's walls to the city around it: He's been meeting with city officials on safety and cleanliness initiatives, pledges to continue Hard Rock's history of supporting charitable and community groups, and realizes the casino's success or failure rests squarely on the shoulders of its employees.

That's why late on a busy Saturday night, with a million other things to keep track of, he was huddling with the cleaning staff.

""I make it a point to go to pre-shift meetings with all the different departments, to thank them for what they do and connect with them,"" Faranca said.

A Philadelphia native, Faranca began his casino career in Atlantic City as a guest services manager at Harrah's and the Showboat. He worked in general manager roles at Philadelphia's Parx casino, the Palms in Las Vegas and at Maryland Live!, where he also was executive vice president, before joining Hard Rock.

Faranca says he has five core principles he plans to follow in his new job: Be the employer of choice in your market. Deliver exceptional hospitality. Clearly understand your property's strategy. Focus on the community. Have a commitment from ownership.

The casino is considering doing some hotel room and suite upgrades, and plans to diversify its entertainment lineup even more, he said.

Jim Allen, the global chairman of Hard Rock, has long pushed Atlantic City officials to make the city safer and cleaner, and has not hesitated to call them out when he feels conditions are poor. Faranca has already picked up that baton.

HARD ROCK INTERNATIONAL CHAIRMAN WARNS ECONOMIC CHALLENGES 'IN FRONT OF US ARE REAL'

""I hope everyone rallies behind the idea of a safe and clean Atlantic City,"" he said. ""When guests visit the city, they need a safe visit.""

He has already had discussions with City Councilman Kaleem Shabazz about the need for safety and cleanliness in the city, and will serve on the board of the Atlantic City Police Department Foundation.

""He is very sincere and open to working with government,"" Shabazz said. ""He seems to have a good sense of how a partnership should go and what issues in the community should be dealt with. I feel a strong sense of his community engagement.""

How did Guy Fieri rise to fame?

The $80 million deal represents a new level of success for Fieri who for most of his career was looked down upon by other celebrity chefs for his humble origins and simple tastes. Fieri started in the food industry at 10 years old and sold pretzels out of a stand. In France, he studied cooking and later moved to Las Vegas to attend the University of Nevada for hospitality management.

In 2006, Fieri was able to host his own show on the Food Network after winning in the second season of ""Next Food Network Star."" The show, ""Guy's Big Bite, only lasted for six episodes and Fieri earned approximately $1,000 per episode.

However, by 2010 the Ohio native was one of the most popular stars on the network when he premiered in Diners, Driven Ins, and Dives. The show follows Fieri on the road across the United States, Canada, and Mexico as he eats unique foods from popular local diners, drive-in restaurants, and dive bars.

By 2019, Fieri, along with the late Julia Child, became the fourth celebrity chef to be awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has been featured in more than 14 series on the Food Network.

How many restaurants does Guy Fieri own?

Fieri, via his company Knuckle Sandwich LLC, recently launched Flavortown Kitchens, a virtual brand with more than 175 locations worldwide, according to the chef's website. Moreover, Fieri owns more than 80 other restaurants under different brands, including Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar and Guy's Burger Joint on Carnival Cruise Lines."

Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

As a parent, you have two main options to help pay for your child’s college expenses: Parent PLUS Loans and private student loans .

The federal government offers Parent PLUS Loans and they come with unique benefits. Private loans come from private lenders, and they may have lower interest rates if you have good credit.

In this article, we’ll go over the main differences between the two types of loans to help you figure out which may be right for you.



Credible lets you compare private student loan rates from multiple lenders, all in one place.

Parent PLUS Loans vs. private parent loans

Both Parent PLUS Loans and private parent loans give you the opportunity to borrow money for your child’s higher education expenses. But they differ significantly in how interest rates are set and how you’ll repay them.

Parent PLUS Loans

The U.S. Department of Education offers Parent PLUS Loans, which are more formally known as Direct PLUS Loans. Graduate or professional students can take these loans out, as well as parents of undergraduate students.

You generally apply for these loans online through the StudentAid.gov website . In most cases, you won’t qualify if you have an adverse credit history, like a bankruptcy or foreclosure in the last five years or a history of late or missed payments.

Parent PLUS Loans have a fixed interest rate set by the federal government, which is currently 7.54%. That means the interest rate won’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You’re able to borrow up to the full cost of attendance, as determined by your child’s school, minus any other financial aid the student receives. When you take out the loan, you’ll also pay a fee of 4.228% of the loan amount. To pay the fee, the government will deduct a portion of the funds from each loan payout.

Private parent loans

Private parent student loans have no standard requirements. Instead, individual lenders set their own qualifications, interest rates, and repayment terms. But in general, lenders determine the interest rate based on your credit score. People with higher credit scores will qualify for lower rates, while people with poor credit will get higher rates, if they qualify.

You may find private parent loans with fixed or variable rates. Variable-rate loans typically begin with a lower APR, but this rate can rise over time. Fixed-rate loans don’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You usually have the option to make full principal and interest payments while your child is in school, or you can make interest-only payments to keep the interest from building up. Most private parent loans must be repaid within 15 years, though loan terms may be shorter depending on the lender.

The best private parent loans feature zero loan fees. Just like with Parent PLUS Loans, you’re solely responsible for repaying a private parent loan.

Cosigned student loans

A third option for helping your child pay for their college education is by cosigning their student loan. When you do this, your child is the primary borrower on the loan but you’re agreeing to be responsible for repaying the loan if your child defaults.

You may consider cosigning a private student loan with your child. In many cases, students aren’t able to qualify for a loan on their own since they may have little or no credit history. By cosigning, lenders take your credit into account as well. Any missed payments will hurt both your credit and your child’s. Many lenders offer a cosigner release option, which allows you to remove yourself from the loan once your child has made a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments.

A cosigner usually isn’t required on federal student loans.

When does it make sense to take out a Parent PLUS Loan?

A Parent PLUS Loan may make the most sense if you have fair credit. With these federal loans, the interest rate is the same no matter your credit score. If you don’t have any major credit problems, but your score simply isn’t the best, you may get a lower rate on a Parent PLUS Loan than you would on a private loan.

A Parent PLUS Loan may also be the best choice if you want to take advantage of one of the unique repayment plans the government offers:

Standard Repayment Plan — This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years.

This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years. Extended Repayment Plan — This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan.

This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan. Graduated Repayment Plan — This plan can help if you expect to have a higher income in the future. Your payments start low, but rise over time. Ideally, your income would grow along with your payment. You also have up to 10 years to repay your loan under this plan.

If your payments are still too high, you may have the option to combine all the Parent PLUS Loans you have into a federal Direct Consolidation Loan, which gives you the option of enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. With these plans, your monthly payment is capped at a certain percentage of your discretionary income. This can be a great option if your discretionary income is relatively low.

When does it make sense to take out a private parent student loan?

If your child has exhausted all their scholarship, grant, and federal loan options, and if you have excellent credit, a private parent student loan may make the most sense. You’ll likely be able to qualify for a lower rate than what you’d receive with a Parent PLUS Loan, saving you money in interest.

Private loans may also make sense if you’d like to choose a variable interest rate. This option gives you a lower initial rate, though it can rise over time. If you expect to pay off the loan quickly, though, you may be able to keep the lower interest rate and pay off the loan before it rises."

Brian Hall fled Shanghai in June to avoid another lockdown of his residential compound, escaping to China's tropical tourist island of Hainan where he could work remotely as a public health professor after undertaking 10 days of quarantine.

Hainan province is one of the several Chinese regions that had seen relatively few cases for more than two years which are now battling outbreaks, raising the risk of persistent tight restrictions as the economy weakens.

""My emotions naturally range from complete denial and disbelief, to anger, sadness, and eventually hopelessness,"" said Hall, who like millions in Shanghai, endured a strict two-month lockdown earlier this year.

Fascination with outer space and space creatures existed long before movie magic and popular culture created ""E.T.,"" ""Star Wars"" or even the ""Alien"" franchise. The final frontier has been a source of endless conspiracy and controversy for decades.

Now, Fox Nation's ""Alien Abductions"" hosted by Abby Hornacek unpacks some of the most legendary alien encounters and introduces people around the country who claim to have been abducted by extraterrestrial beings.

One of the several stories featured in the six-part series that Hornacek traces is the mysterious invention of The Integratron by George Van Tassel, a legendary alien abductee and ufologist who lived in the Mojave Desert in California.



Van Tassel is largely considered to be one of the first contactees with aliens and, in many ways, is said to have kicked off a movement in 1950s America after allegedly encountering an alien from Venus named Solganda.

This device became known as The Integratron, which he considered a time machine and a healing device.

Wolves were exterminated across most of the U.S. by the 1930s under government-sponsored poisoning and trapping campaigns. They were reintroduced from Canada into the northern U.S. Rockies in the 1990s.

Wilderness areas in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming have since become strongholds for wolf populations. That's helped fuel the species' expansion in recent years into portions of Oregon, Washington state and California.

""The hand that reaches for any of this wealth will be severed,"" Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah in Lebanon, said during televised remarks in Beirut Tuesday, according to Radio France Internationale (RFI).

The warning comes as the U.S. has intensified efforts to resolve the maritime border dispute between Israel and Lebanon, two countries that have been in an official state of war for over 70 years.

The Fourteenth Amendment, considered by both scholars and ordinary Americans to be one of the most consequential assurances of civil liberties in U.S. history, was certified as part of the Constitution by Secretary of State William Seward on this date — July 28, 1868.

Congress passed it on June 13 and it was ratified by the requisite 28 of then-37 states on July 9, 1868.

The Fourteenth Amendment encoded citizenship and due process for former slaves and is notably remembered, lauded, discussed and debated today for its landmark ""equal protection"" clause.

Second, giving up Viktor Bout to the Russians would harm American security.
President Biden must prioritize American interests and security by keeping Viktor Bout in jail.","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

President Joe Biden recently stated that his administration will ""pursue every possible avenue"" to bring U.S. citizens Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan home to the United States. Griner, a women’s basketball star, was sentenced last week by a Russian court to nine years in prison for marijuana possession, a crime in Russia for which she had pleaded guilty. Whelan is serving a 16-year jail term in Russia on espionage charges, accused of receiving and possessing classified information on a USB drive.

Secretary of State Anthony Blinken confirmed on Friday that the United States put forward a ""substantial proposal"" to Putin’s regime for a prisoner exchange, which reportedly would entail releasing Viktor Bout, a dangerous Russian arms trafficker, back to Russia in exchange for Griner and Whelan.

Bad idea.

Here are the top three reasons why this potential deal is not in U.S. interests and should not take place.

BRITTNEY GRINER'S SENTENCE PUTS SPOTLIGHT BACK ON STRAINED US-RUSSIA RELATIONS

First, the deal would embolden Putin to continue using ""hostage diplomacy"" to achieve his anti-American agenda. The Biden administration may bring two Americans home, scoring much needed political points -- at a time the president’s popularity is at historic lows -- but it will endanger many more Americans in the future and harm U.S. security. For years, the Russian government has used prisoner exchanges to retrieve Russian intelligence operatives, cyber criminals, and other types of Russian citizens held in U.S. prisons. Typically, however, the Russians get away with extorting much more valuable Russian nationals, in exchange for ordinary Americans who break Russian law, sometimes unwittingly. The Russians have perfected this playbook.

In April, the Biden administration exchanged a former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed, who was serving a 9-year sentence in a Russian labor camp, after being convicted of assaulting two Russian police officers while drunk on a visit to Moscow. The Russians got back Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot who was arrested by US special forces in 2010 in Liberia and sentenced to 20 years of prison time in US jail in 2011 for conspiring to smuggle more than $100 million worth of cocaine into the United States.

In 2021, the Biden administration quietly deported back to Russia the world’s most dangerous cybercriminal, Alexei Burkov, who had been sentenced to nine years in prison in America. An elite hacker, Burkov operated a website, which sold stolen numbers of credit and debit cards and extorted millions of dollars in ransom from US businesses, in return for unlocking infected computer networks. No Americans appear to have been released by the Russians, and there’s a congressional investigation underway to determine if the Biden Administration got anything in return.

In 2010, the Obama administration released ten Russian spies who had been infiltrated into the United States by Russian intelligence Service, the SVR, ten years earlier. These deep cover agents posed as Americans, blending into regular American day-to-day life, with the goal of penetrating top echelons of U.S. government in order to influence U.S. politics. Some of the sleeper agents in this spy ring got close to infiltrating Hillary Clinton’s circle. The U.S. government did not rescue any Americans out of Russia in exchange for these Russian sleeper agents. Instead, it brought in just four Russian citizens – one nuclear scientist, two intelligence operatives, and one KGB agent – who had been jailed by the Russians for providing secrets to U.S. government.

Second, giving up Viktor Bout to the Russians would harm American security. Bout is not just a regular Russian criminal. He is a high-value asset for the Russians, having ties to Russian spy services and indirect links to Putin himself. Bout is the world’s most prolific international arms trafficker and is serving a 25-year federal sentence for conspiring to kill Americans. This former military intelligence officer was conspiring to sell millions of dollars-worth of weaponry and 10 million rounds of ammunition to a Colombian narco-terrorist organization before he was arrested in a sting operation by U.S. law enforcement officers.

Bout has already spent 15 years in prison and has been thoroughly interrogated by US officers. As a highly trained military intelligence officer, he is also a gifted linguist with command of five languages. Bout undoubtedly has critical insights to share with his former comrades in Russian intelligence about what he experienced in the hands of U.S. debriefers and what was of interest to them.

Bout is connected to a Putin ally, Igor Sechin, who is a former deputy prime minister of Russia and currently the CEO of Rosneft, Russia’s state-owned energy conglomerate. Despite being isolated in a prison cell for over a decade, Bout never gave up his connection the Sechin, a fellow intelligence operative with whom he had served in the Soviet military running operations abroad.

Finally, by giving up Viktor Bout, President Biden would waste millions of dollars from the U.S. intelligence budget and demoralize dozens and possibly hundreds of American law enforcement officers, intelligence analysts, and support personnel who made it possible to capture this criminal. U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) officers finally arrested him in a hotel in Thailand in 2008 after almost a decade-long operation. Similarly, it took ten years of scrupulous work by US counter-intelligence to nab Putin’s spy ring of sleeper agents in 2010. With a stroke of a pen President Biden, and Obama before him, undid all that hard and often dangerous work by U.S. officers.

The Russians are acutely aware of President Biden’s naïveté, weakness, and his self-interest at a time his domestic popularity is at historical lows. They have floated the idea of adding another Russian criminal to the Griner-Whelan-Bout swap – Vadim Krasikov, another Russian spy who was sentenced to life in prison in Germany for having assassinated a former Chechen fighter on German soil.

President Biden must prioritize American interests and security by keeping Viktor Bout in jail."

""Equal Justice Under Law"" is engraved on the ornate pediment above the entrance to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Department of Justice and the FBI continue to hurl eggs at it.

Monday’s pre-dawn raid by a battalion of FBI agents on former President Donald Trump’s Florida home represents an abandonment of the cherished principle embedded in our Constitution that the law will be equally applied to all of its citizens.

Instead, political status now dictates whether a person receives fair treatment in a supposedly fair justice system.

If you check the box marked ""Republican"" on a political affiliation form, brace yourself for persecution and prosecution. If you check ""Democrat,"" you’ll be granted special elevated status. You’re untouchable. Just ask Hillary Clinton and Hunter Biden.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA ‘UNDER SIEGE’ BY FBI AGENTS

The evidence is indisputable that Clinton, while serving as secretary of State, converted tens of thousands of government records to her private email server in the basement of her home. In simple terms, she was stealing. She committed at least 110 crimes under the Espionage Act, representing the number of documents that the FBI determined were classified and top secret. She jeopardized America’s national security by exposing vital secrets to our enemies. The State Department discovered her computer was successfully hacked.

But that’s not all. When Congress instructed Clinton to preserve all of her documents, she destroyed more than 30,000 of them while wiping her server clean by using file-deleting software. Her mobile devices were broken in half or demolished with hammers. Her willful destruction of government property constituted another set of crimes, including obstruction.

Did the FBI ever raid Clinton’s home in Chappaqua, New York, to seize the incriminating evidence she kept there? No. Just the opposite occurred. Without authority, then-FBI Director James Comey absolved Clinton despite overwhelming evidence of criminality that he spelled out in his infamous July 5, 2016, news conference.

Months later, when Comey was fired for usurping the power of the attorney general, he stole government documents from the FBI. He did it for the admitted purpose of leaking them to the media to trigger the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Trump over phony allegations of Russian ""collusion"" that Hillary invented and the FBI exploited. We know how that capacious witch hunt turned out.

Did the FBI ever raid Comey’s home to retrieve the documents he pilfered? Did the DOJ charge him with theft of government property? Of course not. Don’t be silly.

This brings us to Hunter Biden. His notorious laptop contains a trove of damning documents and emails that offer compelling evidence of multiple enrichment schemes with foreign entities that forked over millions of dollars for access to Joe Biden and the power he wielded as vice president. Instead of a multiple count indictment for influence peddling, money laundering, tax fraud and foreign lobbying crimes, a four-year investigation has produced nothing.

RAID ON TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO HOME BY BIDEN'S POLITICIZED FBI MEANS US NOW A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY

Did the FBI ever raid Hunter’s home to obtain additional evidence? Or Joe Biden’s home, since the laptop implicates him as involved in his son’s profiteering scams? You know the answer. Don’t be dense.

The FBI doesn’t abide by the law when Democrats are involved. The agency obstructs it. They’re running a protection racket for the Bidens.

Recently we learned that ""highly credible whistleblowers"" within the bureau exposed an internal ""scheme"" by senior officials to bury evidence of Hunter’s corruption by falsely portraying the laptop’s contents as ""disinformation"" from foreign intelligence sources. Those same officials then allegedly sealed the truth in a file that only they could access.

Don’t forget – the FBI had the computer in its possession since December 2019 and knew it was real. The contents were fully analyzed and overflowing with evidence of influence peddling. But the agency and the Justice Department kept it under wraps, taking no action to charge or prosecute.

Ten months later when news of the laptop broke, 51 former intelligence agents publicly bashed it as Russian disinformation. The FBI knew it was a lie that the bureau helped invent. So, officials remained mute to help Biden get elected.

FBI Director Christopher Wray has done nothing to clean up his cesspool of an agency. He seems more interested in covering up acts of malfeasance and misfeasance. But the FBI is not alone in abusing its powers to protect partisan allies and punish political adversaries. The whistleblowers have also identified a top official within Merrick Garland’s Justice Department who has done the same.

The attorney general, who was appointed by Biden, is overseeing the investigation of his boss’ son. To the extent that the president was a participant and beneficiary in Hunter’s schemes, Garland has a disqualifying double conflict of interest. Yet, he has refused to appoint a neutral special counsel even though it is mandatory under federal regulations.

Garland despises Republicans for denying him a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. Covering up for a Democratic president is his vengeance. He’s the attorney general in name only. Like Robert Duvall’s character in ""The Godfather,"" Garland serves as Biden’s ""consigliere."" He’s Joe’s protector, by hook or by crook.

As long as Garland and Wray preside over our nation’s law enforcement, ""Equal Justice Under Law"" is a farce."

""Here I am with my head down. I’m feeling dejected,"" he said, describing his mood at that time.

""And now, people are starting to come up to me, all talkative and inquisitive with a whole different vibe. It was really weird.""

""The people up there were actually more … inquisitive than anywhere else,"" Barnes added.

""There were so many cyclists and everybody just, one after the other, pulled up from behind me and just, ‘Oh, where are you going, what are you doing?’ And we’d stop and talk and that turned me around back to being in a good mood.""

Along the way, one of his Facebook followers met up with Barnes; they rode together for a bit, which made time go by faster, he said.

""When you’re with somebody, they’re easy miles,"" Barnes said. ""It’s easy to pedal. You don’t realize you’re pedaling. You’re just having a conversation and moving along nice.""

Major milestone for this cyclist

While in Minnesota, Barnes reached another milestone: crossing the Mississippi River one last time.

Barnes ended up crossing the Mississippi River a total of nine times on his trip, which began back on Aug. 1, 2021 — a year ago.

""It’s actually pretty cool,"" Barnes said. ""To cross the Mississippi River nine times on nine different bridges on one trip is fun.""

Staying in a casino

During one of his last nights in Minnesota, a follower of Barnes gifted him a room stay at a casino resort.

The follower works as a security guard at the casino and offered Barnes a $25 voucher for dinner along with his room.

""The casino — that was terrific,"" Barnes said. ""That’s kind of like what I needed.""

""The only thing I gambled was — they give you a card with $5 on it that I turned into $11 and then spent it.""

He added, ""But I don’t gamble. I feel too guilty if I gamble.""

What Barnes said he enjoyed the most at the casino was getting to mingle with other people.

Next stop: South Dakota

When Barnes spoke with Fox News Digital about Minnesota in May, he had about 3,100 miles left on his trip. ""It’s counting down. It’s really good,"" Barnes said. ""It’s a really good feeling right now.""

After he left Minnesota on May 24, Barnes headed to capital 43 on his trip: Pierre, South Dakota.

After he visited each of the Lower 48 states, Barnes took a ferry to Juneau, Alaska, from Canada and rode on his bicycle to the capitol — as he explained early on that he would be doing.

From there, he flew with his bike to Hawaii and rode from the airport to the capitol building.

A Virginia-based disaster relief and humanitarian aid organization traveled to eastern Kentucky over the weekend to cook and deliver hot meals to those in need following last week's deadly flash flooding.

Mercy Chefs — founded by longtime chef Gary LeBlanc — has been serving millions of chef-prepared meals during national emergencies and natural disasters since the aftermath of Katrina in 2006.

Their efforts began just days after Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear issued a state of emergency due to the severe flooding that killed dozens and displaced many others.

After the team arrived in Whitesburg on Saturday, they heard stories of families who were thankful to be alive after nearly being swept away in the devastating floods.

Beshear said on Monday that the death toll climbed to 30 following the storms, flooding and mudslides that began early last week. He also noted that the death toll would likely increase as search and rescue operations continued.

Some people stranded on rooftops are still waiting to be rescued, and more than 23,000 households are currently without power, Beshear said in an update about the catastrophic flooding.

""Over the last few days, Eastern Kentucky communities faced the most destructive flooding in the state’s history,"" Mercy Chefs Facebook post read. ""The death toll continues to rise as search and rescue teams continue their work, and now there is more rain in the forecast this week.""

Mercy Chefs and its band of more than 25 volunteers have already served nearly 2,000 hot meals to victims and first responders on Sunday after setting up at Letcher County Central High School.

The team plans to serve hot lunches and dinner at the high school as well as distribute meals to multiple rural locations.

""It’s times like this that we feel so blessed to have bases strategically placed across the country,"" said LeBlanc.

For the last 16 years, LeBlanc and his team at Mercy Chefs have traveled to more than 150 disaster zones in 29 states and 12 countries.

And the Ford EcoSport took the long journey from India to showrooms before it was discontinued this year.

But there are also plenty of cars that are made in the USA that might not be so obvious.

Here are a few that are hiding in plain sight:

SUBARU OUTBACK

The Outback is the brand's best-selling car so far in 2022.

ACURA NSX

The Acura NSX has the sleek lines and technology of an exotic machine, but the mid-engine hybrid sports car was designed in the USA and has been built at Honda's Performance Manufacturing Center in Marysville, Ohio since 2016.

Olivia Newton-John’s only daughter is mourning the loss of the beloved singer.



The Grammy-winning superstar passed away on Monday at her southern California ranch, her husband John Easterling confirmed on Instagram and Facebook. She was 73.



Chloe Lattanzi also took to social media, where she shared a series of sweet photos featuring herself and the late ""Grease"" star from over the years. One of the heartfelt snapshots was a smiling selfie of mother and daughter.



While the post wasn’t captioned, the 36-year-old shared a photo of the pair just three days ago. Newton-John is seen beaming as she stands proudly next to her daughter.

""I worship this woman,"" Lattanzi captioned that post. ""My mother. My best friend.""



In May 2017, Newton-John revealed that she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her back. In 2021, she described how Lattanzi was been by her side.



""I’m so lucky to still be doing all these things,"" Newton-John told People magazine about attending Lattanzi’s wedding and releasing a single with her called ""Window in the Wall.""



""I don’t think I imagined living this long!"" she said. ""I feel very blessed.""

The outlet revealed that while both women have always been close, their bond only grew stronger while they quarantined in California together during the coronavirus pandemic. While Lattanzi later moved to Portland, Oregon, she revealed in late July that she had moved back to be near her mother.



""I worked my whole life, and the longest period I can remember being home was my pregnancy with Chloe and the first year or two of her life,"" Newton-John reflected. ""So it’s been wonderful reconnecting with my baby. She is my reason to be.""



In 2016, Lattanzi opened up to the outlet about what it was like growing up with Newton-John.



""As a kid, I wasn’t paying attention to her as a celebrity,"" she explained. ""She’s my mom, you know? Like, she takes me to school. I think as I’ve gotten older, that’s when I got to listening to her music. I did a re-imagining of ‘Magic’ because I loved it so much.""

From 1973 to 1983, Newton-John was among the world’s most popular entertainers. She had 14 top 10 singles just in the U.S., won four Grammys, starred with John Travolta in ""Grease"" and with Gene Kelly in ""Xanadu."" The fast-stepping Travolta-Newton-John duet, ""You’re the One That I Want,"" was one of the era’s biggest songs and has sold more than 15 million copies.



""Physical,"" the bouncy, R-rated smash released in 1981, was No. 1 for 10 weeks and was named Billboard’s song of the year despite being banned by some radio stations. An aerobics-friendly promotional clip, filmed in the early years of MTV, won a Grammy for best video.



Newton-John’s recent albums included ""Stronger Than Before,"" holiday collaboration with Travolta ""This Christmas,"" and the autobiographical ""Gaia: One Woman’s Journey,"" inspired by her battle with cancer and by the loss of her father.

Caregiver burnout is a significant concern, say health experts — and some states are now stepping up to offer online support to family members for free.

The New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA) and the Association on Aging in New York (AgingNY) recently announced a partnership with Trualta, a company that provides web-based educational skills training and a support platform.

The partnership supports those who are caring for their aging family members or friends at home.

The loved ones may suffer from conditions ranging from Alzheimer’s and dementia to developmental disabilities, stroke recovery, diabetes and more.

COGNITIVE DECLINE CAN BE AVOIDED WITH SIMPLE, EVERYDAY EXERCISES, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS

The platform also addresses caregiver wellness — and how to help a person transition from the hospital to home, a spokesperson for Trualta told Fox News Digital.

The initiative comes at no cost to residents of New York State who are providing unpaid care to a family member or friend, according to a news release from the New York State Office of the Aging.

New York joins five other states that are offering no-cost virtual help to individuals who are providing unpaid care to family members or friends in those states.

North Carolina, Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin and New Hampshire currently offer the online platform statewide to residents free of charge.

The Trualta program is also available free of charge in certain parts of 27 other states thanks to counties, state providers and community-based organizations, a spokesperson for the company told Fox News Digital.

There are efforts underway to make it available across all 50 states.

‘A big flip’

Caregiver Leda Rosenthal told Fox News Digital that she was 19 years old when her mother was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s disease at age 57.

""It was a big flip from being the one who was being taken care of to being the one who is taking care of my mom,"" said Rosenthal.

She described the difficult journey a person faces when taking on the caregiver role of a family member.

""Different challenges started popping up,"" she said.

She noted that her mom ""would wander. We have two big dogs, so she would get lost with them in the neighborhood.""

She also said her mom would leave the stove on by accident.

""Caregivers already feel socially isolated — and when the pandemic hit, this just made it hard to connect with others.""

Rosenthal told Fox News Digital the most taxing situation for her was the behavioral challenges in her mother that she experienced.

""My mom’s agitation, her anxiety — she started to have hallucinations as well,"" said Rosenthal.

MASSACHUSETTS MOM IS HONORED BY HER GROWN KIDS IN PICTURE-PERFECT PORTRAITS

She said she searched the web for hours at a time to try to find ways of successfully communicating with her mom.

""You get lots of misinformation online,"" she told Fox Digital News.

Aside from experiencing the behavioral issues of their loved ones, Rosenthal said there is the social isolation aspect of the work they do.

""Caregivers already feel socially isolated — and when the pandemic hit, this just made it hard to connect with others,"" she said.

Rosenthal decided to use her technology skills and personal situation to create a career path to help those who are aging remain at home, while also supporting those who care for them.

Caregivers can type in the scenario or symptom they're dealing with — and a selection of skills training information is offered.

She eventually met with Jonathan Davis, the CEO of Trualta, which is headquartered in St. Joseph, Missouri — and became the director of growth for the company.

Rosenthal described the website as offering a menu of options.

Instead of selecting a movie genre from a menu of movies, for example, caregivers can type in a scenario or symptom they might be dealing with — and a selection of skills training information will be offered.

You might say, for example, ""that your loved one is wandering,"" she said.

Then, you might be provided with ""steps to reduce wandering, broken up by different tasks,"" said Rosenthal in describing the specific tips offered.

While caregivers may not need to understand the science behind their loved one’s disease, they do need to learn coping skills in dealing with the challenges the disease creates for the person they're taking care of, said Rosenthal.

""What’s important as a caregiver is how you can respond to create a better experience for your loved one and for yourself to reduce your burnout.""

Caregivers, she said, ""don't know what skills go into agitation — but they know the problem that they are having.""

Rosenthal said that ""what’s important as a caregiver is how you can respond to create a better experience for your loved one and for yourself to reduce your burnout.""

CAREGIVER FATIGUE IN AMERICA IS RISING AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE: REPORTS

Joel Salinas, assistant professor of neurology in the Department of Neurology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told Fox News Digital, ""A diagnosis of dementia is not just a diagnosis for the patient — it’s also a diagnosis for the patient’s family and whoever else will be providing informal caregiving.""

He said as well, ""Caregiving can add a significant stress on the ability to participate in work and self-care — and there is also a great deal of uncertainty about so many aspects of care and what to expect. There are serious health and economic impacts from this kind of caregiving, so seeking support early and consistently can be critical.""

A Trualta spokesperson said the e-platform provides adult learners with the ability to scan and find answers quickly from evidence-based sourcing.

A study published in 2021 in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports found that 84.4% of participants who accessed the Trualta platform reported using skills they learned via the online platform.

The study also found that skills pertaining to behavioral management were reportedly used the most (60%) — while over half the caregivers reported allocating more time for self-care.

There are reportedly more than four million caregivers in New York State who provide nearly 2.7 billion hours of unpaid care.

Caregiver burden scores also appeared to decrease after people used Trualta for 30 days, according to the study.

The study's authors said in the peer-reviewed published report, ""This highlights the potential for online interventions to help informal caregivers access valuable techniques they can apply in their daily life.""

Rosenthal, commenting on that study, told Fox News Digital that ""when the caregivers are offered access to Trualta, in just 30 days we see the following: a 12% decrease in behavioral symptom severity, a 10% decrease in distress and a 30% improvement in caregiver fulfillment.""

A previous study also showed that when a family member is trained in caring for a loved one at home, that training may lead to reduced hospitalizations for the loved one.

Rosenthal said that when a family member receives training in prevention and in recognizing different signs and symptoms of conditions, for example — such as urinary tract infections — earlier treatment can be given.

Sixty-one percent of those caregivers worry about caring for a loved one, the news release said, while 70 percent reported experiencing at least one mental health symptom during the pandemic.

Jonathan Davis, CEO of Trualta, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that many caregivers have no prior experience and don’t know where to turn for help.

Talk about pedaling with purpose!

The Pan-Massachusetts Challenge (PMC), a two-day charity bicycle ride across the Bay State, is on the cusp of contributing an incredible $1 billion to the fight against cancer ever since its inception in 1980.

The 2022 PMC hits the streets this weekend (Aug. 6-7) with thousands of amateur bicyclists pedaling across cities, down back country roads and past Cape Cod National Seashore to raise money for the Jimmy Fund at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

Organizers hope to raise and donate $66 million this weekend alone.

The PMC has donated $831 million to Dana-Farber since its founding 42 years ago. Organizers anticipate topping $1 billion in donations by 2024.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO FOUNDED THE STURGIS MOTORCYCLE RALLY, ‘PUT THE BROTHERHOOD IN MOTORCYCLES’

The PMC is a tribute to the power of the human spirit to take pain and turn it into progress.

Founder Billy Starr, a native of Newton, Mass., west of Boston, launched the event in 1980.

He pedaled across the commonwealth with 35 friends, after watching three relatives, including his mother, succumb to cancer in the 1970s.

Betty Starr was just 49 years old.

""The PMC was not a career plan,"" Starr told Fox News Digital. ""But it was something I needed to do. I saw an opportunity to do something good. It lit me up.""

Thousands of other cyclists are lit up as well by the event each year.

Many describe the charity ride as a spiritual experience: two days spinning past the New England countryside in the hot summer sun, at times pedaling in pain or on the verge of quitting, the whir of bicycle gears often the only sound with thousands of others united in common purpose.

""The PMC is the single largest contributor to Dana-Farber and the Jimmy Fund and is responsible for 55 percent of the Jimmy Fund’s annual revenue,"" the PMC proclaims on its website.

Every rider dollar raised goes to Dana-Farber. The event's entire operational budget is funded by corporate largesse.

IN CAPE COD COMMUNITY, TRUE-CRIME AUTHORS CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT A TRUE CRIME THERE

The ride’s signature 212-mile route is a two-day ride from the hills of Sturbridge in Central Mass. to the sand dunes of Provincetown at the far tip of Cape Cod.

The PMC is supported by thousands of volunteers who do everything from make sandwiches at water stops to load rider luggage on trucks destined for Provincetown.

Countless thousands of Massachusetts residents and visitors line the road to cheer riders along the flagship route and the PMC's many secondary routes.

Starr and his team of 36 pedal partners raised a mere $10,000 in 1980.



But the original riders felt they had done something special. Many of those cyclists have returned each year since.

""Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong that year,"" said Starr. ""Yet everyone thought that it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.""

The ride has only grown since, which Starr pushing harder and demanding more from fundraisers and corporate sponsors each year.

Police are investigating Anne Heche for driving under the influence after she crashed her car into a home in Los Angeles on Friday.

The crash ignited a fire and almost destroyed the Mar Vista home.

Julia Jayne, founder of Jayne Law Group, P.C., explained to Fox News Digital that Heche would be charged in the crash, even if she wasn't under the influence.

""She's going to get charged,"" Jayne said. ""They're going to try to charge her with something for that. Reckless driving at a minimum, if she's got no alcohol in her system.""

Legal experts previously told Fox News Digital that Heche could be charged with reckless driving, hit-and-run and potentially DUI.

A public information officer for the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to Fox News Digital that authorities obtained a warrant for a sample of Heche's blood on Aug. 5.

The results of the blood test are pending and the investigation ongoing. If Heche is found to have been intoxicated during the crash, she will be charged with a DUI hit-and-run, LAPD told Fox News Digital. Authorities will then present the case to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office.

If drugs are detected in the LAPD's initial toxicology screen, authorities will have to run a confirmatory test to decide what level of drug was in Heche's system. This secondary toxicology report could take up to 30 days, according to a representative for the Los Angeles Police Department.

Jayne, a criminal defense attorney, told Fox News Digital that police taking time to investigate driving under the influence isn't ""unique"" to Heche's crash.

""If there's time, send it to the lab,"" she said. ""Get the blood test results, because also there are certain enhancements that they might want to charge depending on what the blood alcohol level is. So, it makes sense that they would do that investigation, not unique to her in any DUI case.""

Jayne explained that if the blood sample was taken within three hours of Heche's crash, the blood sample would be considered ""reliable for the time of driving.""

""They probably took it within that time, and that gives them some confidence,"" she said.

The ""Donnie Brasco"" actress is in ""extreme critical condition"" after the crash, a representative for the actress told Fox News Digital on Monday.

""She has a significant pulmonary injury requiring mechanical ventilation and burns that require surgical intervention,"" the rep said. ""She is in a coma and has not regained consciousness since shortly after the accident.""

Heche's rep shared on Saturday that she was in ""stable condition,"" noting that the actress' ""family and friends ask for your thoughts and prayers and to respect her privacy during this difficult time.""

The actress crashed her Mini Cooper twice on Friday, with the second crash igniting a fire that left a home almost destroyed in the Mar Vista neighborhood.

Heche suffered burn injuries but was ""conscious and breathing"" when paramedics removed her from the vehicle.

It's unclear when the results of her toxicology report will be returned to authorities.

LeBron James aims to give students at his I Promise School opportunities they may not have otherwise.

Recently, the NBA superstar's mission shifted into another gear.

James Bromsey III, a sixth-grader at James' school in Akron, Ohio, was given behind-the-scenes access before NASCAR’s race Sunday at Michigan International Speedway.

It was a fitting way to celebrate a student, whose father died four years ago. James Bromsey II shared a dream with family and friends that his son would be in the Akron Soap Box Derby, an event that dates to 1934.

NASCAR REVEALS WHY DENNY HAMLIN'S POCONO-WINNING CAR WAS DISQUALIFIED

""My son was six months old when his dad said he was going to be in the soap box derby,"" Tomika Pope recalled.

Bromsey fulfilled a promise to participate in the event in June. He was awarded a VIP experience by Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing, which put a paint job on Chris Buescher's No. 17 Ford to include logos, colors and words associated with the LeBron James Family Foundation.

Bromsey rode in a pace car, climbed up the spotter's stand and had a meet-and-greet session with Buescher.

""When did you do your first flip? he asked Buescher, who said he had not flipped, but did recently have his car catch on fire. Buescher went on to tell his guests that his dad got him started in racing.

SHOCK: NASCAR LAUNCHING ELECTRIC RACING SERIES IN 2023, LEAKED DOCUMENTS SAY

""Dad was into racing, too,"" Bromsey said quietly.

During a tour of RFK's hauler, which included a peek through an overhead opening at the space where the team stores its two cars, Bromsey's aunt Tracy Gholston was almost brought to tears. Gholston said her brother died in 2018, shortly after a bout with pneumonia.

""He could have led this tour,"" she said, choking up. ""It’s so emotional to see how God put this all together.""

Bromsey added: ""He would be telling you everything about all the cars.""

Bromsey also was given access to the garage area, where he posed for pictures and pointed toward the I Promise School logo on Buescher's car. He later walked behind the Mustang as it was pushed to the track and watched as Buescher finished 16th in the 37-car race won by Kevin Harvick in the No. 4 Ford.

James is a minority owner in Fenway Sports Group, a parent company of RFK Racing. He opened the I Promise School, which is at full capacity with third to eighth-graders, four years ago in a partnership with his family foundation and Akron City Schools, aiming to support kids facing the same problems he had during a challenging childhood.

Before the race, James wished Buescher luck on Twitter and celebrated Bromsey's experience.

""For James to have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity at the track is amazing,"" James said. ""He’s an incredible kid with a love for racing. We wanted to show him that anything is possible when you go out and chase your dreams. And with the No. 17 car representing all of us, we want all the kids from Akron to know that nothing is out of reach for them.""

Did a day at the track inspire Bromsey to someday become a NASCAR driver?

""I'll stick to the soap box derby,"" he said, with a grin."

New York Jets offensive lineman Mekhi Becton will ""more than likely"" miss the entire 2022 season after suffering a significant knee injury during training camp on Monday, head coach Robert Saleh revealed Tuesday.

Saleh said the 2020 first-round pick will be going for a second opinion on Wednesday to assess the injury to his right knee. According to ESPN, he suffered a fractured kneecap.

The 6-foot-7 lineman, who was rumored to have hit 400 pounds last season, was run-blocking at right tackle on the second play of team drills when he went down on the grass and immediately grabbed at his knee.

Becton was down for a few moments before trying to get up and needed assistance from trainers to walk off the field.

Saleh, anticipating the media and fan storm that would soon follow, defended Becton and his work ethic.

Cash advance loans differ from payday loans in some important ways, though.
Why you should avoid them: Cash advance loans are still significantly more expensive than traditional personal loans, or even credit cards.
Because of this added protection, lenders often have lower credit score requirements for secured loans and may even approve borrowers with a bad credit score.","Our goal here at Credible Operations, Inc., NMLS Number 1681276, referred to as ""Credible"" below, is to give you the tools and confidence you need to improve your finances. Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

Getting a personal loan can be difficult if you have a limited credit history or bad credit. Some lenders that target bad credit borrowers promise no credit check and fast funding. But these loans often come with expensive fees that can trap you in a cycle of debt.

If you’re struggling to choose the right personal loan — or finding it flat-out impossible — you may start to feel discouraged. Before you settle for an expensive loan product, though, here are some bad credit loans that you should avoid — whether you just need a few hundred dollars, want a $10,000 loan , or anything in between.



Credible makes it easy to see your prequalified personal loan rates from various lenders, all in one place.

1. Payday loans

A payday loan is a small, short-term loan intended to tide you over with an advance until your next payday. Storefront payday lenders typically offer these loans, but you may also find them online. Depending on your state, there may also be a maximum borrowing limit, often $500 or less. Lenders usually require borrowers to repay these loans in two to four weeks’ time, in one lump sum, plus fees.

If you’re struggling to make ends meet before your paycheck hits, this can seem like an enticing loan option, especially if you need same-day funds .

Why you should avoid them: Most payday loan lenders don’t have strict credit- or income-based qualifications, so they often loan money to people who may struggle to repay the debt . Additionally, these loans are notoriously expensive. While most states cap the interest that can be charged per $100 borrowed, this is usually in the range of $10 to $30.

While that may not sound like too much, when you consider the length of the loan term and the low borrowing limits, these fees work out to an astronomical APR. For example, a $100 payday loan with a two-week repayment term and a $15 fee equates to an APR of nearly 400%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

Compare that to the average interest rate on a 24-month personal loan — 8.73% in May 2022, according to the Federal Reserve — and it’s easy to see what a ""deal"" payday loans really work out to be.

2. Cash advance loans

A cash advance loan is similar to a payday loan, in that you can use its short-term funds to help you cover immediate or unexpected expenses. These loans can even be funded as quickly as the same day, depending on the lender.

Cash advance loans differ from payday loans in some important ways, though. For starters, you can usually borrow a lot more with a cash advance loan, with some lenders offering as much as $5,000. You don’t always have to repay a cash advance loan in just a few weeks, either; you may be able to take out a cash advance that you can repay in monthly installments.

Why you should avoid them: Cash advance loans are still significantly more expensive than traditional personal loans, or even credit cards. Depending on the lender, your cash advance loan could have an APR of 299% or more.

3. Car title loans

If you have bad credit and need to borrow money, using your vehicle as collateral to get a car title loan could be one option. But car title loans aren’t a good choice for most borrowers.

Title loans often have repayment terms as short as 30 days, though you might find installment options as long as 24 months. The amount you can borrow depends on your location, as well as the value of your vehicle — as long as you own your vehicle free and clear.

Why you should avoid them: The downside? You probably already guessed it: You’ll pay significantly more in interest with a title loan than with a traditional personal loan. It’s not uncommon for car title loans to have APRs in the triple digits.

More than that, though, you’re securing the loan with one of your most important assets: your car. If you were to default on your title loan, the lender could take ownership of your vehicle.

4. Pawn shop loans

A pawn shop loan is a short-term loan that’s secured by something you own, such as jewelry or other valuables. These loans typically allow you to access money quickly, depending on how much your valuables are worth.

Pawn shop lenders typically don’t run a credit check, so these loans can seem like a good option for borrowers with poor credit or those looking for a no-credit-check loan . The pawn shop will usually offer a percentage of the pawned item’s value in loan form. You’ll need to repay the loan by an agreed-upon date, or the shop keeps the item.

Why you should avoid them: If you repay the loan as agreed, you can get your valuables back. But your pawn shop loan will have accrued interest in the interim, which you’ll also need to pay. These loans also tend to have a variety of fees tacked on, such as storage, setup, and even appraisal fees. For this reason, a lower interest rate can be deceptive, as the loan will actually end up costing you considerably more in the end.

Try a personal loan instead

If you need funds for an unexpected expense, large purchase, or even to refinance high-interest debt, a traditional personal loan is often your best bet — even if you have bad credit. Here are some things you can do to increase your chances of qualifying for one:

Apply with a cosigner. Adding a cosigner with good credit to your personal loan application may be the answer to getting approved or snagging better interest rates. Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit.

Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit. Check your credit reports. If your low credit score is keeping you from getting a personal loan, it’s important to understand why. Check your credit reports to see what sort of negative items are bringing down your score. In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected.

In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected. Consider a secured personal loan. A secured loan uses one or more of your assets as collateral for the debt. Because of this added protection, lenders often have lower credit score requirements for secured loans and may even approve borrowers with a bad credit score. Some financial institutions might not even require a minimum credit score at all, as long as you’re securing the loan with an asset. But keep in mind that if you fall behind on your loan payments, the lender can take your collateral."

WHAT IS CASH-OUT REFINANCING AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

How mortgage rates have changed over time

Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac — 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates.

If you’re ready to take advantage of current mortgage refinance rates that are below average historical lows, you can use Credible to check rates from multiple lenders .

How to get your lowest mortgage refinance rate

If you’re interested in refinancing your mortgage, improving your credit score and paying down any other debt could secure you a lower rate . It’s also a good idea to compare rates from different lenders if you're hoping to refinance so you can find the best rate for your situation.

Borrowers can save $1,500 on average over the life of their loan by shopping for just one additional rate quote, and an average of $3,000 by comparing five rate quotes, according to research from Freddie Mac .

Be sure to shop around and compare current mortgage rates from multiple mortgage lenders if you decide to refinance your mortgage. You can do this easily with Credible's free online tool and see your prequalified rates in only three minutes.

How does Credible calculate refinance rates?

Changing economic conditions, central bank policy decisions, investor sentiment and other factors influence the movement of mortgage refinance rates. Credible average mortgage refinance rates reported in this article are calculated based on information provided by partner lenders who pay compensation to Credible.

The rates assume a borrower has a 740 credit score and is borrowing a conventional loan for a single-family home that will be their primary residence. The rates also assume no (or very low) discount points and a down payment of 20%.

Credible mortgage refinance rates reported here will only give you an idea of current average rates. The rate you receive can vary based on a number of factors.

When is it worth it to refinance?

Refinancing a mortgage can be a great way to save money. But it’s not always the best move for every homeowner.

People refinance for a number of reasons, including to get a lower interest rate, change their monthly payment amount and lower their interest costs. Generally, if you can lower your interest rate by at least 0.75%, refinancing might be a good move.

But before you refinance, be sure to weigh closing costs, and calculate how long it will take before your savings from the refinance cover the expenses of refinancing.

Credible average mortgage rates and mortgage refinance rates reported in this article are calculated based on information provided by partner lenders who pay compensation to Credible.

What is a good mortgage rate?

Generally, a good mortgage rate is one that’s the lowest you can qualify for based on your individual factors, such as credit history, income, other debts, down payment amount, and more.

A rate that’s good for your financial situation should result in a monthly mortgage payment that you can manage, while leaving plenty of room in your monthly budget to put toward savings, investments, and an emergency fund. And a good rate should be competitive with average rates in the geographic area where you’re looking to buy.

PRIVACY TIP: 5 WAYS YOU'RE BEING TRACKED YOU MUST STOP RIGHT NOW

Start with the outside

Keeping your phone clean isn’t hard with the right supplies and a little bit of elbow grease. Set down the paper towels and follow these simple steps for cleaning your screen, ports, and case.

Cleaning the screen

First, remove your phone’s case and accessories. You want to reach every nook and cranny.

A microfiber cloth works for wiping away smudges and grease, but I prefer screen cleaning wipes designed for smartphones. They’re just so easy. Skip paper towels. They’re too rough for delicate jobs like this.

I have purchased this 210-pack of screen cleaning wipes from Care Touch time and time again. Use them on smartphones, tablets, monitors, TVs, and remote controls. They’re scratch-free and made with anti-static tissue that cleans without leaving behind streaks or lint.

Don’t forget the ports

Your phone's ports collect dust, grime, and dirt. Avoid using cotton swabs, which leave behind fuzz and could leave you worse off than when you started. Toothpicks can work if you are very gentle, but breaking off the sharp end inside a port is easy.

I prefer tools made for the job. It helps that these are cheap.

This Skylety 17-piece phone cleaning kit is under $10. The kit includes anti-static brushes, nylon brushes, cleaning cloths and a de-dusting film. You can use them to clear the gunk out of your ports gently.

Scrub your case

If you keep your phone in a case, I bet you’re shocked every time you take it off and see all the grime collected inside it. You don’t need to be quite as careful with your case as your phone's screen and ports.

For plastic, rubber, and silicone cases, grab an old toothbrush and a bit of warm, soapy water. Use the toothbrush to reach all the corners and crevices. Rinse it thoroughly.

Very lightly dampen a microfiber cloth with water and a mild soap for leather cases. Lightly rub the case in circular motions.

After it’s clean, let your case dry thoroughly before you put it back on. Need case recommendations? I share some here, along with my favorite screen protector . This has saved me from cracking my iPhone several times.

Now that your phone is bright and shiny on the outside, let's dive into the inside.

Make your phone faster and more secure

Cookies, location services, and ad networks can slow you down and even pose privacy and security risks. It only takes a few minutes to clear out the junk bogging you down.

Delete apps you don’t use anymore

It's smart to inventory what apps are on your phone now and then. Delete what you don't use regularly. Delete or close down the account associated with the app before you remove it. Tap or click here for steps to do that the right way .

You can also take care of that on your computer. This digital tool shows you the best ways to delete unwanted accounts from almost every online service. Tap or click here to see how to delete your unwanted accounts.

On your iPhone, open the Settings app, tap General, then iPhone Storage. Scroll and select the apps you want to delete. Tap Delete App and Delete App again to confirm.

On Android gadgets, go to Settings, then tap Apps. A list of the apps on your phone will appear. Select the app you want to delete and tap Uninstall. (Note: Your exact steps may differ depending on the device's manufacturer.)

Check your permissions

Most apps on your phone collect info to learn more about you. This data can be used for targeted advertisements, marketing, and improvements to systems like search engines and voice assistants.

Give your phone a privacy checkup by reviewing the permissions you’ve given your apps. You might be surprised at which ones use your camera, microphone, or location data.

On your iPhone:

Open the Settings app. Scroll down and tap the Privacy icon.

Select a tool on which you want to check permissions, like Calendars, Location Services, or Camera. A list of apps that have access to these tools will appear.

On Android:

Open the Settings app > Privacy.

Tap Permission manager to see a list of permissions and the apps granted those permissions. You will see Body sensors, Calendar, Camera, Location, Microphone, and more.

Click an app to change its permission settings.

Clear the cache

Your phone's browser stores tiny files that help sites load faster and collect lots of data. You can wipe that out.

To delete the cache from your iPhone’s Safari browser, follow these steps below:

Open Settings, scroll down and select Safari.

Under the Privacy & Security section, tap Clear History and Website Data. This will remove browsing history, cookies, and other site data.

You can clear the cache from other apps, too. Tap Settings, General and iPhone storage, and scroll through your apps. They are listed by the amount of space they take from most to least.

If an app uses a ton of space, like more than 500MB, it's a good idea to uninstall and reinstall it later. You won't lose any personal information, but you may need to re-enter your login details.

To delete the cache from the Chrome browser on an Android phone, follow these steps below:

Open Chrome.

At the top right, tap the three-dot icon.

Tap History, then Clear browsing data.

At the top, choose a time range. To delete everything, select All time.

Check the boxes next to ""Cookies and site data"" and ""Cached images and files.""

Tap Clear data.

Clearing the cache from your apps can improve performance and give you more room for photos, videos, and new apps.

Open the Settings app, then tap Storage.

Tap Apps to see a list of your installed apps.

Find the application you want to clear the cache of and tap it. Tap Clear Cache to delete the app’s cache.

Android also allows you to free up space by deleting infrequently used apps and files. To access the Free Up feature, follow the steps below:

Tap Settings, then Storage.

Tap Free up space.

Your phone will recommend junk files, duplicates, memes, screenshots, blurry photos, and more for removal. Choose a category and tap Select files.

Choose each file you want to remove. At the bottom, select Move (number) files to Trash.

Update your operating system

If you want to protect your phone, you must keep its operating system and apps up to date with the latest versions.

To get the latest iOS updates on your iPhone:

Go to Settings > General and then tap Software Update. If you’re already running the most recent update, you will see ""Your software is up to date.""

If an update is available, tap Download > Install. You can also tap Later > Install Tonight or Remind Me Later. If you tap Install Tonight, your device will update automatically overnight.

If asked, enter your passcode.

To get the latest iOS app updates:

Open the App Store.

Tap your profile icon at the top of the screen.

Scroll down to see pending updates and release notes.

Tap Update next to an app to update only that app or tap Update All.

To get the latest Android operating system updates:

Open your phone’s Settings app.

Navigate to System > System update.

You’ll see your update status. Follow any steps on the screen.

To get the latest Android security and Google Play updates:

Open Settings, then tap Security.

To check if a security update is available, tap Security update.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there's been an increased focus on mental health, especially among young people. 1 out of every 6 children age 6 to 17 experience a mental health disorder every year, and now a new investment company wants to use technology to make them easier to treat. Telosity by Vinaj Ventures is a fund set up back in 2019 specifically to invest in companies that provide tech-based solutions to improve mental well-being among young people, a demographic used to doing pretty much everything on their phones or computers. The founder and CEO, Anish Srivastava, says he was inspired to start the fund when he saw how few mental health resources were available, especially for kids and teens. ""Accessibility is very difficult,"" according to Srivastava, ""and what tech does is it helps democratize access to care.""

And if Telosity is successful, in the near future, kids and teens might be meeting their mental health counselors in cyberspace, which the company wants to use as a jumping off point to meet young people in the space where they're most comfortable. ""We can use that as a place for resources,"", says Srivastava, ""whether its educational types of capabilities, self learning mental health, being able to provide tele-therapy solutions, et cetera.""

And it's not just scheduling apps and telemedicine; new advancements in virtual reality could make it much easier for doctors to examine - and also treat patients - in an online setting. Telosity has been seeing a growing market interest in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), and much of it focuses on mental health assessment tools for providers. All that could make it even easier for kids and teens to access mental health resources, since they don't even have to leave their homes in many cases.

It's also good news for businesses. Telosity released a report last month showing youth mental health solutions will be a $26,000,000,000 market by 2027, and the company calls that an unprecedented opportunity for businesses to beef up their bottom line, while also providing help to millions of the most vulnerable Americans. Srivasta says that could be a major selling point for investors in the mental health space. ""There's an opportunity to do good while investing and building sustainable businesses, and I think that's the driver for tech.""

The key to retrieving text messages

Your best bet for retrieving deleted messages is accessing an older backup of your phone. You can do that through iCloud for your iPhone.

There's a big caveat you need to keep in mind: Restoring your phone to a previous backup means you lose new data after that backup.

Now, it's worth saying that these steps don't always work. If you strike out, you can try contacting your phone carrier. It may be able to restore deleted messages for you.

Have an iPhone? Turn on iCloud and iCloud Backup

On an iPhone, you have access to 5 GB of free storage. You will likely need to upgrade to an iCloud+ plan to store multiple backups and all your photos and videos. See pricing and tiers here .

To retrieve deleted texts on an iPhone, you must turn on iCloud Drive and iCloud Backup. Here’s how to enable Drive.

Turn on iCloud Drive by going to Settings.

Then, select your Apple ID.

After that, tap iCloud.

Lastly, turn on iCloud Drive.

After that, you need to turn on iCloud Backup. Do this by opening Settings > Selecting your Apple ID > tapping iCloud and selecting iCloud Backup.

NOTE: You will lose all new data after that backup. Make sure those deleted texts are worth it. Here’s how to access them.

How to get back deleted texts on iPhone

Remember, when you access an old backup, you reset your iPhone to old settings. This could lead to a few issues. If you’re willing to risk it, follow these steps to see if you have a backup available:

Go to Settings.

Select your Apple ID.

Tap iCloud > Manage Storage > Backups.

Next, follow these steps to use that backup to restore your phone:

Head to Settings > General > Reset.

Select Erase All Content and Settings.

Tap Restore from iCloud Backup.

Sign in with your Apple ID and tap Choose backup.

Your phone will revert to its former version. Now you can start looking through old texts.

This method won’t work if you’ve never backed up your iPhone on iCloud.

""In the future, what we hope to do is connect a wireless chip integrated with this ink, so that we can communicate, or we can send signal back and forth between our body to an external device,"" said project leader Steve Park, a materials science and engineering professor.

Such monitors could in theory be located anywhere, including in patients' homes.

The ink is non-invasive and made from particles based on gallium, a soft, silvery metal also used in semiconductors or in thermometers. Platinum-decorated carbon nanotubes help conduct electricity while providing durability.

If your TV is ""smart,"" I have bad news. It’s probably keeping an eye on everything you do and sending that info back to advertisers.

You can stop that, at least to some extent. Tap or click for settings to change on your television to stop this privacy invasion.

The same is true for your streaming devices and services. Tap or click to limit tracking through Netflix, Amazon, Roku, Hulu and more.

With your privacy bases covered, consider your health. Here are a few tips to minimize eye strain, neck strain and eye fatigue.

1. Lighting matters

""You're going to ruin your eyes!"" We all heard that as kids sitting in front of the TV, right? Watching TV probably won't cause lasting vision damage, but it might strain your eyes.

A mellow, dimly-lit room is the best way to watch TV. Open windows, glaring track lights, and other distracting illumination sources make your eyes work overtime.

You don’t need a bunch of fancy smart lighting or gadgets, either. Draw the blinds, turn off the house lights, and stick to incandescent over LEDs if you prefer not to go full-on black-out mode.

Lamps and other lights can cause annoying reflections and glare. Choose ambient light sources muffled by diffusive domes or lampshades.

2. Smart formula to know if you’re too close

When it comes to eye health, you should sit far enough from the TV so your eyes won't be exposed to excessive glare.

The secret formula: Measure the width of your TV and multiply that number by five. This distance is the ballpark you should shoot for in your home theater, living room, or any other spot you have a TV. Now, it’s harder to stick to this formula with larger TVs.

The size of the room, the shape and number of seats you have to configure, and other factors like window placement also come into play. Some give or take is fine. Aim for at least about 10 feet away if you can.

3. Check your screen height

A TV installed too high or low can cause eye and neck strain. The most comfortable viewing experience is with the TV around eye level when you’re sitting. So, how do you set it up? Use a laser pointer or a long measuring tape to find your direct line of sight from the best seat in the house.

Have a friend or family member lightly mark the spot on the wall with a pencil. If you’re working alone, do your best to remember where the marker hit during the experiment. The center of your TV screen should sit about where you marked.

3 ways to find out if your smart TV was hacked (and how to protect it)

4. Turn down the brightness

Bright, concentrated blue light is harsh on your eyes. That’s why staring at your phone in a dark room can feel so jarring.

Is your TV backlit? An OLED? What HDR capabilities does it bring to the table? All this impacts what brightness is best. Your eyes will also give you lots of clues. Do you find yourself squinting when the room is dark? The TV is probably too bright.

Check your TV's user manual or click the settings menu to find the brightness. Don't just rely on one of the pre-sets. Tune up and down and see what's best for your space.

Take some time to play with color temperature, HDR settings, and image saturation, too.

Decades after they starved, beat and tortured the boy – caging him in a slatted wooden box the size of a coffin – an underage World War II veteran refused to speak about his former enemies with hatred. His story holds lessons about reconciliation for a nation battered by today’s culture wars.

Joseph Johnson was only 14 when he enlisted in the U.S. Army, a year before Pearl Harbor. He’d fled a difficult home life in Memphis, fibbed about his age to a recruiter, and managed to get lost in the shuffle. He was sent to Manila with the 31st Infantry Division, having no clue of the impending horror.

On Dec. 7, 1941, 10 hours after attacking Hawaii, Japan hit the Philippines. The largely under prepared U.S. and Filipino troops were plunged into battle. The boy fought bravely, loading machine guns and ferrying messages between headquarters and front lines. Once, to escape a sniper’s attack, he leaped into an empty foxhole, only to land on an enemy soldier crouching in the dirt. The boy fought for his life, subduing his opponent with his bare hands.

Joe had met an orphaned teenage girl back at a brothel in Manila, and they became unlikely friends who helped each other endure. When she’d become pregnant from her unfortunate job, Joe helped her seek sanctuary in a church. He paid the nuns for the girl’s room and board.

LAST REMAINING WORLD WAR II MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT TO LIE IN HONOR AT US CAPITOL

The memory of her friendship helped sustain the boy in the fight on Corregidor, where Joe and his fellow soldiers made their last stand. The allied troops were outgunned and outmanned, plagued with tropical diseases, and cut off from resupply. As their foodstuffs slowly diminished, they ate monkeys found in the jungle.

Finally, in May 1942, Gen. Jonathan Wainwright formally surrendered all allied troops in the Philippines. Joe laid down his arms and became a prisoner of war. He was 16.

At the brutal Nichols Field detail, Joe and fellow POWs were forced to extend an airstrip. It was backbreaking work with a pick and shovel in the broiling sun.

Joe suffered from a raft of tropical diseases, including pellagra, dry beriberi, scurvy and malaria. After being savagely beaten for a small rule infraction, Joe knew he wouldn’t survive Nichols Field. Feigning insanity, he sliced his arms with a sharpened spoon and smeared blood on his face, hoping the guards would send him to Bilibid Prison, where a few American doctors still practiced.

That’s when he spent a week locked in a cage. Naked, bloodied, prodded through the slats by his captors, the boy was given no food or drink. Rainwater kept him alive. Finally, he was tossed on the back of a truck and driven to Bilibid, where he slowly regained his health. His audacious plan had worked.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, AUGUST 2, 1943, JFK SAVES PT-109 CREW AFTER COLLISION WITH JAPANESE DESTROYER

But his horrors weren’t over. In October 1944, Joe and 1,600 POWs were loaded onto a ship to work in Japan’s mines. By the time they reached port six weeks later, only 450 POWs were still alive. Suffering malnutrition and a grisly leg injury, Joe was held at the Fukuoka POW camp until Japan’s surrender in August 1945. At last, he came home to freedom. Joe was 19 years old and had grown to 6 feet, 4 inches. He weighed only 109 pounds.

Post-war, Joe struggled with severe PTSD. Counseling, family and faith helped. He learned the wisdom of forgiveness, as recorded in his journal: ""Life is too short to hold on to hurt. Whether you’re hurt from being abused as a POW or from your daddy leaving when you were young, you got to set that hurt down. You’ll only hurt yourself when you harbor hate.""

In his senior years, Joe became active in veteran causes, using his scars to help people heal. He became a rebuilder of lives, a restorer of spirits. Whenever he spoke about the past, he never used the derogatory word for his former captors, always speaking about them with respect.

For America today, embroiled in culture wars and divided by hostilities, a nod to Joe Johnson may well be part of the solution to rebuilding the country. Each person holds an individual responsibility to promote peace. More understanding is the answer, more finding common ground, more forgiveness.

January 24, 2006, our family went from watching the nightly news to being the news story, that day, my niece Jennifer Kesse was abducted in Orlando, Fla. and our lives changed forever.

On the morning of Jan. 24 Jenn failed to report to her job as a finance manager at a well-known timeshare company. She was 24 years old. She was last heard from at around 10 p.m. the night before when she spoke by phone with her family and boyfriend from inside her condominium.

In the weeks following Jenn’s abduction, during the day, our family and friends were busy doing everything we could to raise awareness and handing out missing person flyers at major road intersections, posting them in businesses, and going door to door in the neighborhoods near Jenn’s condo. We were encouraged daily by people who came to help a family in need, a family they didn’t know.

Most nights, I was exhausted physically and emotionally, lying in bed trying to fall asleep, but my mind would not turn off. Thoughts bounced from trying to make sense of what happened to Jennifer to my marriage, business, and kids. Those nights were filled with tears, as my emotions were on hyperdrive, trying to process everything that was happening.

JENNIFER KESSE DISAPPEARANCE: POLICE PHOTOS SUGGEST VIOLENT STRUGGLE

Those restless nights felt more like a wrestling match with my past while being confronted with the brutal facts of my present reality. Facing reality is painful, but I would learn that it is also beneficial, restorative, and transformative if embraced.

I began crying out to God, which in itself is puzzling since I had walked away from church when I was 14 years old. It has been said that pain is God’s megaphone, and it turns out to be true. He now had my undivided attention. I was approaching my 50th birthday in May 2006 and facing the most desperate and challenging crisis in my life with nowhere to go and no one to turn to but God.

I bared my heart and soul to Him, just like I would with my best friends. For the first time in my life, I acknowledged how out of control my life was while feeling powerless to fix the mess I had created. I was forced to confront the truth about my life in a different way, in a way I would never have chosen.

Every night I prayed desperately for Jennifer to be brought home safely, to have the life she deserved. In those moments, I asked God to take my life so that Jenn could have hers back.

I had hit rock bottom. One night, I remember experiencing a sense of peace during my conversations with God that defied my current circumstances. It felt odd, bizarre. How could this be? How do I have peace when everything in and around me is in turmoil? What did this all mean?

ROBERT JEFFRESS: DON’T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF PRAYER, NO MATTER WHAT OTHERS SAY

Pain is indeed a megaphone. I opened my heart to hear what God was saying and embraced a new life He offered. By His grace, I was inspired to write a book, ""Aftermath of Jennifer Kesse’s Abduction: An Uncle’s Inspiring Journey and Other Stories of Hope.""

In the book, I share my 16-year journey of life transformation, from selfish to selfless, authentically and vulnerably, and introduce readers to inspirational stories of people who overcame unimaginable obstacles.

Inspired hope is not wishful thinking but a confident expectation only found in one person through an intimate relationship that lasts our lifetime. This hope is anchored to a person and a promise - the person of Jesus and the promise - that if you believe in Jesus, you will have life; an authentic and meaningful life resulting from being rescued, redeemed, and restored to a right relationship with God that will positively impact all the relationships in your life.

I need that confident hope and thankfully God gave the strength and patience to persevere over the past 16 plus years. I knew I wasn’t the person I wanted to be, nor was I the husband and father my family deserved.

The road I traveled included some rocky paths, some slippery slopes, and some uncomfortable terrain that was my life and relationships at that time. As I pursued my new life and preferred future, some of the people in my life may not be happy, it made them uncomfortable. Some believed it was my latest fad. Over time it became obvious it was not.

Thankfully, my wife and family never gave up on me, and most people in my life encouraged and cheer me on to finish strong.

If you would like to change the narrative direction of your life, I found the best place to start is with ourselves. Having focused on becoming the person I wished other people were, I was transformed into a better version of myself, and honestly, I cringe thinking about my old self. Know that I will be cheering you on so that you finish strong!

I do have one request -- that you keep my sister Joyce, my brother-in-law, Drew, and my nephew Logan and his family in your prayers because as of the date of this writing, Jennifer is still missing, vanished without a trace.

One of my objectives for writing this book is that the person or people who were involved in Jennifer’s abduction would know that no matter what they have done, the final chapter of their life stories has not been written. They can come forward with information that will either bring Jenn home or bring closure to our family. Facing the truth does, in fact, set you free, and a new life is waiting to begin.

The head of the Anglican Communion attempted to reinforce the church's stance against homosexual marriage this week, but the move was squashed by outcry from various bishops.

The controversy came to a head during the ongoing 2022 Lambeth Conference — a rare meeting of Anglican Communion bishops from around the world.

The Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches (GSFA) — self-described as ""a worldwide fellowship of orthodox Anglican Provinces and Dioceses within the Anglican Communion"" — came to the conference with the gay marriage ban firmly on their agenda.

""We often feel that our voices are not listened to, or respected,"" South Sudanese Primate Rev. Justin Badi told The Church Times. ""Today, in Canterbury, we may be ‘gathered together’, but we most certainly cannot ‘walk together’ until Provinces which have gone against scripture — and the will of the consensus of the bishops — repent and return to orthodoxy.""

QUEEN ELIZABETH SNUBS PRINCE HARRY, PRAISES PRINCES CHARLES, WILLIAM FOR HONORING PRINCE PHILLIP'S CLIMATE WORK

He continued, ""The Communion is not in a healthy condition at present, and only major surgery will put that right.""

They were bolstered in private, if not publicly, by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. The archbishop, by the nature of his office, is the most senior cleric in the Anglican Communion but holds limited powers of governance on his own.

POPE FRANCIS WARNS GERMAN BISHOPS: CHANGING TEACHINGS IS 'NOT LAWFUL,' CAUSES CHURCHES TO 'ROT AND DIE'

Welby met with the GSFA in private on July 29 and offered to write a letter backing the traditional view of marriage, according to Anglican Church journalist George Conger. A call was scheduled for the conference — a sort of vote amongst the bishops to endorse or abandon proposed belief statements.

The next day — after word got out about the push for a formal rejection of homosexual marriage — the conference was threatened with chaos.

Many bishops reportedly stayed seated and did not receive the Eucharist during the mass. Protests against recording votes on church calls arose, and eventually, the conference ceased keeping track of individual bishops' decisions.

The call to reinforce Lambeth 1.10 was eventually dropped.

However, there was no demonstration against the archbishop nor the conference, and proceedings continued.

Despite the fervor, Welby made good on his promised letter, released to the faithful on Tuesday.

""I wanted to write this letter to you now so that I can clarify two matters for all of us. Given the deep differences that exist within the Communion over same-sex marriage and human sexuality, I thought it important to set down what is the case,"" Welby wrote in his letter.

REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM AND THE BILLY GRAHAM EVANGELISTIC ASSOCIATION SHOW CHRISTIANS' STRUGGLES IN UKRAINE AMID WAR

He continued, ""I write therefore to affirm that the validity of the resolution passed at the Lambeth Conference 1998, 1:10 is not in doubt and that whole resolution is still in existence. Indeed the Call on Human Dignity made clear this is the case, as the resolution is quoted from three times in the paragraph 2.3 of the Call on Human Dignity.""

The archbishop went on to point out that the 1998 statues cited did not make mention of sanctions or exclusions based on obedience. Welby said that the ""Pain, anxiety, and contention"" caused by Lambeth 1.10 was ""very clear.""

He concluded, ""To be reconciled to one another across such divides is not something we can achieve by ourselves. That is why, as we continue to reflect on 1 Peter, I pray that we turn our gaze towards Christ who alone has the power to reconcile us to God and to one another.""

Anglicanism has been fracturing for decades over gay relationships, women's ordination and other issues. Those rifts blew wide open in 2003 when the New York-based Episcopal Church consecrated the first openly gay bishop, Gene Robinson, in New Hampshire.

The year prior, the top U.S. Episcopal legislative body, or General Convention, voted to authorize gay marriages in their churches.

Jury deliberations in the New Hampshire trial of a truck driver charged with killing seven motorcyclists began Tuesday after closing statements raised questions about who was more ""all over the place"": the trucker accused of swerving back and forth across the road or the eyewitnesses accused of contradicting each other.

Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, 26, of West Springfield, Massachusetts, faces negligent homicide, manslaughter and reckless conduct charges in connection with the June 21, 2019, crash that killed seven members of a Marine motorcycle club.

MASSACHUSETTS TRUCK DRIVER WHOSE CRASH KILLED 7 MOTORCYCLISTS APPEARS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TRIAL

Prosecutors have argued that Zhukovskyy, who had taken heroin, fentanyl and cocaine that day, repeatedly swerved back and forth before the head-on crash and told police he caused it. But a judge dismissed eight charges related to whether he was impaired, and his attorneys blame the lead biker, Albert ""Woody"" Mazza, who was among those killed.

""He was drunk, he was not looking where he was going, he lost control of his motorcycle and slid in front of Vlad Zhukovskyy’s truck. Al Mazza caused this accident. Vlad Zhukovskyy is not guilty,"" defense attorney Jay Duguay said in closing statements.

""There is no doubt that this accident was a tragedy,"" Duguay said. ""But we are not here to decide whether or not this was a tragedy.""

Duguay accused prosecutors of ignoring that their own accident reconstruction unit contradicted their theory that Zhukovskyy crossed into the oncoming lane. An expert hired by the defense, meanwhile, testified that the crash happened on the center line of the road and would have occurred even if the truck was in the middle of its lane because Mazza’s motorcycle was heading in that direction.

""From the beginning of this investigation, the state had made up their mind about what had happened, evidence be damned,"" said Duguay, who also highlighted inconsistencies between witness accounts or when witnesses contradicted themselves.

TRUCK DRIVER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE CRASH THAT KILLED 7 BIKERS WAS ON DRUGS, REPORT SAYS

""Those witnesses were all over the place about what they recalled and what they claimed to have seen,"" he said.

In particular, Duguay suggested that members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club ""shaded"" their accounts to protect Mazza and the club. Prosecutor Scott Chase acknowledged some inconsistencies but asked jurors to remember the circumstances.

""People were covering the dead, trying to save the barely living, comforting the dying. This wasn’t story time,"" he said. ""They were up here talking about some of the most unimaginable chaos, trauma, death and carnage that we can even imagine three years later. They were talking about hell broke open.""

Witnesses were consistent, he argued, in describing the truck as weaving back and forth before the crash. That behavior continued ""until he killed people,"" Chase said.

""That’s what stopped him. It’s not that he made some responsible decision to start paying attention or do the right thing,"" he said. ""The only thing that stopped him was an embankment after he tore through a group of motorcycles.""

Chase called the attempt to blame Mazza a ""fanciful story"" and ""frivolous distraction,"" while reminding jurors that Zhukovskyy, who didn’t testify at trial, told investigators, ""Obviously, I caused the crash.""

""He was crystal clear from the very beginning that he caused this crash,"" Chase said. ""That is what he said because that is what happened.""

The motorcyclists who died were from New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island and ranged in age from 42 to 62. They were part of a larger group that had just left a motel along U.S. Route 2 in Randolph.

A Missouri man has been charged with shooting and killing his neighbor following an argument over lawn mowing, bringing to an end years of hostility between the two, officials said.

Samuel Avery, 42, of Kansas City, was charged Monday with second-degree murder and armed criminal action in the killing of 41-year-old Warner Trotter, who was shot in his head on his front porch, the Jackson County Prosecutor's office said. Trotter was declared dead at hospital.

According to court documents, Avery called police on Sunday to report that he had shot his neighbor. Officers found Avery on his porch next door and arrested him without incident.

Police said officers had been called to the men's homes twice previously because they were arguing over Avery mowing his lawn too early in the day. No one was arrested during those incidents. According to a probable cause statement, Avery told investigators they had been arguing for 10 years.

On the day of the shooting, Trotter complained that Avery's lawn mower was too loud and made a gesture with his hand that he would shoot Avery, according to court documents. Avery said he called the police and was told nothing could be done, then Trotter waved an actual gun around and said nothing would happen to him.

Then she heard several shots.

Avery told police that Trotter reached for a gun before Avery started firing his weapon, according to records.

Kellogg's cereal company is the largest cereal distributor in the United States with its origins dating back to the late 19th century.

Corn flakes were Kellogg's company's first product that made them the king of cereal and a huge player in the American breakfast market. Will and John Kellogg created the product together in order to create a digestible yet affordable breakfast meal for middle Americans. During this period, many Americans had digestible issues due to the limited number of dietary options for middle-class Americans.

Together the Kellogg brothers promoted their new product as a ""nutritious and healthful"" breakfast option, but a disagreement over whether a small detail led to them splitting apart and the creation of the Kellogg cereal company.

Why was Corn Flakes invented?

John Kellogg, and his brother, Will, invented corn flakes for patients at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in 1894. The patients enjoyed the cereal, and two years later, a patent for the recipe was granted in 1896. The two brothers eventually went their separate ways after disagreeing over whether to add sugar to the cereal.

By the 20th century, Kellogg's Cereal Company cereal was marketed for its daily health benefits and as an easily digestible meal. They also emphasize the sweet flavor of the flakes and their ""dainty crispness."" During this time, indigestion was a big concern for Americans with sensitive stomachs, especially because morning dining options were limited.

Moreover, the cereal was also invented to align with the dietary restrictions of the Seventh Day Adventist church attended by the Kellogg family.

Are corn flakes good for you?

Corn flakes were created as a healthy and easily digestible cereal that would appeal to a broad demographic of Americans. However, corn flakes like any other cereal are low in fiber even when eaten with low-fat milk, so they are not the healthiest option for a balanced breakfast. If you do eat cornflakes the healthiest option would be to combine them with a piece of fruit or snack.

What is in corn flakes?

Kellogg's is suitable for vegans due to the ingredients that make up the golden flakes which are sugar, salt, barley malt extract, and vitamin E. Approximately 90% of the context is made out of corn.

A major point of disagreement between the Kellogg brothers was over the inclusion of sugar in the product because John did not want any traces of sugar in corn flakes while his brother Will believed it would attract more customers."

An 80-year-old Washington state woman was permanently banned from her local YMCA pool after demanding that a transgender employee leave the women’s locker room, she told local media.

""I saw a man in a woman’s bathing suit watching maybe four or five little girls pulling down their suits in order to use the toilet,"" Port Townsend resident Julie Jaman recalled of the July incident to Seattle radio show host Dori Monson on Friday. ""I asked if he had a penis and he said it was none of my business. I told that man to ‘get out right now.’""

The incident occurred on July 26 at the Mountain View pool, which is a City of Port Townsend facility operated by the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, according to local news outlet Port Townsend Free Press.

Jaman said that she was alerted to the trans employee being in the women’s locker room while she was showering and ""heard a man’s voice.""

She told Monson that she alerted a pool staffer to the incident and was stunned when the staff member told her she was ""being discriminatory,"" and ""was banned from the pool forever."" The staffer also allegedly said the police would be called, according to Jaman’s radio interview.

""She didn’t ask me what the problem was, if I was okay, nothing about me,"" Jaman told Monson. ""It’s as if she was just waiting to pounce on me. It was just stunning.""

The Port Townsend Police Department told Fox News Digital that no official police report was filed, but the department provided an incident report on the matter.

The incident report details that Jaman ""had an emotional response to a strange male being in the bathroom"" near young girls, and is hoping to not be ""trespassed"" from the pool, according to a phone call an officer had with Jaman. The report also noted a phone call from the YMCA detailing that Jaman was reportedly in the facility’s locker room ""screaming"" at an employee and ""refusing to leave.""

Erin Hawkins, the marketing & communications manager for the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, told Fox News Digital that the permanent pool ban followed a build-up of incidents where Jaman violated the facility’s code of conduct. She said the permanent suspension was not solely due to the singular incident in the women's locker room last month.

""Julie Jaman was permanently suspended from the Mountain View Pool due to her repeatedly violating our Code of Conduct, specifically, using disrespectful words or gestures toward YMCA staff or others; abusive, harassing and/or obscene language or gestures toward YMCA staff or others,"" Hawkins said in comment to Fox News Digital on Monday.

Jaman told local media that she had been a member of the pool facility for 35 years and has lived in Port Townsend for about 40 years. She has voted for Democrats during her life, she told the local outlet, and considers herself an ""XX woman,"" referring to her chromosomes.

She added to the Port Townsend Free Press that she recoiled at being naked and showering in a room with a person born male. She added that the ""momma bear in me"" came out when she saw the individual near the young girls in the bathroom.

Jaman added that she also spoke with the CEO of the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, Wendy Bart, and said that she told Bart there should be warnings that the bathrooms were also used by trans individuals.

​​""I told her there were no signs posted to give women warning,"" Jaman told Monson. ""She said there were Pride posters posted all over and she assumed that was adequate to inform women what to expect."" Bart also said, ""‘we take pride and everyone is welcome,’"" according to Jaman’s description of the conversation.

""That’s fine with me, except that they do not provide alternatives for women who choose not to be undressing in front of men,"" Jaman continued in the radio interview. ""Our pool is a very old pool. We just have two shower rooms, dressing rooms, one for men, one for women.""

One veteran is still fighting for America — and for himself.

Brandon Rumbaugh appeared on ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" on Sunday morning to share his story of staying fit after his military service — and after becoming a double amputee.

What's clear is that his toughness and strength are continuing to keep him healthy in every way — something others can do as well, no matter their circumstances, especially with him and others as inspiration.

Rumbaugh lost both legs during his service in Afghanistan — he was actually at the hospital together with Johnny Joey Jones, Fox News contributor.

He said that the two of them have come so far in terms of their recovery and their fitness levels. That ""makes me happy,"" he said.

CrossFit helped him with his journey to recovery, he said.

""Those same women run The Fund today, alongside other spouses and retired service members from all service branches.""

The group has helped over 28,000 veterans around the country, Rumbaugh emphasized.

""If you just put your mind to it and get in there and do it, we can accomplish anything.""

He said, ""It's crazy. There are vets [out there] today that don't know about us"" — and they need to, he said, so that they can get the help and support they deserve.

He said that going to the group's website, TheFund.org, ""is the easiest way to learn about us,"" he said. Anyone can donate as well to help America's vets.

""Being able to go to the gym and let out some of [the] frustration, some of that aggression … If you just put your mind to it and get in there and do it, we can accomplish anything,"" he added.

He then ran through some key presses with kettlebells with the ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" co-hosts on Sunday, July 31, 2022.

They worked not only on muscle development, but also on their abs.

""Everything is circuit-based,"" he said about CrossFit.

Getting more exercise could be linked to a longer life.

A new 12-page research article published in the American Heart Association’s Circulation Journal found that people who got extra exercise had a lower mortality rate compared to those who did not.

The study, which was conducted by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, was published on Monday, July 25.

Over a 30-year period from 1988 to 2018, a total of 116,221 adults were monitored and submitted exercise reports that detailed their ""leisure-time physical activity.""

HOW TO EXERCISE DURING A WORK TRIP AND STAY FIT WHILE TRAVELING

Mortality reduction was observed in study participants who got 150 to 300 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week and 300 to 600 minutes of moderate physical activity.

Vigorous exercisers who participated in activities like jogging, running, climbing stairs, swimming, bicycling, aerobics, playing sports and working outdoors for 150 to 299 minutes, had a lower mortality rate between 21% and 23% for all causes of death.

This exercise group also had lower cardiovascular deaths between 27% and 33% and lower non-cardiovascular deaths by 19%. People who exercised vigorously for more than 300 minutes per week ""did not have further lower mortality,"" according to the study.

Moderate exercisers, on the other hand, who participated in activities like walking, weightlifting performing lower-intensity workouts and calisthenics for 150 to 299 minutes, had a lower mortality rate between 20% and 21% for all causes of death.

In terms of cardiovascular deaths, moderate exercisers had a 22% to 25% lower chance, and for non-cardiovascular deaths, moderate exercisers had a 19% to 20% lower chance.

People who exercised moderately for 300 to 599 minutes per week had ""3% to 13% further lower mortality,"" according to the study.

Researchers behind the study documented 47,596 deaths during its observation.

""The nearly maximum association with lower mortality was achieved by performing ≈150 to 300 min/wk of long-term leisure-time [vigorous physical activity], 300 to 600 min/wk of long-term leisure-time [moderate physical activity], or an equivalent combination of both,"" the team wrote in the study’s conclusion.

However, the study’s participants were pulled from surveys collected by the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which may have skewed results.

Most of the study participants were in their 60s, had a normal BMI, rarely ate more than 2,000 calories per day, drank alcohol occasionally and hardly smoked.

There was a lack of racial diversity as well with more than 90% of study participants being White.

If you’re traveling for work these days, make sure to keep your fitness goals in mind.

Your itinerary could include early-morning sales calls, late-day business meetings — and also long lunches, late-night meals entertaining clients and even follow-up work at night in your hotel room.

Research from the American Council on Exercise says that exercise increases alertness and productivity and also boosts moods — which can create a better mindset for business travel.

CAREER CHALLENGE: SHOULD YOU SOCIALIZE WITH YOUR BOSS OUTSIDE OF THE WORKPLACE?

While you’re traveling, fitness experts say you don’t need fancy gyms, pricey equipment or an abundance of free time to incorporate fitness into your business travel schedule. To make sure get some exercise in while you're away, try these smart tips.

1. Use the hotel's amenities if you can

Aim for a hotel with a gym, a pool and one that’s in a pedestrian-friendly location.

You can swim laps in the pool, use cardio equipment and do weight-training in the fitness center and walk around the area where your hotel is located.

As a fitness professional who travels to certify trainers around the country, Cary Williams, CEO of Boxing & Barbells in Santa Monica, California, said she does her best to book a hotel with a gym when she’s traveling.

However, if you can’t find a hotel that offers all these amenities — don’t worry.

THESE ARE THE BEST FOODS FOR YOUR HEART, EXPERTS SAY

""If there is not a gym or the gym is closed, there are plenty of exercises you can do in your room without equipment,"" Williams said.

Also, to get your steps in, skip the elevator and use the stairs, she advised.

2. Do an in-room workout

The best plan, said Williams, is to set your alarm an hour earlier while out of town so that you have at least a good 30-45 minutes to get in a workout.

She recommends an interval type of workout with about six exercises: three body weight exercises and three cardio-types of exercises.

""Find a timer app on your phone and set it for 45 seconds of work time and 15 second rest time between exercises,"" she said.

Williams curated an example of a room workout. She said each of the following exercises should take six minutes (aim for five rounds): squats; knee ups (high knees in place); push-ups; jumping rope (bring you own); lunges; and sit-ups.

You can add some weights to your workout if you have your own — or you can use dumbbells from the hotel’s gym.

3. Explore your surroundings

Chelsea Cohen, co-founder of SoStocked, in Austin, Texas, said fitness is a vital part of her daily routine. When she is traveling for work, her goal is to ensure the same.

""Exploring keeps me fit,"" said Cohen. ""Each business trip comes with a new opportunity to explore and indulge in exciting activities.""

She added, ""Whenever I’m in a new city, I make sure that I walk around a bit whether it’s for shopping or finding a good restaurant.""

Cohen said she prioritizes taking a walking path to her work meetings.

""This helps keep my body in motion,"" she said. ""The best thing is that walking keeps my mind off the usual workouts and gives me the much-needed exercise without needing to carve extra time for it.""

Outside work meetings, pack a pair of sneakers and walk the area to learn about the new city and explore.

4. Embrace technology

As CEO of Brooklyn, NY-based MediaPeanut, Victoria Mendoza said she frequently travels for business; technology has helped keep her on track in terms of her fitness and health.

""I have recently learned to incorporate technology into my own fitness regimen,"" she said.

She uses several apps to help her with calorie counting, measuring calories burned during exercise and daily activities — and also measuring her daily steps and monitoring her exercise activities.

""Some of these popular apps are Fooducate, Strides, MyFitnessPal and Fitbit aside from the health trackers in my phone,"" she added.

""Setting aside an hour for a virtual fitness trainer session allows me to not stray from my fitness goals and correctly do my workouts, even with limited machines.""

Also, Mendoza said she’s hired virtual fitness trainers who monitor her fitness activities and plan her workouts at least twice or three times a week, even while she travels for work.

""Setting aside an hour for a virtual fitness trainer session allows me to not stray from my fitness goals and correctly do my workouts, even with limited machines."" She said the virtual trainers come up with ""exercise plans depending on the location and time and space that I have at my disposal.""

5. Cycle your way to health

Jarelle Parker, a Silicon Valley personal trainer in Menlo Park, California, suggested booking a bike tour around a new city.

""This is a great way to meet people and to be adventurous by exploring a new environment,"" she said. ""It's also a great way to incorporate fitness into your travel.""

She mentioned that Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, New York and San Diego ""have amazing bike tours for fitness travelers.""

If indoor cycling is more the preference (along with others to help motivate you), Parker noted that the ClassPass app can help.

Ella Halikas has gone viral for recreating some of Julia Fox’s most daring looks – but for the SI Swimsuit model, it was a no-brainer.

""I remember she was wearing the low-rise look, and I was like, ‘Ooh, the low-rise is coming back,’"" the 24-year-old chuckled to Fox News Digital. ""And I remember people who were a lot curvier were scared of that. I would come across videos on TikTok of girls saying, ‘There’s no way I’m participating in this trend. I don’t have the right body.’ My first thought was, ‘Why not?’ Obviously, we have different body types, but I also love to showcase my body. And I thought if I could wear this, someone else might feel they can too. We can feel just as confident and beautiful together. I wanted to start that conversation.""

The curve model took to Instagram where she posted side-by-side photos of herself and Fox, 32, wearing similar looks. Some pieces Halikas wore included black and white Calvin Klein underwear while grocery shopping, as well as a cropped white tank top and a mini skirt paired with black patent gloves and boots – two recognizable styles from the fellow model.

Halikas said she received an overwhelming amount of support after the photos went viral.

""I wanted to show people you can rock whatever you want, you can feel just as confident and beautiful,"" the California native shared. ""I wanted other girls to be seen. I wanted others to feel good in their skin and be encouraged to try wearing something they feel they could never wear. I’ve gotten such a great reaction from people, and they’re loving it. I mean, it takes time, effort and money to organize all these shoots that are unpaid. But it’s a great feeling to know it’s encouraging others to showcase their bodies.""

According to Halikas, she actually went to a grocery store in Beverly Hills to mimic Fox’s supermarket look.

""The secret to making Julia Fox’s look – or any look for that matter – your own is confidence,"" she explained. ""It’s not so much about body type. It’s about how you carry yourself. It’s not about how you look physically. It’s about how you feel mentally. You have to walk with your chest up high and feel good. When you see the photos, you have to feel the confidence, the energy. That’s what makes people go, ‘She looks good.’ If I had walked to that store all covered up and my chin down looking nervous, people would say, ‘That’s not flattering, put some clothes on. What are you doing?’ You have to own your body and you have to own your look. If you can have that mental shift and find that confidence, then you can pull off anything.""

Halikas said the ""Uncut Gems"" star has not reached out to her personally after the photos went viral, but she has seen them.

""She would look at my Stories [on Instagram],"" Halikas explained. ""She liked both of my posts. She’s just never commented or personally reach out… But this isn’t really about mimicking a celebrity or about Julia Fox personally. It’s more about recreating a style and showing it on a different body type. I would love to start doing different celebrities and other thinner women like Bella Hadid. ""

The star first made a splash in 2021 when she was photographed by veteran photographer Yu Tsai in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for SI Swimsuit. Halikas, who has been inspired by Ashley Graham and Hunter McGrady, said it has always been a dream of hers to appear in the magazine.

""The shoot just felt like a dream,"" she recalled. ""I even connected with Ashley Graham. She sent me a voice message the morning of my shoot. I remember she said, ‘I’m so proud of you, you should be proud of yourself. You’ve come so far.’ I just started crying. I stayed up late the night before my shoot watching videos of her modeling on YouTube to get some inspiration. So I couldn’t believe my role model was cheering me on. I felt empowered. What I love about this brand is that the girls are so uplifting and encouraging. You couldn’t find a more supportive sisterhood.""

""I remember when the magazine finally came out, I was searching all around San Francisco where I was for a shoot, going to every Walgreens, CVS, library, Barnes & Noble,"" Halikas continued. ""I couldn’t find it anywhere. After hours of searching, I had to go to the airport and get on a flight to Miami. I went to a newsstand there and saw it on the wall. I immediately grabbed it. I got a full page in the issue… I was so proud that I made it that far.""

Today, Halikas hopes that her body will serve as an inspiration to other women who ""deserve to be seen"" in the fashion industry.

""It’s been super important for me to talk about the difference between body positivity and body neutrality,"" she explained. ""Body positivity is when you accept your body, not really wanting to change it. Body neutrality means you love your body, but you’re OK with change too. I’m more neutral. I love my body, and I’m very positive about it, but there are things that I believe can make me stronger. I’m always looking to be the best version of myself… I enjoy working out and for me, it’s way more than just trying to lose weight. I’m not even thinking about weight or needing to lose. I’m thinking, ‘How can I get more toned? How can I feel healthier? How can I help my anxiety? How can I improve my mental health?’""

The model shared that she relies on consistent Pilates and weight-lifting to challenge herself, all while improving her mental health. She is also an avid fan of soccer, hot yoga and the occasional jog.

""The advice I would give to anyone who is intimidated by the gym is that nobody in there is worried about you,"" she advised. ""They’re more into themselves. In life, we always think people are looking at us and judging, whether it’s when we’re wearing a new outfit or at the gym. Most people, especially nowadays, are just so concerned with themselves. If you’re intimidated, get a workout buddy or meet with a trainer. If the weight room looks scary because it’s just a bunch of guys, hop on a treadmill. You can also go to a room alone and do some cardio. I also go to a Pilates class, and I’m probably the biggest girl there… but in a way, it empowers me. I’m thinking, ‘Yeah, I’m twice your size, but look what I can do.’ Health and fitness look different in every single body. I’m all about feeling strong to be my best self.""

""More importantly, don’t compare yourself to others, especially when everyone is out right now wearing a bikini,"" she said. ""There’s so much power in just being you. You are unique. Don’t lose sight of that. It’s easier said than done, but it’s not fun comparing yourself to everyone else. Embrace who you are and what you’re capable of."""

Christie Brinkley made a splash in 2017 when, at age 63, she posed alongside her daughters, Alexa Ray Joel and Sailor Brinkley Cook, for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit.

It wasn’t the first time for the model, who first covered the magazine in 1979 and then set a record by landing the covers for the next two years. But this time, the star was having second thoughts.

Brinkley told the August/September 2022 issue of Long Island Woman that the opportunity ""came about suddenly.""

""I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to do it,"" the 68-year-old admitted to the outlet. ""But I did really want my girls to have that experience so we said OK.""

The shoot took place at their family home in Turks and Caicos. While Brinkley has led a successful career being in the spotlight, she still faced some insecurities posing once more in bikinis.

""The second you start thinking about being in ‘Sports Illustrated’ you start thinking about, ‘Oh, do we stack up?’"" Brinkley explained. ""Everybody gets a little insecure. It was kind of interesting for everybody to be together there and sort of address their insecurities and get it out there.""

""My girls have both had different fears having grown up in front of the scrutiny of the press, so I think it was fraught with a little bit of anxiety,"" she continued. ""But it was cathartic, I think. Everybody enjoyed the moment and having that experience together.""

Brinkley noted that having a positive outlook on life has been essential over the years.

""I’ve always been of the school of, ‘You just got to be grateful for whatever you got. You’ve got two arms, two legs, two eyes,’"" she said. ""It’s silly to stress about anything else. Be grateful. So what if it’s five pounds up, it’s you and it’s all good.""

These days, Brinkley is grateful that the modeling industry has become more inclusive over the years.

""The most beautiful thing about this beauty industry is that its arms are wide open trying to make sure that they embrace and celebrate every size, shape, age, race,"" she said. ""And that they see themselves and find themselves on the pages and feel good about themselves.""

While it’s been ""a great movement,"" Brinkley said there's more work to be done.

CHRISTIE BRINKLEY SAYS SHE’LL ‘NEVER’ USE DATING APPS TO FIND ROMANCE: ‘THE LOVE OF MY LIFE IS MY LIFE’

""I would still like to see more women my age in magazines because women say to me on my Instagram account all the time, 'I’m so happy when I see your full outfit. Because sometimes I don’t know what’s OK to wear,'"" she said. ""And I try and give people the message that, if you feel good in it, then it’s OK.""

Back in April 2021, Brinkley told Fox News Digital she hoped her latest swimsuit snaps, which often go viral, will inspire other women to celebrate themselves — no matter their age.

""I post these pictures because I hear from women my age all the time that say, ‘Thank you for changing the way people think about the numbers,’"" Brinkley said at the time. ""Back in the day, numbers represented something. I remember people thinking that after 30, you should never wear your hair past your shoulders or your hemline needed to hover your knee caps.""

""I’ve always found those rules so limiting,"" she said. ""Everybody’s different, everybody’s unique. But it’s like telling a gymnast she can’t do flips past a certain age. It doesn’t make sense. If you’ve got great legs, show them. If there’s something about yourself that you really love, celebrate that. Don’t be controlled by those numbers.""

Kelly Hughes made history this summer when she became the first model to bare her cesarean-section scar for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition in the magazine's 58-year history.

The outlet partnered with Frida Mom to raise awareness of Pay With Change, an initiative aimed to ""positively shift the mainstream cultural narratives associated with women’s bodies – especially when becoming a mom.""

The proud model and mom wore a nude-hued skimpy string bikini for the 2022 issue which features Kim Kardashian, Maye Musk, Ciara and Yumi Nu as this year’s cover girls.

Hughes delivered her now 3-year-old son via cesarean. She joins Katrina Scott, 2021’s Rookie of the Year, who was photographed when she was six and a half months pregnant, as well as Hunter McGrady, who posed for the outlet six months postpartum.

SI SWIMSUIT ISSUE MAKES HISTORY WITH MODEL KELLY HUGHES BARING C-SECTION SCAR: ‘OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME’

After Hughes' photo went viral, the founder and designer of the jewelry brand HÜES partnered with ESTAS Beauty to start the #ScarLoveChallenge on social media to spread a feeling of empowerment and change the societal stigma around scars. The challenge encourages participants to reinterpret Hughes' photo showing off their scars. Every time a #ScarLoveChallenge photo is posted, ESTAS will donate $1 to World of Children, helping disadvantaged children around the globe.

Hughes spoke to Fox News Digital about the struggles she endured during labor, the insecurities she faced after giving birth, as well as how she now responds to negative comments on Instagram.

Fox News: How did you get involved with SI Swimsuit?

Kelly Hughes: One of my friends in New York, who is also a model, saw that they were looking for a girl with a C-section scar, and they were shooting in the Florida Keys, which is close to me as I’m in Miami. I reached out to my agency, they proposed me and that’s how I got the job. It’s so wonderful because my friend is also a mother. And without her, I wouldn’t have gotten this opportunity. So it’s beautiful to see one mother supporting another mother.

Fox News: Take us back to your shoot. What was that like?

Hughes: I had a million things running through my mind before I even started shooting. I had never shown my scar before. And I have been really open with how I struggled with insecurities around my scar. I originally didn’t want a C-section because the bounce back was going to be much harder being that I’m a model.

Society just puts so much pressure on you to ""bounce back."" I wasn’t a size two anymore. I wasn’t doing too much modeling in a bikini in the first place. So it was scary at first to show my biggest insecurity in a magazine like Sports Illustrated. I wasn’t sure how I was going to be received.

Fox News: How were you received on set?

Hughes: As soon as I arrived, the editor just made me feel so confident and beautiful. She turned my insecurity into the most beautiful thing in the world. She just made me feel so much better about my scar. I felt so much more confident about myself. I just looked at my scar in the mirror and I realized I shouldn’t have to feel so insecure about this anymore. And when it was time to shoot, everyone reacted the same way. They made me feel so empowered and inspired. I imagine how many beautiful women they’ve seen, and now I get to be part of that representation. The experience was a healing one for me. It just really helped me to overcome my insecurities.

Fox News: How important was it for you to show off your C-section scar despite your insecurities?

Hughes: To be honest, I had no idea how much this would impact people. But my photo went viral all over the world. This is something I probably wouldn’t have done before, but I also didn’t see myself in the same way I see myself now. And I think it’s beautiful that a magazine like Sports Illustrated is showing a woman with a C-section and saying, ""she’s beautiful."" Now, I realize how important that photo is to me because I had no idea how underrepresented this was.

Apparently, one in three women are having C-sections now – that’s a large number of women. But this doesn’t just resonate with women who have C-sections. This also resonates with women who have scars in general and are insecure about them. The fashion industry has evolved, and they’re finally starting to embrace different women. We don’t have to all look the same. So this photo represents so much more than a C-section scar… I feel a true responsibility to continue this conversation.

FITNESS ICON DENISE AUSTIN, 65, AND DAUGHTER KATIE MODEL BIKINIS FOR SI SWIMSUIT RUNWAY SHOW: ‘PROUD MAMA’

Fox News: What went through your mind when you saw your photo for the first time?

Hughes: I just kept saying ""wow"" *laughs*. I will never forget that moment. We shot with six different bathing suits that day to have options. And for some reason, the moment I shot that picture, I just knew it was going to be chosen. It just shows pure joy. And I think that’s what we should feel when we look at our scars. It represents we overcame something difficult, and we’re here.

You know in the fashion industry, nobody wants to show cellulite. Nobody wants to show scars. But these things are normal, and they should be normalized. And when you see my photo, you just see pure joy. I was so insecure about my scar, but it also represents the most beautiful moment of my life because my son was born. So I should feel joy.

Fox News: Some critics have said, ""SI Swimsuit is a magazine of women in bikinis. Do we really need to see this?"" What would you tell those people?

Hughes: It’s interesting, I was shocked that about 99% of people that reached out to me have been supportive. Even the press I received after my photo went viral was supportive. Sure, sometimes people like to make their comments – it is Instagram – but I’ve gotten an overwhelming number of positive comments from both men and women. Of course, you still get comments like ""who cares?"" or ""she’s half-naked"" or ""we don’t want to see this"" – all those comments are generic. And the truth is, there will always be people out there who want to dim your light.

All I can say is I don’t understand how someone can make negative comments, especially on someone’s social media posts. There’s no need for it. You don’t gain anything from that. But the overwhelming amount of positive comments from people proves that something like this was needed. This is about representation. Think about those mothers out there with C-section scars wearing a bikini at the beach. Sometimes it peeks out.

SI SWIM MODEL VICTORIA VESCE RECALLS OVERCOMING ‘NIGHTMARE’ BRAIN TUMOR: ‘I HAD EVERY SYMPTOM IN THE BOOK’

I’ve received so many messages from women telling me they’ve felt so insecure going to the beach that they buy a bigger bikini or just choose to wear a one-piece to avoid the scrutiny. They go out of their way to not show the scar because they’re insecure about it. They’re worried about what people may say or think. Now, Sports Illustrated is having that conversation. It was so needed. You shouldn’t need to accommodate everyone else just so they can feel better. You’re so much more than any negative comment someone may have to say.

Now, I’m getting messages from women telling me how empowered they feel, and how confident they feel to wear that bikini again after having a baby. I hope that when people see my photo, they’ll feel encouraged to embrace themselves and give themselves grace. I look at my scar now, and I’m proud of what I went through. I embrace it. I’m still here. And that’s exactly what my photo shows. I just hope it can encourage others to feel the same.

Fox News: In 2018 you became a mom. But it sounded like you endured some challenges. What happened?

Hughes: My son was born in November 2018. During my pregnancy, I had nausea and all the typical things, but it wasn’t anything severe. I had a good pregnancy and I thought I was going to have a natural labor. I have read everything about natural labor, and I was ready for it. I never opened the door to the possibility of a C-section. I just wanted to bounce back as quickly as possible. I knew a C-section meant a longer recovery. But when I was in labor, unfortunately [the doctors] realized that my hips weren’t aligned. They were a bit shifted, which happens a lot in pregnancy. I didn’t realize this until it was time.

I had a very long labor – I was about 36 hours in, and I wasn’t dilating past seven centimeters. That’s when they recommended a C-section. At first, I was like, ""no, no, no."" But that was my first lesson in motherhood – you can’t plan for everything. I didn’t want to put my son’s health at risk or of course, my own. So I finally agreed. But two days later after I went home, I became really sick. I went back to the hospital, and it turned out I had a really bad infection. I spent eight days in the hospital and I underwent another surgery to remove the infection. Being separated from my son was so difficult. I wasn’t in the maternity unit anymore, and they didn’t want him in the hospital.

SI SWIM SEARCH FINALIST KRISTEN LOUELLE GAFFNEY, MOM OF TWO, UNVEILS CURVES ON MIAMI RUNWAY: 'MAGICAL MOMENT'

I just felt horrible. Like why did this happen to me? What did I do wrong? New moms especially, we put a lot of pressure on ourselves because we just want everything to be perfect. And the truth is, I don’t think this is discussed enough. There needs to be more conversations and education on all the million things that can happen during labor. But the most important thing is for mom and baby to be healthy. I wanted this perfect, natural birth to happen. It didn’t – and that’s OK. My son is here and so am I.

Fox News: After you gave birth and were recovering, did you still feel pressure to ""bounce back"" or look a certain way?

Hughes: I wish I could tell you that pressure went away I gave birth. It definitely didn’t. And I’m very honest about this… I’ve been modeling for 22 years. I have seen the fashion industry evolve in the last year and a half. But that shift hadn’t happened when I gave birth in November 2018. I did feel that pushback when I tried going back to work. I didn’t look the same as I did before. I certainly didn’t have the confidence.

I was very insecure. And I don’t think I was fully embraced quite yet. As a mom, you don’t always have time to go to the gym. Sometimes you don’t have time at all. And eating became whatever was in the house or whatever I could grab quickly, so I could get back to my son. My diet had changed. My routine had changed. The demands of my life had changed. But the truth is, once you give birth to a new person, you are not the same. So you shouldn’t feel pressure to be the same as you were before… It took time to finally embrace my scar and that’s OK. I no longer feel like I should be ashamed of it.

Fox News: What’s motherhood like today?

Hughes: It’s a blessing. I’m still modeling. My son and I did a photo shoot together for a company that offers clothing for breastfeeding moms. He was two months old. It was a little difficult because I wasn’t fully healed. I was still recovering from two surgeries. But it was an amazing experience. We’ve done quite a few photo shoots with him, and it’s been wonderful being with my son. He’s now three and a half, and it’s incredible.

The funds will help the groups produce videos, graphics and other information resources for distribution to the media and at community centers, bars, nightclubs, parties and events.

Torrian Baskerville, director of HIV and Health Equity at HRC, said the U.S. response to the virus at federal, state and local levels has been ""slow across the board.""

Policy changes are urgently needed to streamline the distribution of vaccines, with current systems varying among states, he said.

NMAC - formerly the National Minority AIDS Coalition - will receive $500,000 to coordinate the coalition's public policy efforts.

WILL MONKEYPOX BECOME ANOTHER COVID OR HIV?

Another $3 million is reserved for emergency grants to smaller organizations worldwide. Already stretched thin by COVID-19, these groups may otherwise need to delay patients' usual care during monkeypox outbreaks, said Gilead spokesperson Korab Zuka."

Actor Ashton Kutcher recently disclosed his bout with an autoimmune condition that affected his hearing, vision and ability to walk.

Access Hollywood obtained footage of an interview from Monday night’s episode of National Geographic’s ""Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge,"" in which the actor spoke about a rare autoimmune disorder he developed not long ago called vasculitis.

The 44-year-old actor said in the interview, ""Two years ago, I had this weird, super-rare form of vasculitis, that, like, knocked out my vision, it knocked out my hearing, it knocked out, like, all my equilibrium,"" according to the Access Hollywood report.

ASHTON KUTCHER REVEALS VASCULITIS DIAGNOSIS, SAYS HE COULDN'T WALK, TALK OR HEAR

Kutcher also said in the interview, ""You don’t really appreciate it until it’s gone. Until you go, ‘I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to see again, I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to hear again, I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to walk again.’""

The Vasculitis Foundation says that ""vasculitis is a general term that refers to inflammation of the blood vessels.""

It notes as well, ""It is used to describe a family of nearly 20 rare diseases, characterized by narrowing, weakening or scarring of the blood vessels, which can restrict blood flow and damage vital organs and tissues.""

The disease can affect blood vessels such as arteries, capillaries and veins.

The Center for Vasculitis Care and Research at Cleveland Clinic said on its website that vasculitis is an autoimmune disease — in which the body mistakenly attacks its own healthy tissue — that contributes to inflammation of blood vessels.

Currently, researchers believe this inflammatory response may be triggered by infections, medications, environmental or genetic factors, allergic reactions or another disease process.

The disease can affect blood vessels such as arteries, capillaries and veins — and symptoms can range from mild to severe, and vary from person to person, the Cleveland Clinic experts said.

Symptoms also depend on the tissues and organs that are affected.

The actor said it took about a year for his senses to recover, according to the media report.

Rheumatologists said while some forms of vasculitis may improve on their own, others may require medical care throughout one’s life.

Treatment of the disease depends on the specific type of vasculitis and the areas/organs that are involved, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Treatment may include the use of corticosteroids — or, in some cases, medications that suppress the immune system.

Regardless of the severity, health experts said that early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important to avoid potentially life-threatening complications.

The actor said it took about a year for his senses to recover, according to the media report. ""I’m lucky to be alive,"" Kutcher said in the interview.

Scans of blood vessels and the heart, as well as tissue biopsies, may also be performed.

Common symptoms of the disease include the following list, according to the Ceveland Clinic.

Skin rashes

Fatigue

Weakness

Fever

Joint pains

Abdominal pain

Kidney problems (including dark or bloody urine)

Nerve problems (including numbness, weakness and pain)

Cough and/or shortness of breath

Also, other symptoms can occur, depending on the area of the body affected by vasculitis.

The Cleveland experts noted that if a small blood vessel is affected, it might break, producing small areas of bleeding in the tissue that appear as small red or purple dots on the skin.

They also noted a nodule or lump might be noticeable in the skin when a larger blood vessel close to the skin surface is inflamed.

A physician can diagnose vasculitis based on symptoms, a person’s medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests. Scans of blood vessels and the heart, as well as tissue biopsies, may also be performed, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Kutcher, who shares two children with his wife Mila Kunis — whom he met when they filmed their hit TV series, ""That '70s Show"" — spoke about overcoming challenges.

""The minute you start seeing your obstacles as things that are made for you, to give you what you need, and then life starts to get fun, right?"" Kutcher said in the Bear Grylls interview, according to Access Hollywood.

Italy opened its vaccination campaign against monkeypox on Monday as case numbers have increased at a time when health authorities are reporting vaccine shortages worldwide.

Italy has reported 545 cases of monkeypox, according to the health ministry. Its vaccination campaign has started more than a month after other countries that have seen higher numbers of cases, including the United States, Britain and Spain.

The first doses will be given at the Spallanzani hospital in Rome, the hospital said in a statement.

SPAIN CONFIRMS FIRST MONKEYPOX-RELATED DEATH IN EUROPE

Vaccines and treatments have been in short supply and the disease often left for historically underfunded sexual health clinics to manage.

Spallanzani said it already has 200 people who will be vaccinated from Monday onwards, as well as 600 requests for bookings.

The vaccine used will be Jynneos (MVA-BN), a smallpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic and approved by the European Medicines Agency for protection against monkeypox, the hospital said.

On Thursday, vaccinations will also begin in Italy's financial capital, Milan.

The virus continues to be largely transmitted among gay and bisexual men in the current outbreak spreading outside endemic countries, which began in May. Monkeypox is spread chiefly by close contact, causes pus-filled sores and flu-like symptoms, and is rarely fatal. There have now been 26,500 cases worldwide outside the countries where it usually spreads, according to a Reuters tracker.

In July, the World Health Organization declared monkeypox a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" its highest alert level.

Following the WHO's move, the United States — which now has the most cases in the world — also declared monkeypox a public health emergency on Aug. 4.

Italy's Health ministry said gay, bisexual men and transgender people who have recently had sex with multiple partners, recently had a sexually transmitted infection or use chemical drugs when having sex, would be eligible for the vaccine. Hospital staff dealing with monkeypox cases are also eligible.

The first case in Italy was recorded on May 20, 2022. There are no current plans for mass vaccinations.

UK OFFICIALS BELIEVE MONKEYPOX OUTBREAK MAY BE PEAKING

The region of Lazio surrounding Rome received 1,200 doses of the vaccine, while Lombardy received 2,000, Emilia-Romagna received 600 and Veneto surrounding Venice received 400."

""Based on the weather radar, we decided to deviate north and were still getting very strong returns on the onboard weather radar,"" Frans said. ""The clouds were too tall to be able to visually determine a safe route, so we were relying on (air traffic control) reports, the satellite radar report and the onboard weather radar to attempt to navigate a safe path through.""

Frans said they had to veer north across Lake Superior to stay out of the worst of it.

A bumpy ride awaits those who dare enter

But along the journey of their equipment reposition flight, Frans documented rapid development of the cumulonimbus clouds, as heat from below raced skyward into the much cooler atmosphere, exploding into convection along the way. The flat tops of the storms in the distance are informally known as anvil tops due to their obvious resemblance to anvils.

HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER ON TV

Anvils are caused when the rising air hits a stable layer of the atmosphere where the temperature profile prevents the clouds from rising further, instead acting like an invisible wall where the clouds will then spread out along the boundary layer. They're signs of a mature thunderstorm and something you want to avoid flying through as a pilot.

""We would have probably encountered at least moderate turbulence and likely worse,"" Frans said. ""Generally the tops of clouds – especially cumulus – dump a TON of ice into the airframe as you fly through, so the windshield (where it's not heated) would instantly be covered in ice.""

What's more, with temperatures below freezing and strong updrafts in the clouds, the precipitation you'd be flying through is not rain, but hail.

LIGHTNING STRIKES ON AIRPLANES CAN BE SCARY - JUST ASK MILEY CYRUS

""So it would be very loud with 1/4-inch ice balls slamming into the windscreen at 400 mph,"" Frans said. ""And of course the planes are designed to take most of that but if it's severe that's beyond what it's designed for. Also, it can be dangerous if people aren't seat-belted in.""

South Korean President Seok-Yeol Yoon said it was ""regrettable"" that human lives have been lost and instructed local governments and other organizations to continue emergency work systems to do what they can to prevent more loss of life, the press release said.

And because of the flooding in the Seoul area, access to low-lying areas like underpasses, riverbanks and other flood-prone regions will be restricted until further notice.

Before Seoul became the bustling metropolis it is today, the region was a desolate, muddy flatland home to only a few scattered villages.

Today, the region has been developed, and nearly 10 million people call Seoul home. But its geography remains the same – low-lying and prone to flooding.

Flood tunnels and other flood mitigation projects have been constructed and are currently under development and construction, but the Korea Herald reports that fears are growing that they won't be able to withstand the amount of rain and flooding that the area saw on Monday as the system was designed to withstand rain and flooding events on a much smaller scale."

Spanish coast guard divers rescued a 62-year-old French sailor who survived for 16 hours inside an air bubble of his capsized vessel as it drifted in the Atlantic Ocean, officials said Tuesday.

Spain's Maritime Safety and Rescue Society located the French sailboat Jeanne SOLO Sailor overturned about 14 miles from the Sisargas Islands off Spain's northwestern Galicia region, the agency said.

The 40-foot boat had set sail from Lisbon, Portugal, on Sunday morning, and sent a distress signal just before 9 p.m. on Monday, Reuters reported, citing the coast guard.

Rescuers located the overturned ship, and one diver was winched onto the hull to investigate whether anyone was alive, officials said. The trapped man responded to the diver’s knocks on the hull by knocking back.

Divers described the rescue operation as ""verging on the impossible,"" the outlet reported.

The waters were too rough to attempt a rescue until morning, the agency said. Rescuers attached buoyancy devices to the hull to prevent the ship from sinking further.

Once morning arrived, two divers swam under the sailboat and found the man, who has not been identified, in water up to his knees.

The man was able to dive out of the ship on his own, with some help from the divers, and reach the surface of the ocean, the coast guard said.

A campaign to legalize recreational marijuana in Missouri gathered enough signatures to make it on the November ballot, Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft announced Tuesday.

If voters approve the constitutional amendment on marijuana, those age 21 and older could buy and grow it for personal consumption as early as this year.

""We look forward to engaging with voters across the state in the coming weeks and months,"" LegalMo22 campaign manager John Payne said. ""Missourians are more than ready to end the senseless and costly prohibition of marijuana.""

Missouri voters approved medical marijuana use in 2018. Efforts to allow recreational marijuana use have failed to pass Missouri's Republican-led Legislature for years, prompting advocates to go to voters for approval instead.

Recreational marijuana is already legal in 19 states, and legalization proposals are on the ballot this fall in South Dakota and Maryland. Supporters are also trying to get measures on the ballot in Arkansas, North Dakota and Oklahoma.

Backers of the Missouri ballot proposal are highlighting a provision that would erase past marijuana-related convictions for nonviolent offenders and those whose conviction didn’t include selling to minors or driving while high.

Local NAACP chapters, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, criminal defense lawyers and other civil rights advocacy groups endorsed automatic expungement, and it could broaden support for the initiative among Republican criminal justice advocates. Seven other states with legal recreational marijuana have also adopted automatic expungement policies.

Marijuana sales would be taxed at 6% under the Missouri measure. The tax is estimated to bring in more than $46 million during the first full year the amendment is in effect and close to $70 million the following year. Revenues would be earmarked for veterans’ homes, drug treatment programs and public defenders.

Cities and other municipalities could enact local sales taxes on recreational marijuana up to 3% or enact local bans on non-medical marijuana sales by a public vote.

Ashcroft said a separate proposal to allow ranked-choice voting failed to collect the roughly 170,000 voter signatures from six of the state’s eight congressional districts to get on the ballot.

Under that proposal, candidates from all parties would have been listed on primary ballots beginning in August 2024, meaning voters could pick from Republicans and Democrats without requesting a party-specific ballot. The top four candidates with the most votes would move on to the general election, when voters could either pick only their favorite or rank the candidates from first to last.

Better Elections spokesman Scott Charton said in a statement that proponents would honor supporters ""with continued work"" on the issue.

""We just haven’t investigated presidents after they’ve served their term,"" Michael Tabman, former head of the FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office, said. ""But it is a huge move by the FBI in that the political sensitivities are clear. It's obvious that they're dealing on a very, sort of tenuous political climate when you go out and you investigate a president, especially one who says he may run for office again.""

Trump announced on Monday that his palatial Florida residence had been raided early in the morning. Sources told Fox News Digital the search was in connection with materials that Trump took with him from his time as president. Sources also said National Archives and Records Administration referred the case to the Justice Department, which recovered 15 boxes of classified materials from the home.

But Tabman, who is now retired and not involved in the FBI’s investigation into Trump, noted that securing a search warrant ""is no minor task.""

""Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before. After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said Monday.

DOJ REPORTEDLY INVESTIGATING TRUMP'S CONDUCT, CONVERSATIONS AS PART OF 2020 ELECTION PROBE

""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System , and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections,"" the former president continued.

However, ""Squad"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said the FBI is working toward ""accountability"" and went as far as to say Trump should be in prison.

""That’s what happens when you break the law, try to steal an election, and incite a deadly insurrection. Donald Trump should be in jail. I’m glad to see the FBI taking steps towards accountability.""

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., called Trump's statement ""defensive"" during an MSNBC segment Monday.

""But look, the FBI doesn't just go in unless a judge signs off on a search warrant. That means they have some probable evidence about possible wrongdoing. And it's something that the whole country needs to pay attention to and shows that Justice Garland, Attorney General Garland is setting this up step by step,"" he stated.

""I think Attorney General Garland and the Justice Department have done a very good job by following the facts,"" he said. ""I do think that this gives me confidence that the Justice Department is really pursuing this thoroughly, objectively and in a nonpolitical way,"" Khanna continued.

Congressional Republicans also took to Twitter, criticizing the FBI's ""unprecedented"" raid.

""The only thing missing from the unprecedented FBI raid at President Trump’s home is Muammar Gaddafi’s sunglasses and cap on Joe Biden,"" wrote Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.

Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., asked on Twittter: ""What does the FBI know about Hunter Biden?""

GOP Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana mentioned the $739 billion Manchin-Schumer bill that just passed the senate, which expanded the IRS, in his rebuke of the FBI's action.

""If the FBI can raid the home of a former US President, imagine what 87,000 more IRS agents will do to you,"" he quipped on Twitter.

South Carolina Senator Tim Scott echoed Banks' sentiment on Mark Levin's radio show.

""Biden is dividing our country and the DOJ seems to be reinforcing that division through their actions… that is very dangerous to the everyday person walking on the streets of America,"" Scott said to Levin on Monday night.

""We must have 100% confidence and trust in our justice system,"" the Republican senator added. ""And if they can target a former president, you know, they could target me and you.""

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel called the raid ""outrageous.""

""Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Countless times we have examples of Democrats flouting the law and abusing power with no recourse, including Hunter Biden. Democrats continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans. This raid is outrageous,"" she wrote on Twitter.

Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority.

Legal scholars are questioning whether the FBI's raid on former President Donald Trump's Florida home over classified White House documents was necessary.

Some experts told Fox News Digital the basis for the raid, which centers on Trump's purported failure to hand over potentially classified documents to the National Archives, is unprecedented.

GOP SLAMS 'WEAPONIZATION' OF DOJ AFTER TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RAIDED BY FBI; DEMS CALL IT 'ACCOUNTABILITY'

""Based on what we now know, it was totally unjustified, even one FBI agent would have been too many,"" said Alan Dershowitz, a professor at Harvard Law School who served on Trump's legal team for the president's first impeachment case. ""The whole process was wrong and Trump was away at the time, so they can't say he was going to destroy anything.""

Legal scholars note that when individuals previously violated the law regarding classified documents, the Justice Department has opted to either not prosecute or settle for lesser charges.

""The Presidential Records Act is not commonly a subject of criminal prosecution, even in the most egregious cases,"" said Jonathan Turley, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. ""These incidents have generally been handled administratively.""

In 2004, for instance, the DOJ prosecuted former Clinton-era National Security Adviser Sandy Berger for the unauthorized removal and destruction of classified material from the National Archives. The former NSA adviser removed from the National Archives five copies of a report detailing the Clinton administration's handling of a series of unsuccessful terror attacks planned by al Qaeda for the 2000 millennium.

Berger, who removed copies of the report by stuffing them in his pants and socks, was sentenced to only two years probation and stripped of his security clearance for three years.

""These cases overall have not been subject to aggressive criminal prosecution in the past,"" said Turley.

FORMER TRUMP OFFICIAL MICHAEL CAPUTO BLASTS FBI'S MAR-A-LAGO RAID: 'FULL-BLOWN CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS'

A large group of FBI agents raided Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate Monday with search warrants. The raid was reportedly related to materials the former president brought to the residence after leaving the White House in January 2021.

The Presidential Records Act of 1978 and other federal laws bar the removal of classified documents from unauthorized locations. For months, the National Archives has sought to obtain documents pertaining to Trump's White House tenure from Mar-a-Lago.

In February, Trump handed the record-keeping agency 15 boxes of documents from the estate, including official correspondence between Trump and foreign heads of state.

""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" the former president said in a statement. Trump's representatives had informed the archives that they are continuing to search for additional Presidential records that belong to the National Archives

Some experts question the need for the raid if Trump was, as claimed, cooperating with the National Archives. They note that the National Archives would have had to refer the matter to the Justice Department.

""To get a warrant, prosecutors would need probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the search would turn up evidence or fruits of the crime at the location of the search,"" said Robert Leider, an assistant professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University.

Given Trump's status as a former head of state, Attorney General Merrick Garland likely would have to approve the search warrant. The warrant would have had to specify what crimes they believed Trump had committed.

Critics say the Justice Department needs to be transparent about its reasoning for the raid.

""This is a historic raid on the residence of a former president as well as a presumed candidate for the next presidential election,"" said Turley. ""The public needs to know the reasons for the Justice Department's decision.

Others also criticized the way in which the raid was handled. Dershowitz, in particular, noted that FBI agents likely seized documents without inquiring if they were classified, declassified, or personal to Trump.

""The Justice Department had no right to seize them indiscriminately because some may not be classified and others may be classified above their level,"" he said. ""There are things that have been declassified by the president, which the Justice Department doesn't know about.""

Since Trump had handed over documents to the National Archives in the past, experts say the federal government should have simply subpoenaed the records as required. Instead, they claim the Justice Department has now created a situation where everything seized by the FBI will have to be reviewed by both sides to ensure Trump's privacy is not invaded.

""Trump's lawyers should be in court already demanding that nobody in the government look in any of the boxes until they have an opportunity to challenge the reason for the raid,"" said Dershowitz."

Graham also said Tuesday that the fact the raid happened just three months before a major midterm election is suspect, and said there would be massive outrage if something similar happened to a Democrat.

""We're 90 days before an election. The FBI sent agents to the home of a former president, the leading contender to be the nominee for 2024, and I want to know why,"" Graham said. ""I know doing this 90 days before an election reek of politics… Can you imagine if the roles were reversed here?""

Some members of Senate GOP leadership have made similar comments to Graham's, demanding transparency about the search. But Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declined to comment when asked about the raid Tuesday.

High-ranking congressional Democrats, meanwhile, have generally held off from making pointed statements in the immediate wake of the raid. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., did, however, point out that there is a high evidentiary standard for law enforcement to get a search warrant.

""All I know about that is what is in the public domain. I was surprised that it flashed on my phone last evening, so I don't really have too much to say except that to have a visit like that, you need a warrant. To have a warrant, you need justification.

""I stood up to the Radical Left’s corruption. I restored power to the people and truly delivered for our Country like we have never seen before. The establishment hated it,"" Trump said.

The search intensifies the monthslong investigation into how classified documents ended up in boxes of White House records located at Mar-a-Lago earlier this year. It occurs amid a separate grand jury investigation into efforts by Trump and his associates to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and adds to the legal peril for the former president as he lays the groundwork for a run in 2024.

Bob Barnes, the man who has been cycling to all 50 U.S. state capitals in one year, spotted two major landmarks while he was riding through South Dakota and North Dakota recently.

But beyond that, happy memories of his positive interactions with residents of these states and his experiences in both states have stayed with him.

NY MAN CYCLING ACROSS AMERICA HITS SC, REVEALS THE ONE RELIGIOUS SYMBOL HE'S SEEN NATIONWIDE

Here are more specifics of what he saw as he neared the end of his all-American biking trip — and why these experiences stood out for him.

'Every single person is friendly'

Barnes arrived in South Dakota on May 24.

The very next day, he rode through the city of De Smet, where the Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Homes are located.

Wilder, an American author, wrote the ""Little House on the Prairie"" book series. She and her family lived in De Smet for several years.

Barnes said he had no idea Wilder's home was in De Smet until he noticed signs three blocks away.

""I was like, ‘Wow that is really cool,’"" Barnes told Fox News Digital. ""That was the real deal. That was a nice experience.""

""Every single person is friendly. Everybody’s in a good mood, and it’s actually catching.""

Barnes said everyone he met during his time there waved at him and said hello.

""They just come up and talk to you,"" Barnes said.

""I’ve had more people come up and talk to me in South Dakota than any other state.""

""It’s awesome,"" he added. ""It’s fun … I just soak it in.""

Barnes pointed out that while he was cycling, he didn't come across many people on the road — and that, at times, he felt ""a little lonely.""

""But you just keep going,"" he said. ""You know where the next town is and you just get to it.""

Barnes said he had one of his best weeks of riding through South Dakota, reaching 433 miles in one week.

""That was really cool,"" Barnes said. ""That was a confidence booster. I know now what I have physically and I’m even more confident I’ll get [the trip] done.""

It helped that the terrain wasn’t so bad — and that drivers gave Barnes a lot of space on the road.

""South Dakota was kind of flawless,"" Barnes said about his ride.

""We did a lot of miles in South Dakota, but we got in, we got out,"" he said, referring to himself and his set of wheels. ""It was a very efficient ride through South Dakota.""

American state with ‘the best scenery'

Barnes arrived in North Dakota on May 30.

Just before reaching his 44th capital of Bismarck, on June 2, Barnes donated platelets — something he's been doing at various points along his journey as he works to raise awareness about the importance of donating blood and helping others.

""That was the first time I did my donation and visited a capital [in the same day], so that’s like a home run,"" Barnes said of his accomplishment.

Barnes said his platelet donation went well.

""They treated me like a celebrity — I get a little embarrassed when that happens,"" he added.

""They actually bought me food,"" Barnes said.

""They bought me Famous Dave’s. They bought me a brisket sandwich and that was good.""

""It was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life,"" Barnes said.

""I’ve never had dumplings before.""

On his way out of the state, Barnes saw the Badlands, the landforms in western North Dakota.

""That was fantastic,"" Barnes said. ""That was some of the best scenery in the entire country.""

He continued, ""That was definitely a high point and a surprise. It just came out of nowhere and it was … jaw-dropping.""

Barnes even came across a herd of wild mustangs. ""They were beautiful,"" he said. ""Just so cool.""

While he was in North Dakota, Barnes went through his belongings to prepare for the final part of his trip, he said.

He threw away his two camping chairs, his dress clothes and shoes, three broken cellphones — and extra tent items like poles, covers and stakes.

He also collected all his loose change, which he said weighed about two pounds. He planned to use the change at a nearby store.

""I intently went to a convenience store and I was going to buy some scratch-off tickets and give them to the clerk just to be a nice person,"" Barnes explained.

""But they don’t sell scratch-offs in North Dakota.""

Later, Barnes left behind his trailer — which carried most of his belongings — and instead packed everything in his saddlebags attached to his bike.

Barnes said he left his trailer and hammock behind, along with a note saying the items were free for the taking.

Barnes did keep his French press, his stove, some clothes, his sandals and his solar panel, which helps him charge his phone.

Leaving his trailer behind, he said, ""made a remarkable difference.""

""I’ll never pull a trailer again,"" he said.

Next stop: Treasure State

After Bob Barnes left North Dakota on June 4, he arrived in Montana, heading for capital no. 45 on his trip: Helena.

After visiting all of the Lower 48 states, he took a ferry to Juneau, Alaska, from Canada and rode on his bicycle to the capitol — as he previously shared with Fox News Digital that he would be doing.

From there, he flew with his bike to Hawaii and rode from the airport to the capitol building to complete his trip.

The Statue of Liberty, perhaps the most celebrated symbol of American ideals and exceptionalism, reopened after the 9/11 attacks on this day in history, August 3, 2004.

The globally recognized landmark had been closed to the public for nearly three years following the destruction of the nearby World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.

Lady Liberty stood stoically watching over the horror in Lower Manhattan that day, little more than a mile across New York Harbor.

""This beacon of hope and liberty is once again open to the public, sending a reassuring message to the world that freedom is alive in New York and shining brighter than ever before,"" said then-Gov.

The celebration featured pomp and circumstance, including a performance of ""You're a Grand Old Flag"" and the national anthem by a military choir.

But the event also came amid concerns about terror attacks that loomed over the nation long after 9/11. New York City, nearby Newark, N.J. and Washington, D.C., all faced terror threats in the days before the reopening ceremony.

Lady Liberty's interior metal framework was fabricated by Gustave Eiffel, who immediately afterward began building the iconic tower in Paris that bears his name.

It was closed for two years from 1984 to 1986 for extensive restoration work before its centennial celebration.

Visitors could access the statue's famous torch for the first 30 years of its existence.

But public access to the torch was ended following the deadly ""Black Tom explosion"" of July 30, 1916.

The Statue of Liberty's torch was among the structures damaged by explosion fragments.

As the U.S. contemplated entry into World War I, German spies sabotaged a barge in New York Harbor filled with an estimated 2 million pounds of arms and munitions destined for Allies in Europe. The horrific explosion could be felt as far away as Philadelphia.

The team surpassed its goal of $10,000 — raising $12,083 for the cause as of current.

Teammate Brooke Downes shared the experience in an interview with Fox News Digital, repeating the team’s mission statement which was to ""get to Hawaii as fast as possible.""

The rower revealed how breaking the record was, at times, questionable.

""The last couple of days we had really terrible conditions and our expected time of arrival just kept getting pushed back later and later,"" she said.

Besides hitting rocky waters at the tail end of the voyage, Downes remembered moving ""terribly slow"" about two weeks into the race due to the wind conditions.

This slow movement lasted for about five days in intense heat.

""Out there in the middle of the ocean, we had so much fun,"" she said.

""More fun than I could have ever expected to have.""

""There was one day that the conditions were perfect for us to jump in the water and swim,"" she added.

""That was a really special day for us to all be together, swimming in this spot off land [where] probably no other human has ever been.""

HOW TO EXERCISE DURING A WORK TRIP AND STAY FIT WHILE TRAVELING

Downes expressed feeling ""grateful"" for her teammates’ support on nights when conditions were rough and sometimes outright painful physically.

Each teammate rowed for two hours on and two hours off to balance adequate sleep — and to allow the team members to manage other tasks, such as preparing freeze-dried meals and handling boat maintenance.

The crew made 25 liters of purified water per day, through a pressurized system and solar energy — which they used to drink, cook, rinse off and clean their clothes.

""Every single day brings something new,"" she said.

""But the schedule is exactly the same the entire time.""

Each woman only brought along enough clothes to satisfy every weather condition, including rain, intense heat and even cold weather.

The cabins on the front and back ends of the boat slept two rowers each, which was a tight squeeze for Downes, who measures 5’11"" in height.

""It’s pretty amazing how much you can fit in the boat,"" she said. ""But you didn't bring anything that you didn't need.""

Downes detailed how each woman only brought enough clothes to satisfy every weather condition, including rain, intense heat and even cold weather.

""The beginning was very cold,"" she said.

""And extra-cold because we would have to put on the same wet clothes to row.""

The women encountered other obstacles on the water, such as being hit by flying fish. Also, the boat’s rudder was knocked out of place by an unidentified marine animal — sending the boat spinning.

The boat’s bearings also began to corrode halfway through the journey. That was caused by different metals being mixed into the wheels.

""We made it to the finish line with no spare wheels,"" she said.

It took about a day and a half after the women first spotted Hawaii’s mountainous landscape to officially reach land.

New Jersey-born Downes, who graduated from the University of Southern California in 2019, described the journey as ""the best decision"" she’s ever made as a rower of more than 10 years.

""I was really curious,"" she said.

""I wanted to know what it was like to be out in the middle of the ocean with nobody around … during this huge, incredible race.""

""I love rowing, and I want to row even more now.""

The rower said there was ""nothing stopping"" her except fear, so teammate Libby Costello — a longtime friend of Downes — invited her to join the Lat 35 crew.

Downes accepted the offer, quit her job and moved to Santa Barbara to begin training.

""I thought, I can either watch that whole experience and wish that I was doing it with her — or I can actually do it with her,"" she said.

""And it was the best decision I’ve made.""

Downes, who was training for the National Rowing Team prior to the race, is aspiring to qualify for the Olympics in 2024, but said she’ll be taking some time to recuperate first.

""I love rowing, and I want to row even more now,"" she said.

Denison-Johnston is also an Olympic hopeful.

Downes is currently enjoying her time in Hawaii.

The record for fastest male rowers was also broken by a Lat 35 team during the 2021 race.

Alabama is one of 15 states that do not ask voters to register with a political party ahead of a voting in a primary. Some Republicans argue it’s time to change that.

The Alabama Republican Party will take a vote this weekend on whether to support a party registration requirement for primaries, also known as having a closed primary. Passage of the resolution would signal support for the idea, but the Alabama Legislature would have to enact legislation to make such a change.

""I very much expect it to pass,"" Alabama Republican Party Chairman John Wahl said of the party resolution. The state GOP approved a similar resolution in 2016.

Currently, voters casting ballots in a primary election in Alabama simply tell a poll worker which ballot they want. Wahl said there is growing concern about possible cross-over voting. Republicans should be electing Republican nominees, he said.

""I think this is an issue that has been highlighted by this election cycle. We’ve seen so much frustration from candidates, voters, as well as the members of the Republican Party, towards Democrats purposely trying to affect the outcome of our Republican primaries,"" Wahl said.

Wahl said the resolution endorses the idea of a closed primary, but doesn't recommend any specific method. States have different rules regarding primary voting and party registration.

Only nine states have completely closed primaries where a voter seeking to vote in a closed primary must first be a registered party member, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Other states have partially open or partially closed primaries, where unaffiliated voters may be able to vote in a primary or where voters can change their party affiliation on primary day.

McConnell was in his home state after floods recently hit the eastern part of his state, killing dozens. President Biden and Jill Biden even visited the state Monday in the wake of the natural disaster.

The minority leader's refusal to talk about the search warrant served on Trump's private home comes as Senate GOP leadership has been slower than their House counterparts to comment on the raid.

Sources told Fox News Digital the search was in connection with materials that Trump took with him from his time as president.

FIRST ON FOX: Veteran political strategists James Carville and Ed Rollins aren't quite seeing eye to eye on the political impact the FBI's raid on former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home could have on the midterm elections.

Speaking with Fox News Digital Tuesday, Carville, who was an adviser to former President Bill Clinton, said there wasn't enough information about the raid to know just yet what it could mean for voters heading to the polls.

But Rollins, a Republican, predicted the event could end up being the ""biggest issue in the midterms.""

""The attorney general and the FBI need to explain to the American public what they were doing and why,"" Rollins, an adviser to former President Ronald Reagan, said when asked about the raid.

""This is an invasion of a man's home … and the public has a right to know why.""

He added that Trump had a right to know if he was being suspected of committing a crime and that it was his right to defend himself.

""To argue they are gathering evidence is not good enough. Trump not only is a former president, but certainly is the front-runner for a future nomination and possible re-election,"" Rollins said.

""This could become the biggest issue in the midterms, and the ruthless abuse of power could overcome all else. It has already stepped on all other news that Biden and his team wanted to promote on his legislative record,"" Rollins added.

He was referring to the passage of a number of Democrat-backed legislative priorities being overshadowed by news of the raid.

Carville took a different tone, appearing more hesitant to say the Mar-a-Lago raid would play a central role either way in upcoming elections.

He did, however, warn ""right-wing"" media personalities and commentators to ""tread very carefully"" in criticizing the raid, arguing that the documents and data the FBI had to justify the raid were likely ""substantial.""

Carville then argued that if Trump's claims that the raid was political were true, then he should make the search warrant public.

""I can't imagine that that search warrant said anything less than something just overwhelming. And if it's not, then Trump can make it public,"" he said.

Similarly, two years later, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., accused Barr of acting as Trump's ""personal henchman"" following a report that claimed the DOJ secretly subpoenaed records for two Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.

""This is an EXTREME and dangerous abuse of power,"" Jayapal wrote. ""It is wholly unacceptable to weaponize the DOJ against members of Congress. Bill Barr consistently acted as Trump's personal henchman, and he must be held fully accountable for his actions.""

Earlier this year, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., one of seven Democrats serving on the nine-member January 6 committee panel, said Trump tried to ""weaponize"" the DOJ in an attempt ""to retain power.""

""Today @January6thCmte will expose how Donald Trump tried to weaponize the Department of Justice in his desperate bid to retain power,"" Raskin wrote. ""Watch at 3pm ET as witnesses, including the former Acting Attorney General, reveal how Trump nearly made the Big Lie DOJ policy.""

Despite the Trump-era accusations made by the House Democrats, the party, overall, is now silent or lauding the Justice Department after Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida was raided by FBI agents on Monday.

Pelosi said Tuesday she believed the FBI must have ""justification"" for the raid.

""All I know about that is what is in the public domain. I was surprised that it flashed on my phone last evening, so I don't really have too much to say except that to have a visit like that, you need a warrant. To have a warrant, you need justification. And that says that no one is above the law, not even a president or a former president of the United States,"" Pelosi told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

Raskin, during an appearance on MSNBC, also responded briefly to the raid at Mar-a-Lago, insisting that Americans have an ""interest"" in the rule of law.

""The great thing about the separation of powers is we knew nothing about that,"" Raskin said. ""We don't know whether that's something related to what we're working on or not...""

""Everybody in America, and speaking as a citizen, we all have an interest in the rule of law in the country and respect for the rule of law, and resistance to the lawlessness that seems to be always out there,"" he added.

In a tweet issued Monday after the raid was made public, Jayapal sang a different tune as she claimed the FBI is taking steps toward ""accountability"" and suggested that Trump should be in prison.

""That’s what happens when you break the law, try to steal an election, and incite a deadly insurrection,"" she wrote. ""Donald Trump should be in jail. I’m glad to see the FBI taking steps towards accountability.""

Multiple sources tell Fox News the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago is related to the materials Trump allegedly brought to his private residence after his presidency concluded. That matter was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority.

Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., said the unprecedented FBI raid at former President Donald Trump’s residence at Mar-a-Lago is not the first ""October surprise"" carried out by the agency on behalf of Democrats, noting the timing of the arrests in the alleged kidnapping plot targeting Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

""The same FBI that cooked up a plot to kidnap governors before an election just raided Biden’s most likely challenger,"" Bishop tweeted on Monday evening amid breaking news of the Mar-a-Lago raid. ""Democrats are cheering on the weaponization of law enforcement against political opponents. They don’t care about ‘democracy’: just crushing their enemies.""

Bishop joined other GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee in demanding U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray urgently testify regarding the Trump raid.

In a follow-up tweet on Tuesday, Bishop noted that jury selection has begun in the re-trial of two of the four men charged in federal court in connection to an alleged kidnapping plot targeting Whitmer in October 2020 allegedly over disgust with the Democrat’s lockdown restrictions.

TRUMP FBI RAID: HILLARY CLINTON APPEARS TO FUNDRAISE OFF MAR-A-LAGO SEARCH

In April, a federal jury could not reach a verdict for Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr., but two other co-defendants, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta, were found not guilty and acquitted on all charges.

Defense attorneys had accused the FBI of entrapment, painting their clients of marijuana-smoking weekend warriors, rather than domestic extremists weeded out by an FBI informant.

""As the retrial begins for 2 of the accused in the FBI Whitmer plot, remember: Arrests were announced on Oct. 8th, 2020, during early voting. A perfect October surprise,"" Bishop tweeted Tuesday. ""If you're still inclined to give the FBI the benefit of the doubt here, think again.""

Bishop shared a link to a story by The Wall Street Journal outlining how the two acquitted men in the alleged Whitmer kidnapping plot could pose an uphill battle for prosecutors during the retrial, noting how a former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan admitted that the ""big question is, did the FBI arrest these defendants too quickly, before they gathered enough evidence.""

Bishop wrote about the case in a recent op-ed for North State Journal. The congressman pointed out how during a recent hearing hosted by the House Judiciary Committee, he questioned Matthew Olsen, assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice’s National Security Division.

""I questioned Mr. Olsen about a disturbing trend emerging in the DOJ’s efforts to detect and thwart domestic terrorism plots. Specifically, weeks before the 2020 election, the FBI announced it had foiled an alleged plot to kidnap the Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer. Two years later, the story is quite different,"" Bishop said, noting how two of the men charged were acquitted on grounds of entrapment and the jury was hung on the two others.

""It is clear from the current evidence that federal agents cooked up this operation, trained recruits to carry out the FBI’s plan, directed recruitment efforts, and incentivized the informants with handsome paydays in order to keep the plot moving forward – all on the taxpayers’ dime,"" Bishop wrote. ""It leaves an important question: Is this how the DOJ carries its operations?""

Pence's statement emerged only after many other Republicans had commented before him, despite the close relationship Pence says he had with Trump in the White House.

Senior Senate Republicans, who have themselves reacted only gradually, Tuesday demanded that the FBI immediately release information about its raid of former President Trump's Florida estate, which they are calling a major law enforcement escalation against a former president.

The statements, from GOP Conference Chair John Barrasso, R-Wyo., Vice Conference Chair Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Rick Scott, R-Fla., come as top Senate Republicans overall have been slower to comment on the raid than their counterparts in House GOP leadership.

Vermont voters will choose candidates Tuesday to fill a seat in the U.S. Senate that has been occupied since 1975 by retiring Democratic U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the last of Congress's so-called Watergate babies, elected after the resignation of former President Richard Nixon.

The leading Democratic candidate to run for Leahy's seat in the November election is U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, a liberal Democrat known for working across the aisle. Welch has held his House seat since 2007. During the years he has been in Congress, Welch has been one of Vermont's top vote getters and would be an odds-on favorite to win the general election.

Vermont's former U.S. Attorney Christina Nolan and retired U.S. Army officer Gerald Malloy are the two leading candidates vying for the Republican Party nomination for the November election.

Both Nolan and Malloy believe they can win the seat. Vermont is considered by many to be one of the most liberal states in country. No Republican has represented the state in Washington since 2001 when the late Sen. Jim Jeffords left the GOP to become an independent, switching control of the Senate from Republican to Democratic.

But the state, with its small congressional delegation, has never sent a woman or a member of a minority group to represent it in Washington.

Welch’s decision to run for the Senate seat opens up his seat in the House, the first time since 2006 that there have been any openings in Vermont’s three-member congressional delegation. The two leading Democratic candidates are Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and state Senate President Pro Tempore, Becca Balint.

In deep blue Vermont it’s likely the winner of the Democratic House primary will win easily in November, erasing what some consider to be the blot on the liberal state’s reputation of only being represented by white men.

The two share similar policy views, but the race is pitting Gray, a centrist candidate supported by the state's Democratic establishment, and Balint, who is being supported by the progressive wing of the party in Vermont and nationally.

The two leading GOP candidates for the U.S. House nomination are Ericka Redic, of Burlington, and Liam Madden, a Marine Corps veteran from Bellows Falls.

Redic says that if elected she would focus on fighting inflation, illegal immigration, drug misuse and government overreach, particularly as it concerns vaccine mandates.

Madden, a non-traditional candidate in the Republican primary, says he's an independent. He said he had thought of declining the nomination if he wins, until he learned that would allow the party to choose a replacement for the November ballot.

The Vermont primary will also choose the nominees for governor.

There is simply no question, by any objective standard, that Joe Biden is on a hot streak.

After many months of muddled messaging and plummeting polls, the president has pushed through a raft of important legislation, culminating with a sweeping climate change/health care/corporate taxes measure that will win final approval this week. Some of the bills passed with strong bipartisan support. And it’s been just over a week since the president announced that on his orders, a drone strike had killed the leader of al Qaeda.

But all this may have little impact on Biden’s attempt to rally his party behind him in seeking a second term. The media narrative against him – that he’s too old, too slow, and that most Democrats want a younger candidate – could be too powerful to alter, baked into the midterm cake.

That may be unfair to Biden, who now has a stronger slate of legislative accomplishments than any president in decades, but life is unfair. He would be 82 at the next inauguration and too many of his voters – along with Democratic lawmakers – seem ready to give him a gold watch and a hearty sendoff.

BEHIND THE KANSAS ABORTION SHOCKER : WHY SOME RED STATES DON'T WANT A TOTAL BAN

Imagine a football team that goes 2-7, with growing calls to fire the coach, and then wins its last 7 games to pull out a winning record. Does the strong finish erase the memory of its earlier awfulness?

Keep in mind that journalists worship polls. If Biden were suddenly to get a healthy bump, the media would start doing pieces about his comeback, easing fears among fellow Democrats that he will drag his party down in 2022 and be a weak candidate two years later. But without that short-term pop, the conventional wisdom remains that inflation (though Biden has brought down gas prices somewhat) will drive a sweeping Republican victory in November.

And then there’s the nature of the climate legislation itself, the dubiously named Inflation Reduction Act. Even Bernie Sanders says it will have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation.

The truth is it will take a while for ordinary folks to feel the effects of the $700-billion bill, and elections are won or lost in the short term.

The measure provides the greatest investment in climate change by a single country, but global warming won’t ease for years, and even the clean-energy funds will have to be awarded and workers hired before anyone’s life is improved.

As the Washington Post points out, the $7,500 credits for buying electric cars only happen if manufacturers displace Chinese batteries by 2024.

Allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices is a long-sought goal, but that will also take some time. The $300 billion in deficit reduction is an important step, but for most Americans the deficit is an abstraction.

Meanwhile, some liberal Democrats can barely hide their dissatisfaction with Biden. In the case of two veteran House members running against each other in a New York district, Jerry Nadler said it’s too early to talk about 2024 and Carolyn Maloney said she doesn’t think Biden’s running (and then apologized by saying she’ll back him if he does but still doesn’t think he will). That is hardly the mark of a strong incumbent.

Rather than trying to hector him out of the race, Maureen Dowd used her New York Times column to appeal to Biden’s sense of history: ""He could leave on a high, knowing that he has delivered on his promises for progress and restored decency to the White House.""

Biden wasted months fighting for on a left-wing fantasy bill whose absurd price tag – $3.5 trillion – meant it would never come close to passing a 50-50 Senate. And while Republicans spent many hours trashing the new bill that they can’t stop because of reconciliation – just as Democrats did with the Trump tax cuts – it’s a far more moderate measure than would spend less than a quarter of the original measure.

Maybe this gives Biden a more solid platform to sell himself as worthy of four more years. But for now there’s a profound disconnect between Biden and his voters on whether the man who first ran for president in 1987 should make one last run."

What happened in Kansas is what the Supreme Court, and defenders of its abortion ruling, say they wanted.

Not the outcome, to be sure: A stunning surge of voters who supported keeping the right to abortion in the state constitution, just a point below the level considered a landslide victory.

But the whole rationale for overturning Roe v. Wade was to take such decisions out of the hands of unelected judges and put them closer to the people, on a state by state basis. Well, in Kansas, a conservative state where Republicans far outnumber Democrats, the people have spoken, with a 59 to 41% declaration.

HOW POWERHOUSE PERSONALITTIES DRIVE EVERYONE CRAZY - AND OFTEN CHANGE HISTORY

But it serves as a national warning that complete bans on abortion, while inevitable in some red states, are not so easily accomplished. And many Republican lawmakers must have woken up yesterday and wondered whether they need to compromise.

It’s no coincidence that some conservative Republican governors haven’t seized this moment to make abortion totally illegal in their states. Ron DeSantis, who obviously has 2024 ambitions, is sticking with his past position of no abortions after 15 weeks – which might have seemed dramatic a few months ago but is now a middle ground, perhaps better suited to Florida and a White House campaign.

What is fueling the abortion rights side, in my view, is extensive media coverage of the lack of exceptions proposed in some state bans. The Idaho GOP has endorsed the idea of not allowing abortions even if the mother’s life is in danger. And stories about women with serious miscarriages being allowed to bleed for days because the treatment is the same as an abortion haven’t exactly projected an image of compassion.

The rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl who went to Indiana for an abortion, once it was confirmed, provides a graphic case for those who say it is cruel and heartless to force victims to give birth to their rapist’s babies.

Tudor Dixon, who won the GOP nomination for Michigan governor on Tuesday, described a hypothetical 14-year-old girl who is sexually assaulted by her uncle as a ""perfect example"" of someone who should be forced to give birth. Asked if she wanted to soften her remarks, Dixon said, ""I’m not hiding from it.""

These legal battles will play out in all 50 states, and now the Justice Department has joined the fray. DOJ sued over the new Idaho law, saying it violates a federal requirement (for hospitals accepting Medicare) that medical care must be provided when a pregnant woman’s life or health is at stake. Merrick Garland said ""we will use every tool at our disposal"" to ensure such treatment.

President Biden signed an executive order yesterday aiming to protect women who travel out of state for abortions, but its weak language only directs HHS to ""consider"" such action. The travel question is certain to be another front in this legal war.

In Kansas, advocacy groups poured millions into advertising campaigns, with the Catholic Church and other religious groups weighing in on one side and national abortion rights groups on the other.

Turns out the pro-choice side won counties where Donald Trump won big victories last time, making clear there were plenty of Republicans who at least favored allowing abortions with some restrictions.

It was, no question, a victory for America and the world.

The drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahri, the leader of al Qaeda, took out one of the world’s most despicable terrorists, the intellectual force behind the group who, as Usama bin Laden’s number two, helped mastermind the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. And Zawahri pulled off devastating attacks before that, including the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, which prompted the Clinton administration to target him.

It was also a big win for President Biden, and yet no one felt more of a sense of closure than the families of the 9/11 victims. Zawahri was a central plotter for the hijacked airplanes that toppled the World Trade Center, slammed into the Pentagon, and would have struck a third target if not for the bravery of passengers above Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

That utterly transformed our politics for years, plunging us into an age of not bringing liquids on airplanes, passing homeland security laws and waging a 20-year war in Afghanistan.

HOW POWERHOUSE PERSONALITTIES DRIVE EVERYONE CRAZY - AND OFTEN CHANGE HISTORY

This was not a military operation of the kind that killed Usama bin Laden in 2011, with Biden sitting in the famous Situation Room photo as he, President Obama and other leaders waited for the results of the Navy SEAL raid. While officials aren’t saying this publicly, it was a CIA counterterrorism operation. It took another 11 years for Biden to authorize the strike that killed Zawahri on Saturday.

Zawahri’s gray-bearded visage had become familiar to Americans when he took over al Qaeda and made a series of videos to deliver terror messages. It’s true he was past his prime, but this was about accountability.

TRUMP AGAIN DOMINATING THE NEWS, BIDEN'S BLISTERING SPEECH A SIDEBAR

From a White House balcony, where he is still sidelined by COVID-19, Biden told the country: ""Justice has been delivered, and this terrorist leader is no more… We make it clear again tonight that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out.""

Biden deserves credit for the tough call, as some Republicans acknowledged, but this is not going to transform the midterms. It will soon fade from the news with voters remaining focused on inflation, COVID-19 and other domestic issues. Even Obama only got a short-term bump for taking out bin Laden.

Now we come to a more complicated question.

Biden has a strong argument that his approach has been vindicated after he presided over the worst foreign policy debacle in generations, the violent and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. The president said then that the U.S. could conduct counterterrorism missions even without boots on the ground – and the CIA operation proved him right, with reports of no civilian casualties.

But Republicans are taking some shots over the fact that Zawarhi was in Kabul at all. Under the withdrawal deal – negotiated by Donald Trump in 2020, and later accepted by Biden – the Taliban pledged not to harbor any terror organization with international aims.

Is anyone really shocked that the Taliban, which claim to have had no idea of Zawarhi’s presence, are lying? He lived in a luxurious home in a wealthy gated community in the capital, not far from the U.S. Embassy. He returned after the Taliban takeover, let down his guard, and it took our intelligence service months to confirm his presence and his practice of spending time on his balcony, the spot where he was killed – after his family moved to another Kabul home.

Can anyone really doubt that the Taliban regime, which has also flouted its promises on human rights, is shielding other al Qaeda terrorists as well?

Some conservatives are ripping Biden for claiming al Qaeda’s presence had vanished. But the Taliban takeover clearly changed things.

That’s American politics. But the larger point – that the last remaining 9/11 plotter has been held accountable for his heinous crimes – is what history will remember."

Media commentators ranging from Donald Trump's strongest foes to most fervent allies appeared in agreement on one thing Monday: the FBI raid of his Mar-a-Lago home may have handed him the 2024 Republican nomination.

The FBI executed a search warrant of the former president's Florida residence on Monday, stunning the news industry and incensing Trump and his supporters. Sources told Fox News Digital the search was in connection with materials that Trump took with him from his time as president. Sources also said National Archives and Records Administration referred the case to the Justice Department, which recovered 15 boxes of classified materials from the home.

CNN commentator Alyssa Farah Griffin, who served as Trump's White House communications director but is now one of his fiercest critics, fretted on ""New Day"" that an empty-handed raid could send Trump to the White House.

""This, I'm hoping, goes beyond simply not complying with some archiving laws, or [the Department of Justice] just handed Donald Trump the Republican [nomination] and potentially the presidency,"" she said. ""If it's seen as some sort of massive overreach and not something incredibly serious, this is a very good day for Donald Trump.""

NANCY PELOSI REACTS TO FBI RAID ON TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RESORT, SAYS AUTHORITIES HAD 'JUSTIFICATION'

Joe Walsh, the ex-GOP congressman who like Farah Griffin evolved from a passionate Trump fan to one of his sharpest media foes, also expressed concern the search of the former president's home may rally his supporters behind the flag.

""Both things are true: 1. The Justice Department’s job is to pursue justice & uphold the rule of law. And they should NEVER let politics get in the way of that. Yesterday, they did their job. 2. What happened yesterday handed the 2024 GOP nomination to Donald Trump,"" he tweeted.

Trump has essentially frozen the 2024 GOP field as he gives hints that he will make a third run for the White House without formally announcing yet. His dramatic statement about the raid said his home had been ""occupied,"" ""raided,"" and was ""under siege"" by the FBI, and it received a strong reaction from his backers.

CNN's Dana Bash said Trump had greatly advanced his short-term political goal of capturing the nomination, saying his language in the statement about the raid was ""kind of genius.""

""It totally triggers and animates the people not only who like him, but there was concern, according to people around Trump, that he had, that he was losing some mojo. He was having some trouble raising money. And this, he believes, would turn it around,"" she said.

2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who has since formed the new Forward Party, worried that the raid would contribute to the depiction of Trump ""against a corrupt government establishment. The raid strengthens that case for millions of Americans who will see this as unjust persecution.""

""Trump is winning the FBI-raid caucus going away—we’ll learn more, but this is his best day in pursuit of the 2024 nomination in a long time,"" National Review's Rich Lowry tweeted.

""Was the FBI's Raid on Mar-a-Lago the Biggest In-Kind Contribution to Trump's 2024 Bid?"" a Townhall column by Matt Vespa asked, while HotAir's Ed Morrissey asked, ""Are they trying to hand Donald Trump the nomination in 2024?""

Others suggested the raid had only clinched his desire to seek the White House again.

Even straight news outlets framed the story as a potential boon to Trump's White House run, which he's hinted at for months.

""Donald Trump has given every signal that he’s running for president in 2024. The FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida on Monday may only harden his resolve to jump in the race — and possibly speed up the timetable,"" NBC News reported.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, R., was among the potential 2024 candidates who expressed support for Trump after news of the raid broke.

Former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home was raided by the FBI Monday morning in an unprecedented move by the bureau, and one connected to an investigation into records Trump allegedly took with him from the White House to his private residence when he left office in January 2021.

Earlier this year, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) said Trump took 15 boxes of presidential records to his personal residence in Florida. Those boxes allegedly contained ""classified national security information,"" and official correspondence between Trump and foreign heads of state.

NARA notified Congress in February that the agency recovered the 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago and ""identified items marked as classified national security information within the boxes.""

The National Archives and Records Administration describes itself as ""the nation's record keeper.""

""Of all documents and materials created in the course of business conducted by the United States federal government, only 1%-3% are so important for legal or historical reasons that they are kept by us forever,"" the NARA website states.

FBI RAIDS TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO: 'UNPRECEDENTED' FOR AGENCY TO EXECUTE SEARCH WARRANT AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT

The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires presidential administrations to preserve certain documents.

Under the law, all White House staff must copy or forward any presidential records created on non-official electronic messaging accounts to their official electronic messaging account within 20 days of leaving office.

According to a 2017 memorandum issued by the White House counsel's office under the Trump administration, ""any employee who intentionally fails to take these actions may be subject to administrative or even criminal penalties.""

Trump, earlier this year, said the National Archives didn’t ""find"" the documents, but that they were ""given, upon request.""

""The National Archives did not ‘find’ anything, they were given, upon request, Presidential Records in an ordinary and routine process to ensure the preservation of my legacy and in accordance with the Presidential Records Act,"" Trump said in a statement at the time, adding that Democrats ""are in search of their next Scam.""

The matter was referred to the Justice Department by NARA.

Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA 'UNDER SIEGE' BY FBI AGENTS

The FBI’s raid of Mar-a-Lago took place early Monday morning, when Trump was in New York City.

An FBI source confirmed that FBI agents from Washington, D.C., who are on the bureau's Evidence Response Team, conducted the raid and notified the Miami Field Office just before.

Per standard protocol, FBI Director Chris Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland were aware of the raid even if shortly before and would have been fully briefed.

A White House official told Fox News it did not have any notice of the reported action and referred all additional questions to the DOJ.

A source familiar told Fox News that agents brought a ""safe cracker"" and cracked a ""relatively new"" safe in Mar-a-Lago. The source told Fox News there was ""nothing in it.""

A source familiar told Fox News that FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago and looked in every single office and safe, and grabbed documents and boxes without going through them on the property. They took boxes and documents to go through them later.

""They were not being judicious about what they took,"" the source told Fox News.

GOP SLAMS 'WEAPONIZATION' OF DOJ AFTER TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RAIDED BY FBI; DEMS CALL IT 'ACCOUNTABILITY'

Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz said FBI agents likely seized documents without inquiring if they were classified, declassified or personal to Trump.

""The Justice Department had no right to seize them indiscriminately because some may not be classified and others may be classified above their level,"" he said. ""There are things that have been declassified by the president, which the Justice Department doesn't know about.""

Dershowitz slammed the unprecedented raid of the former president’s home, and questioned the bureau’s decision to execute a search warrant, rather than issue a subpoena for the records in question.

""There was no reason not to issue a subpoena returnable tomorrow, so that there's no claim that Trump could've destroyed anything,"" Dershowitz told Fox News. ""This should've been a subpoena, not a search warrant.""

He added: ""If it is a search warrant, it has to have a high level of cause demonstrating that the evidence would have been destroyed.""

Legal scholars note that when individuals previously violated the law regarding classified documents, the Justice Department has opted to either not prosecute or settle for lesser charges.

""The Presidential Records Act is not commonly a subject of criminal prosecution, even in the most egregious cases,"" said Jonathan Turley, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. ""These incidents have generally been handled administratively.""

Trump made the raid public Monday evening, saying in a lengthy statement that ""nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.""

""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said. ""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections.""

""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before,"" Trump said.

""What is the difference between this and Watergate, where operatives broke into the Democrat National Committee?"" he continued. ""Here, in reverse, Democrats broke into the home of the 45th President of the United States."""

Senior correspondent Laura Ingle hosts this multi-part Fox Nation Audio podcast that examines the unsolved murder mystery of the more than ten people, many of them sex workers, found on Long Island.

On a December morning more than a decade ago, a police dog stumbled across a set of female human remains on the south shore of Long Island, New York, along the edge of Ocean Parkway in Gilgo Beach. Law enforcement soon discovered the remains of three more women, stuffed in burlap bags found in thick bramble off a stretch of highway.

Months later, the body of 24-year-old sex worker Shannan Gilbert was also discovered near Oak Beach, not far from the “Gilgo Four,”. Also found were the dismembered remains of other women, a man dressed in female clothing, and a toddler, scattered in various locations throughout Long Island. Investigators announced that a serial killer (or killers) was to blame for the murders. But to this day, no suspects have been publicly named and no arrests have been made in a case that shook a quiet, sleepy beach town to its core, and captivated the nation.

In this Fox Nation series/Fox Audio podcast, produced by Fox News’ Investigative Unit, find out what law enforcement is currently doing to solve the case using new technology. You’ll learn new details from a former escort who believes she spoke with the Long Island serial killer. And hear from an investigator who helped solve the Golden State Killer case and what he believes can be done to lead to capture of the killer."

Why? Well it’s not hard to figure out. Law enforcement has never been an easy job but when you take that, add the defund and demonize movement, plus felon coddling policies like so-called “bail reform” and mix in Democrat politicians who have turned their backs on officers, this is what you get.

And it’s not just companies. Athletes, entertainers, and public figures alike fall all over themselves to placate China meanwhile, out of the other side of their mouths, they trash the USA as “oppressive!”

The irony and the hypocrisy is thicker than 2 layers of chocolate covered nugget!

What does this mean for 2024 and the future of the GOP?

With 69% of anonymous online ballots, Donald Trump easily won the CPAC Texas straw poll beating out Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by A LOT.

DeSantis received just under 24% support, that’s lower than his 28% at CPAC Orlando earlier this spring, and quite frankly, this astounds me.

Just a couple months back and for the second year in a row DeSantis defeated Trump in Colorado’s Western Conservative Summit straw poll.

Does this mean Donald Trump is getting more popular, or could it be just a Texas thing?

Either way, we are in for quite the showdown if both DeSantis and Trump throw their hats in for the next election.

The two conservative heavy weights are by far- and quite frankly the only- strong contenders for the GOP 2024 nomination, though neither one has officially announced.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, I am a proud Trump supporter BUT I would like to see DeSantis as our ’24 nominee.

My hope is that Trump puts his ego aside and goes all in for DeSantis.

But let’s be honest, whether it’s Ron OR Don, anything is better than Joe BRANDON!

A pivotal showdown for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in battleground Wiscons takes center stage on Tuesday, as four states from New England to the upper Midwest hold primaries.

The fight for Wisconsin’s GOP gubernatorial nomination between former conservative Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and businessman Tim Michels is the latest test of GOP clout between former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence, one-time running mates who could potentially face-off against each other for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

Kleefisch and MIchels are the front-runners in a field of four Republican candidates that also includes state lawmaker Timothy Ramthun. The GOP primary winner will face off in November with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who faces no primary challenge but who’s being heavily targeted by Republicans as he seeks a second term.

Michels is a multimillionaire owner of a construction company who in early June was endorsed by Trump. Two weeks ago, Pence once again broke with his former boss as he backed Kleefisch.

KLEEFISCH LANDS ANOTHER HIGH PROFILE CONSERVATIVE ENDORSEMENT

""There is no candidate for governor in America that is more capable, more experienced or a more proven conservative than Rebecca Kleefisch,"" Pence said as he teamed up with the former lieutenant governor at a campaign stop in suburban Milwaukee on Wednesday.

And Kleefisch touted that she's ""tested and proven and ready to go,"" and that she's ""the one who has won statewide four times.""

Two days later, as he headlined a rally for Michels in Waukesha, Trump charged that ""Rebecca Kleefisch does not have what it takes to beat Tony Evers… He's going to win if he runs against Rebecca.""

AFTER SNUB FROM TRUMP, KLEEFISCH VOWS SHE'LL WIN WISCONSIN'S GOP GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY

Asked by reporters on the eve of the primary for comments Trump’s derogatory attacks, Kleefisch responded: ""No thoughts that I can share.""

And she seemed to discount Trump’s endorsement of Michels as she emphasized in a Fox News interview on Monday that ""the voters of Wisconsin are going to be the ones who determine the outcome of this race.""

Michels’ campaign attempted to frame Kleefisch as a never Trumper, writing in an email to supporters on primary eve that ""if we don’t get Trump supporters to the polls to vote for Tim Michels on Tuesday, the Never Trumpers will win."" And Michel’s campaign argued that if Kleefisch wins, ""the media will falsely report Wisconsinites have rejected Trump’s endorsement.""

Michels has also spent big bucks to run ads targeting Kleefisch, while the former lieutenant governor has criticized Michels - who owns a home in Connecticut - as a part-time Wisconsin resident.

HEAD TO THE FOX NEWS ELECTIONS CENTER FOR THE LATEST PRIMARY RESULTS

The candidate Trump backed in last week’s GOP gubernatorial primary in Arizona, former TV news anchor Kari Lake, narrowly edged real estate developer and Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson, who was supported by Pence.

But in May, conservative Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, who was endorsed by Pence, trounced his Trump-backed challenger, former Sen. David Perdue, in the state’s GOP gubernatorial primary.

Besides Pence, two other potential 2024 GOP White House hopefuls, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former South Carolina governor and former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, endorsed Kleefisch this summer. Haley campaigned with the former lieutenant governor and helped her raise roughly $100,000.

In Wisconsin’s high profile Senate race — one of a handful across the country that will likely determine if the Republicans win back the chamber’s majority in November — GOP Sen. Ron Johnson is being heavily targeted by Democrats. Johnson faces a lone long-shot primary challenge on Tuesday from educator David Schroeder

Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes is his party’s all-but-certain Senate nominee on Tuesday, after his leading rivals dropped out of the race in recent weeks and endorsed him. Barnes is also backed by national progressive champions such as Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Barnes is part of a primary field that also includes four lesser-known Democrats.

President Biden narrowly carried Wisconsin as he won the 2020 election, and on Friday at his rally, Trump blasted Republican state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos for not embracing his unproven claims that his 2020 loss to Biden was due to massive voter fraud.

While Vos — who’s the state’s longest serving Assembly speaker — launched a controversial investigation into the 2020 election in Wisconsin and took a lead in passing a series of bills that tightened voting access in the state, he’s resisted Trump’s repeated calls to try and decertify the 2020 election results.

Minnesota

Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota faces a long shot primary challenge as he seeks a second term. Three Republicans are running in their party’s primary, including doctor and former state Sen. Scott Jenson, who landed the state GOP’s endorsement.

There's a special election on Tuesday in the state's primarily rural 1st Congressional District, along the state's southern border with Iowa, to fill the seat left vacant after GOP Rep. Jim Hagedorn died of cancer in February. The winner will serve the remainder of Hagedorn's term through the end of the year.

But complicating matters is that this isn't the only election in the district. There's also the reguarly scheduled primary

In the state’s Minneapolis-centric 5th Congressional District, progressive first-term Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, a member of the ""Squad,"" is facing four primary challengers. One of them — former Minneapolis City Councilman Don Samuels — is endorsed by a handful of former Minnesota mayors and has spotlighted his law enforcement support while criticizing Omar for pushing to dismantle the city’s police department.

In Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District, in the Twin Cities southern suburbs, all eyes are on November’s general election, when Democratic incumbent Rep. Angie Craig and 2020 GOP nominee Tyler Kistner will face off in a rematch.

Connecticut

Three Republicans are running in Tuesday’s Senate GOP primary in Connecticut, with the winner facing off in November against Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal. They are former state House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, businesswoman Leora Levy and businessman Peter Lumai.

It’s been 40 years since a Republican won a Senate election in the blue state of Connecticut.

""They were not being judicious about what they took,"" the source told Fox News.

Trump made the raid public Monday evening, saying in a lengthy statement that ""nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.""

""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said. ""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections.""

Multiple White House staffers and Democrats have taken to social media attempting to rebrand President Biden as ""dark Brandon"" amid a series of legislative victories.

""Dark Brandon is crushing it,"" Andrew Bates, the White House deputy press secretary, tweeted Sunday evening along with an image of Biden with laser eyes.

""Your malarkey has been going on for long enough, kiddo,"" read the image's caption.

Bates then tweeted another meme with the captions ""the malarkey will end"" and ""the dark Brandon rises"" in response to a tweet criticizing his initial post. The image appeared to depict Biden as Batman.

REPUBLICANS SAY DEMOCRATS WILL ‘PAY THE PRICE’ IN MIDTERMS FOR PASSING MASSIVE SPENDING BILL

But conservatives pointed out that the second image tweeted by Bates included eagle imagery resembling the logo used by the Nazi Party in the 1930s.

""Personally, I'm not surprised that you're tweeting out Nazi eagle imagery of your boss who reminisces about his segregationist 'mentor,'"" Abigail Marone, a spokesperson for Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., tweeted.

""'Dark Brandon' started as Chinese propaganda and then the White House co-opted it using Nazi Eagle imagery..."" Alec Sears, a digital staffer at the Republican National Committee, tweeted. ""They're not sending their best.""

""In 2020, the Trump campaign faced a week of stories and fact checks about a t-shirt with an eagle on it,"" Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for former President Trump's 2020 campaign, tweeted. ""Let’s see if a tweet from an official Biden White House account gets the same treatment.""

However, the apparent creator of the image said Monday that the image was never intended to be the ""Reichsadler"" seen in Nazi imagery, in an interview with The Washington Post. He said it was instead meant to represent a bald eagle.

The White House suggested the Nazi imagery allegation originated from Jack Posobiec, a conservative commentator linked to conspiracy theories.

""Who could have guessed that some Pizzagate/QAnon guy lies?"" Bates told Fox News Digital in an email. ""Have y’all seen this, though?""

Bates then pointed to a tweet Monday containing allegations from Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that former President Trump insisted U.S. generals be more like ""German generals in World War II.""

The ""Dark Brandon"" moniker appears to have started on Twitter in March among anonymous Biden supporters seeking to create an ""edgy"" version of the president, according to an online meme database. The meme also seeks to co-opt the ""let's go Brandon"" meme that originated among conservatives online and has become popular for those that oppose the Biden administration's agenda.

In addition, Rob Flaherty, the White House director of digital strategy, tweeted an image of Biden with laser eyes. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., also appeared to parrot the ""dark Brandon"" meme, posting an animation of Biden without pupils without a caption Sunday.

Megan Apper, who left the White House earlier this year to join the State Department, joined in on the ""Dark Brandon"" tweets, tweeting, ""Dark Brandon said ‘here’s the deal’ and then there was a deal.""

The apparent rebranding of Biden comes after several victories Democrats said showed the president has been successful overcoming gridlock on Capitol Hill.

In June, Biden signed a gun control bill that incentivizes states to approve red flag laws and introduce increased background checks, and last week, Biden signed the $280 billion Chips and Science Act, which boosts funding for the domestic semiconductor supply chain.

And, on Sunday, the Senate approved the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping budget reconciliation package that would introduce new green energy incentives and attempt to lower pharmaceutical prices.

""For decades, the gun lobby and the oil companies and the drug industry controlled Washington. And ordinary people suffered,"" Murphy tweeted. ""And [sic] then, in one summer, all that changed. The first gun safety bill in 30 years. Historic climate change legislation. Caps on drug costs. Just wow.""

However, conservatives were quick to criticize Democrats claiming victory and rebranding Biden as ""dark Brandon.""

""You can try to Dark Brandon meme your way out of sub-40 approval ratings all you want, but throwing hundreds of billions at green boondoggles in the middle of an inflationary spiral isn't going to turn things around,"" conservative commentator Ben Shapiro tweeted Monday.

The traveling nurse from Texas charged over a fiery car crash in a Los Angeles neighborhood that left six people dead, including a pregnant mother on the way to a prenatal checkup and a baby, was involved in more than a dozen prior wrecks, according to prosecutors.

Nicole Linton, 37, of Houston, was charged on Monday with six counts of murder and five counts of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence.

The announcement came after she allegedly barreled a Mercedes down La Brea Avenue on Aug. 4 at high speeds before running a red light and crashing into several vehicles in the Windsor Hills neighborhood, igniting a fiery wreck seen on surveillance cameras.

Prosecutors alleged that Linton had been involved in 13 car crashes — both in and out of the state of California — before Thursday’s wreck, the Los Angeles Times reported. They noted one in 2020 involved bodily injury and two cars being totaled but did not elaborate with more information.

Linton’s attorney, Halim Dhanidina, requested that the arraignment be continued until October to allow time to review the nurse’s out-of-state history of ""documented profound mental health issues,"" according to the Times.

Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón said Monday that so far evidence does not suggest Linton was under the influence of alcohol but investigations into the cause of the crash remain active.

Those killed included 23-year-old Asherey Ryan, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant, her 11-month-old son and Ryan’s boyfriend. Two other women, who have yet to be identified, in another vehicle also were killed. Six other vehicles were involved in the collision, including five people with minor injuries in an SUV and another driver in another vehicle, according to prosecutors. The case remains under investigation by the California Highway Patrol.

""Today, we begin the process of holding accountable the person responsible for the deaths of six people, including a pregnant woman, and their families,"" Gascón said in a statement. ""This is a case that will always be remembered for the senseless loss of so many innocent lives as they simply went about their daily routines. I want to thank our prosecutors and the investigating officers at the California Highway Patrol for their work on this case.""

""While the wreckage of this fiery crash at this intersection was removed and traffic eventually resumed, there is catastrophic damage to the families and friends of those killed and injured,"" he added. ""It is not only a tremendous loss to the families but our entire community who learned of this incredible tragedy or have watched the now viral video of the collision. I’m sure this is a time of great sorrow and grieving for the families and friends of those who will be forever affected by what has transpired.""

Linton reportedly had been working as a nurse at Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Medical Center. After the crash, she was hospitalized at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center over the weekend and was being held on $2 million bail. She was released from the hospital Monday and her bail was increased to $9 million.

A massive search effort was underway Tuesday morning for the missing California 16-year-old Kiely Rodni, who vanished after telling family she was going to head home from a high school graduation sendoff early Saturday.

The Placer County Sheriff’s Office has said they were investigating a possible abduction because the girl’s SUV was also unaccounted for. Rodni graduated from high school two years early, and it is unlike her to run away or fail to come home, according to her mother, Lindsey Rodni-Nieman

A spokesperson told Fox News Digital Tuesday that investigators were still ""exploring all possibilities"" and confirmed that teens were using alcohol and drugs at the party.

Rodni had enough drinks to become drunk, according to her friend and another recent graduate, Sami Smith, who added that she did not believe the teen would have driven under the circumstances.

""At the point when I left, I thought she was going to stay there,"" said Smith, who departed the campground just a few minutes before Rodni was last seen. ""Everybody was camping. It was late enough that she should have stayed. She’s not the type to go and drunk drive or anything.""

Smith said she spent most of the night with Rodni.

""For the amount of drinks we both had together, she’s not that dumb,"" she added. ""I remember we were partying together. She was having fun. She seemed really happy -- she was like normal, just on an adrenaline rush. Saying ‘Hi’ to everybody.

But Rodni-Nieman, says her daughter texted her around 12:15 a.m. Saturday and said she was heading home. The family lives about 10 miles away from the campground at a lodge south of town.

Smith, 18, said that there were plenty of attendees whom she had not previously met, but none who seemed suspicious, gave unwanted attention or followed the pair around.

She said she didn’t notice anyone much older and that the party consisted mainly of teens, recent graduates and some college students from the surrounding areas. Some came from as far away as San Francisco, she said, but that was not unusual because the area is a summer vacation town.

""We met a few strangers together,"" she said. ""We both tended to trust people, I say tended to because now I don’t think I will continue to trust people. But she’ll give anyone the benefit of the doubt.""

Search crews and police from multiple counties scoured through the area beginning early Tuesday morning.

They started by searching Lake Prosser by boat as the land-based search party gathered on the shoreline.

Several aircraft, including helicopters and airplanes flying in formation above, all-terrain vehicles ranging including four-wheelers, trikes and dirt bikes. There were canines present and at least 100 members of law enforcement visible, including members of the FBI, who initially focused their attention on Campsite 4.

Crews pulled the boats from the water around noon and FBI agents were seen knocking on doors in the area. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""Right now, we are currently searching many areas,"" said Angela Musallam, the Placer County Sheriff’s public information officer.

The party, which stretched from Friday night into Saturday morning at the Prosser Family Campground in the Tahoe National Forest, involved dozens or hundreds of kids from a handful of nearby communities in the rural area, including Truckee, North Lake.

Around 12:15 a.m., she texted her parents that she was heading home. However, according to her mother, no one has come forward to say they saw her leave; no one was with her at the time; and nobody could remember when she left or seeing her car drive away.

Her phone, which last pinged at the party, has been turned off. Authorities say her vehicle, a silver 2013 Honda CRV with the California license plate 8YUR127, is also unaccounted for.

Authorities are urging teens who were at the party to come forward, and the community announced a ""Teen to Teen"" information gathering event from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. PT at the Tahoe City Save Mart in an effort to get attendees talking.

""We have had a lack of reach out from many Tahoe kids who were at the party or may know any information,"" the announcement reads. ""We are only looking for information such as who was at the party that you may have seen ad the times you came and left.""

Rodni’s mother is asking anyone who attended the party and their parents to look through their photos, social media posts and videos for any signs of Rodni. Home and business owners in the surrounding area are also asked to check their surveillance cameras for signs of the girl on Aug. 5 and 6.

""Please folks stop calling it a ‘raid,’"" she tweeted, later responding to critics in amusement.

Even former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo raised eyebrows on Twitter when he called on the Justice Department to justify the ""raid"" or else jeopardize other investigations like the one into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

MSNBC seemed to change tacks on Tuesday, with more hosts and reporters quoting Trump's ""raid"" language but mostly describing it as a search instead.

""What is a woman? What is a recession? What is a raid?"" Ted Cruz communications director Steve Guest asked mockingly.

Sanders isn't the only MSNBC personality to take exception to the term. As the news broke Monday, anchor Alicia Menendez asked former FBI agent Frank Figliuzzi how the FBI was able to ""pull off this raid."" Figliuzzi, a national security contributor at MSNBC, objected to her terminology during his answer.

""Agents don’t like the word ‘raid,’ they don’t like it. It sounds like it’s some sort of extrajudicial, non-legal thing. It’s an execution of a search warrant. It’s a court-authorized search warrant,"" he said.

Many print outlets used the term ""raid"" independently of Trump, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Associated Press, Reuters, CNBC, Politico and others.

Sources told Fox News on Tuesday that investigators from the Justice Department visited Mar-a-Lago in June for a meeting about turning over records as part of an investigation into documents former President Trump allegedly took with him from the White House to his private residence when he left office in January 2021.

Trump's attorneys were present at that meeting and the sources say the former president himself stopped in to say hello for a few minutes.

The meeting came months after the National Archives — with assistance from the Justice Department — was able to get 15 boxes of documents sent back to Washington, D.C., after expressing concern they were in Florida.

The June meeting was about additional documents that were being sought. But following it, the Justice Department and FBI felt they weren't getting the same cooperation they had been receiving earlier in the probe, according to a source with knowledge of negotiations between Trump's team and the federal entities.

The perceived lack of cooperation is why a search warrant was requested and ultimately executed on Monday, Aug. 8, at Trump's Palm Beach property.

Sanders resigned as a top aide to Harris last year and joined MSNBC, where she hosts the weekend program ""Symone."" She's been followed in that regard by former White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who stepped down in May and will soon have her own Peacock streaming show.

""The highest weight/BMI increase was observed in children with pre-existing overweight/obesity, of Hispanic and African American ethnicity, and in those living unfavorable socioeconomic conditions, therefore, most vulnerable to unhealthy lifestyle, food insecurity, family and social stress (i.e., lower parental psychological and educational support, and higher financial concerns/limitations), and with difficult access to academic resources and healthcare services,"" the study states.

DEMS, UNION LEADERS RESPONSIBLE FOR SCHOOL LOCKDOWNS FACE FEW REPERCUSSIONS, DESPITE EVIDENCE THAT KIDS HARMED

The study concluded that ""data analysis clearly demonstrated the detrimental impact of COVID-19 lockdown on children and adolescents’ body weight and BMI, children with pre-existing overweight/obesity being more at risk of gaining weight.""

The weight gain in children came as a result of homeschooling, sitting in front of screens like tablets and televisions, less physical activity, junk food and excessive eating, the study says.

COVID LOCKDOWNS MAY BE ENDING, BUT WE ARE FOREVER CHANGED

In addition, the study explained that ""the high levels of stress, fear and anxiety experienced by children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic could have contributed to weight increase during the lockdown.""

Those who struggled with increased weight gain and obesity as a result of the coronavirus lockdowns were also more likely to be hospitalized after contracting the virus, the study found.

""The COVID-19 pandemic had a huge impact on the health and well-being of children and adolescents. Lockdown measures affected healthy lifestyle behaviors through the modification of dietary habits, the reduction of physical activity and the alteration of sleep patterns, and also increased the levels of stress and anxiety, overall promoting weight gain and obesity,"" the study's conclusion reads.

The study backs up the findings of a CDC study last year that showed ""profound increase in weight gain for kids"" during the coronavirus lockdowns.

It found that an estimated 19% jump in childhood obesity during the lockdowns and that children who were a healthy weight were gaining an average of 3.4 pounds a year before the pandemic and 5.4 pounds during the pandemic.

The analysis, which is a conservative estimate based upon recent audit rates and tax filing data, shows that individuals with an annual income of $75,000 or less would be subject to 710,863 additional Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits while those making more than $1 million would receive 52,295 more audits under the bill. The legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, would roughly double the IRS' budget to increase enforcement and, therefore, federal tax revenue.

""Every retailer in the U.S. who cares about their hard-hit customers should be fighting to block this unnecessary harassment of hard-working Americans,"" he added.

Overall, the IRS would conduct more than 1.2 million more annual audits of Americans' tax returns, according to the analysis. Another 236,685 of the estimated additional audits would target individuals with an annual income between $75,000 and $200,000.

To boost tax enforcement, the Inflation Reduction Act would appropriate more than $79 billion in additional funds to the IRS over the next decade, nearly doubling the agency's current budget. The IRS is expected to hire tens of thousands more agents to enhance enforcement efforts that are projected to increase revenue by $124 billion.

In response to criticism about the expected uptick in tax audits under the bill, IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said Thursday that ""audit rates"" will not increase relative to recent years.

The legislation doesn't explicitly guarantee that Americans making under $400,000 won't see tax increases under the IRS provision. The bill states that it is not ""intended"" to increase rates for taxpayers who aren't in the top 1% of earners.

""There is language in this bill that provides some guidelines, but it's not at all a guarantee,"" William McBride, the vice president of federal tax and economic policy at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, told FOX Business in an interview. ""It indicates that the intent of the increased spending is not to target those earning less than $400,000. But intent is a somewhat squishy word.""

""The fact of the matter is most returns report income under $100,000,"" he continued. ""That's where the money is, so to speak.""

McBride added that middle-class Americans aren't able to afford the same resources as wealthy individuals to avoid scrutiny.

The FBI raid on former President Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago has unleashed a familiar euphoria among critics who have longed for the scene of agents descending upon the president's residence in a criminal operation.

One MSNBC pundit declared on Monday night, after the news of the raid broke, that day of the ""orange jumpsuit"" may finally be at hand while another simply exclaimed ""hallelujah."" It was a tad premature since we do not even know if classified material was found and, if so, whether there is a criminal case to be made from such a discovery.

I previously testified in Congress on the earlier seizure of the boxes at Mar-a-Lago under the Presidential Records Act and how criminal prosecutions have been rare under the law. Nevertheless, criminal charges are possible, including under Section 2071 which states that anyone who ""willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates or destroys … any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited … in any public office."" That crime, however, requires a showing of not just negligence but ""an act is ... done voluntarily and intentionally and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids.""

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA 'UNDER SIEGE' BY FBI AGENTS

Notably, even the most serious cases of mishandling classified records have not resulted in major charges. One example is that of former Clinton National Security Adviser Sandy Berger who was found to have secretly stuffed classified material into his pants and socks to remove them from a secure facility. He then hid them in a spot to be retrieved later. It was a flagrant and premeditated violation of federal law and put national security secrets at risk.

Yet, Berger was allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and did not have to serve any jail time. Indeed, his security clearance was suspended for only three years.

However, critics were not particularly interested in whether Trump might have some suspended misdemeanor sentence. Rather, even before learning if any evidence of criminal conduct was found, critics turned to the ability to use the charge to disqualify Trump from future office.

Section 2071 has excited the imagination of such critics because of a line that states that a convicted party can ""be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.""

That enticing possibility has already been highlighted by Marc Elias, Hillary Clinton's campaign lawyer who was a critical player in pushing the false Russian collusion claims in the Steele dossier. In addition to accusations that he may have lied about the funding of the Steele dossier, Elias has been sanctioned in court for his conduct representing Democratic causes.

RAID ON TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO HOME BY BIDEN'S POLITICIZED FBI MEANS US NOW A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY

Yet, Elias was not alone citing the possible use of a Section 2071 charge to block Trump's expected presidential run in 2024. Former federal prosecutor Harry Litman even suggested that this could be the actual plan of the Justice Department to end Trump's political career: ""So this could be the whole enchilada in terms of DOJ resolution.""

Consider that culinary-legal analysis for a second. The claim is that the Justice Department may be actively seeking to use a charge to block Trump as the real motivation for this raid and possible charge. There is not a hint of concern over the FBI being used to achieve such a political purpose. That is putting aside the fact that, unless there is evidence of a ""willful and unlawful"" effort to conceal or retain such material, the FBI could end up an enchilada short of a combination plate for prosecution.

There is also a significant constitutional hurdle facing this latest means of barring Trump from office. This is not the first time that this disqualification argument has been made and scholars have previously raised constitutional objections to it.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

The problem is that the law would add a qualification or condition that is not stated in the Constitution. There are constitutional ways to impeach a president or to bar a former president from future office. The mishandling of official records is not one of them.

In analogous cases like Powell v. McCormack and U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, the Supreme Court rejected the authority of states to impose new qualifications for congressional seats under Article I. The same is presumably true under Article II when it comes to the chief executive.

There is ample reason to doubt that the presidency would be deemed barred by statute in this fashion. What would not be in doubt is how such a novel claim of disqualification would be received by millions of citizens already skeptical of the motivations of both the Biden administration and specifically the FBI.

The basis and even the motivation of this raid will become clear in time, including whether there is evidence of willful and unlawful conduct by the former president. However, whatever this raid produces, this ""enchilada"" will likely be hard for most judges to swallow as a way to keeping Trump off the ballot in 2024.

One year ago, millions of Americans watched chaos unfold in Afghanistan as the Taliban took hold amid President Biden's ordered withdrawal of all American forces. Thousands of Americans and Afghan allies rushed to leave the country, but many are still left behind.

U.S. Army combat veteran Alex Plitsas reflected on the rescue efforts on ""America's Newsroom"" Tuesday and reunited with former U.S. forces interpreter Abdul Wali Sidiqui, who was saved by Operation ""Digital Dunkirk.""

""[Federal officials] were given a very difficult and nearly impossible mission,"" Plitsas told co-host Dana Perino.

Marc Elias, a top lawyer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, said Monday that former President Trump could be disqualified from making another run at the White House in 2024 following the FBI raid of his Florida residence.

FBI agents executed a search warrant of Trump's Mar-a-Lago property on Monday reportedly seeking classified documents he allegedly took from the White House when he left office in 2021. The search warrant was conducted in connection with the National Archives, according to a senior government official.

This led Elias to cite U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2071 to highlight that Trump could be barred from seeking public office again, as the former president continues to drop hints that he will soon announce plans to seek a second term as commander-in-chief.

""The media is missing the really, really big reason why the raid today is a potential blockbuster in American politics,"" Elias wrote in a tweet.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA ‘UNDER SEIGE’ BY FBI AGENTS

Elias pointed to the passage of U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2071 that states, ""Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.""

However, legal challenges could make efforts to prevent Trump from running again under this code difficult, Elias noted in a follow-up tweet.

""Yes, I recognize the legal challenge that application of this law to a president would garner (since qualifications are set in Constitution). But the idea that a candidate would have to litigate this is during a campaign is in my view a ‘blockbuster in American politics,’"" he wrote.

The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires presidential administrations to preserve certain documents.

According to the National Archives, the presidential records in 15 boxes taken from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year include documents classified over national security concerns.

GOP SLAMS 'WEAPONIZATION' OF DOJ AFTER TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RAIDED BY FBI; DEMS CALL IT 'ACCOUNTABILITY'

The agency has also called on the Department of Justice to probe whether the former president violated federal law in his handling of records.

""Because [the National Archives and Records Administration] identified classified information in the boxes, NARA staff has been in communication with the Department of Justice,"" then-U.S. archivist David Ferriero wrote in a letter to Congress.

Trump released a statement Monday announcing the FBI's raid and he slammed the federal government for its search of his property.

""Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before,"" Trump wrote. ""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate.""

""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections,"" he continued, adding that ""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries.""

A West Virginia University study found that the population of youth who do not identify with their sex at birth may be much higher than previous estimates.

""Gender-diverse youth are incredible young people, and — as our study found — many of them live in rural areas,"" WVU School of Medicine researcher Dr. Kacie Kidd, one of the co-authors of the study, said in a press release Monday. ""It is important that we ensure they have access to support so that they are able to thrive.""

Kidd's comments come after researchers at the university anonymously surveyed close to 3,000 students in grades 7-12 in Appalachian region public schools, finding that more than 7% of respondents identified with a gender other than their sex at birth.

The findings follow a 2017 UCLA study that found West Virginia had the highest per capita rate of transgender youth in the country, estimating that just over 1% of the state's youth identified with a gender other than their sex at birth. The WVU findings suggest that the 2017 study may have severely underestimated that number, which researchers say may be due to the lack of ability to reach youth in rural areas.

CONSERVATIVES ACCUSE TRANS ACTIVIST OF ILLEGALLY SENDING HORMONE ‘DRUGS TO CHILDREN,' CITING SOCIAL MEDIA

Kidd pointed to research she previously worked on that surveyed young people in Pittsburgh, which found that nearly 10% of youth in the Appalachian city had a ""gender-diverse identity.""

""Despite the high prevalence of gender-diverse identities found in our Pittsburgh study, information about rural areas was still unknown,"" Kidd said. ""We suspect that many of the young people in rural Appalachia who shared their gender-diverse identities with us in this study may benefit from additional support, especially if they do not feel seen and supported at home and in their community.""

Kidd pointed out that the numbers could raise issues for public health officials, noting that gender-diverse youth are at increased risk of mental health disorders, suicide, and depression.

""Adolescent mental health is at a crisis point, according to the Centers for Disease Control,"" Kidd said. ""We have an access concern because so many young people need mental health services nationwide and we just don’t have enough mental health professionals to meet that need. It’s a growing problem and certainly gender-diverse youth are at an even greater risk.""

CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL TRANSGENDER YOUTH CENTER CATERS TO PATIENTS AS YOUNG AS AGE 3

The research also comes as the state has been battling a lawsuit filed in 2020 against the state's ban on using Medicaid for transgender surgical procedures.

According to a ruling last week by District Court Judge Robert C. Chambers, the state's exclusion of gender transition surgeries for the treatment of gender dysphoria ""invidiously discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status.""

West Virginia is one of nine states with Medicaid rules that exclude covering transgender medical interventions, though officials in Ohio say their state's ban is not enforced and an Arkansas ban only applies to minors. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration is currently considering a similar exclusion on covering transgender medical interventions such as puberty blockers, hormones, gender transition surgeries or ""any other procedures that alter primary or secondary sexual characteristics,"" according to reporting from The Hill.

The minimum book tax would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income.
The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.","The sweeping climate, health care and tax bill that Senate Democrats passed Sunday includes one of the biggest tax hikes in decades, including a new levy for corporations that repurchase their own stock.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which passed along party lines with Democrats employing the budget reconciliation process, would raise an estimated $739 billion over the next decade, with the revenues going toward initiatives designed to combat climate change and curb pharmaceutical prices, as well as efforts to reduce the nation's $30 trillion debt.

It includes about $433 billion in new spending, while roughly $300 billion of the new revenue raised would go toward paying down the nation's deficit.

Some of the main revenue raisers stem from new levies on wealthy businesses, including a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases that is poised to take effect in 2023. Democrats, who estimated this new levy will raise about $74 billion over the next decade, are hoping to slow companies' tendency to buy back their own stock from investors with the tax.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT: WHAT TAX HIKES ARE IN THE BILL?

Companies have been allowed to buy their own shares since 1982, and the practice has since become commonplace on Wall Street. In 2019, stock buybacks hit a record $1 trillion, according to the SEC. Buybacks already hit a record $281 billion in the first three months of 2022, according to S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt. Although they were down 17.4% in the second quarter.

""I hate stock buybacks,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""I think they are one of the most self-serving things that corporate America does.""

The bill also imposes a 15% minimum tax on corporations based on profits they publicly report on their financial statements to shareholders. The minimum book tax would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income. Democrats said the levy would affect around 200 of the country's largest corporations with profits exceeding $1 billion and that pay less than the current 21% rate for businesses.

Experts expect the two taxes to drag on 2023 earnings, with Goldman Sachs forecasting a 1.5% decline per share of S&P 500 companies. The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.

UBS strategists led by Solita Marcelli, meanwhile, projected the new taxes would have a ""very minimal 1% drag on S&P 500 earnings per share, although some companies will be more affected than others.""

Josh Wilson, 40, was driving back to his hotel with his wife and son when he stopped at a gas station in Myrtle Beach, SC. While filling up, a man approached and asked for a ride. Josh agreed to pick him up after he'd dropped off his family at the hotel.

""I didn’t think anything of it because he does it all the time,"" his wife, Staci Wilson, told The Sun News. ""He was always kind to everybody. It didn’t matter if you were homeless, a struggling addict, if you was rich. He was nice and he tried to help out everybody and that’s how we got in this situation.""

Staci says Wilson left shortly after dropping her off at the hotel, but never returned. Police say Wilson's passenger allegedly shot him, causing him to crash the vehicle.

Police found Wilson inside his vehicle at roughly 1 a.m. Sunday after responding to reports of gunfire. He was rushed to the hospital and put on life support, but died Tuesday.

Police have not announced any suspects in the shooting, and say there was no sign of the passenger when they found Wilson's vehicle.

""I am trying to stay strong for the kids,"" Staci told the Sun. ""I went to the beach with my husband and came back alone. He died a day before my birthday. People were telling me happy birthday, but I don’t care. I honestly never want to celebrate it again.""

Staci and Wilson were set to celebrate their one-year wedding anniversary on October 16, according to the Sun.

President Biden signed documents backing the entry of Sweden and Finland into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Tuesday.

""Putin thought he could break us apart… weaken our resolve,"" Biden said during a news conference announcing U.S. ratification of expanding NATO to include Finland and Sweden. ""Instead, he’s getting exactly what he did not want. He wanted the Findalization [Finland-ization] of NATO, but he’s getting the NATO-ization of Finland.""

Before signing the documents, Biden touted the expansion as a ""watershed moment"" that would enhance the security of ""not only Europe and the United States, but of the world.""

Biden urged the rest of the NATO allies to quickly ratify the expansion as well, noting the shared values Finland and Sweden have with the 30-member alliance.

""Sweden and Finland have strong democratic institutions, strong militaries, and strong and transparent economies that will meet every NATO requirement,"" the president said.

Finland and Sweden's membership will be the first significant expansion of the alliance since the Soviet Union's collapse in the 1990s. Their acceptance into the bloc marks a rebuke to Russia amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The Senate approved the move in a rare showing of bipartisan support, voting 95-1 last week in favor of the expansion. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was the only senator to vote against the measure, arguing that it would take focus away from China, which he considers America's primary geopolitical foe.

""We can do more in Europe... devote more resources, more firepower ... or do what we need to do to deter Asia and China. We cannot do both,"" Hawley said, according to the Associated Press.

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell welcomed the news, arguing that the move would boost national security.

""Their accession will make NATO stronger and America more secure. If any senator is looking for a defensible excuse to vote no, I wish them good luck,"" McConnell said.

Biden immediately signalled his support for the measure after the Senate vote.

""I look forward to signing the accession protocols and welcoming Sweden and Finland, two strong democracies with highly capable militaries, into the greatest defensive alliance in history,"" Biden said in a statement last week after the Senate overwhelmingly approved their membership.

Finland and Sweden's application to join NATO came in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, with membership in the alliance being strongly opposed by the Kremlin.

NATO's 30 current member-states signed the accession protocol for the two countries last month, clearing the way for the members to formally ratify their membership.

All 30 current NATO members must ratify the decision to allow Finland and Sweden's membership before they can be protected by Article Five of the NATO Charter, which states an attack on one NATO country is an attack on all members.

CNN legal analyst Paul Callan called the Justice Department's raid on former President Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago home a ""daring and dangerous move"" that was ""not warranted"" if it was only about Trump holding onto classified documents after his time in office.

During CNN’s ""At This Hour with Kate Bolduan"" on Wednesday, the host spoke to legal analyst Paul Callan, who expressed hope that the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have something more serious on Trump than currents reports indicate, otherwise their raid on Trump’s massive West Palm Beach residence went too far.

Bolduan prompted Callan by bringing up speculation that the federal government conducted the raid to seize classified documents retained by the former president that he was not authorized to have after leaving the White House.

As Clinton 2016 campaign lawyer Marc Elias mused on Twitter Tuesday evening, Trump may have violated the Presidential Records Act of 1978, prompting the raid, and an ensuing investigation which could bar him from running for political office in the future.

Bolduan asked, ""If this becomes a Presidential Records Act violation, not more, do you think it’s enough to warrant all this?"" Callan responded that it’s not.

""No, it’s not enough to warrant all this,"" the legal analyst declared, adding, ""And this is a daring and dangerous move by the Department of Justice, to serve a warrant on a former president and raid his personal residence.""

Callan inferred that for the government to go this far, there must be ""something more"" than Trump merely holding onto classified documents after his term. ""So, I have to think that the Department of Justice must have something more than an argument about what kind of records have to be saved for a presidential library or the Library of Congress at some future date.""

""There’s more to this than meets the eye,"" Callan continued, adding, ""And I have to think that there’s something a lot more serious that they think is being withheld from the presidential collection.""

Former President Trump, who was in New York City during the time of the raid, condemned the action in a statement on Monday evening, calling it ""prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024.""

He added that ""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries.""

Other GOP leaders, including Governor Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., and former Vice President Mike Pence condemned the raid as well.

On Monday evening, the Florida governor tweeted, ""The raid of MAL [Mar-a-Lago] is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves. Now the Regime is getting another 87k IRS agents to wield against its adversaries? Banana Republic.""

After Maddow asked Schumer for his reaction to the breaking news, he said, ""I know nothing about it other than what I’ve read like everybody else, so I think it’s wise for me to withhold comment until we learn more.""

""Yes it would,"" Schumer agreed. After asking Schumer about the sprawling Inflation Reduction Act and working with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Maddow brought up the Mar-a-Lago raid again but noted that she understood he didn't want to talk about the substance of it.

""With the FBI raiding the president’s house today at Mar-a-Lago — and I know you don’t want to talk about that in substance — it seems clear, I think it seems obvious to both of us that we’re about to enter into a new and more intense area of the Republicans and the Trump-supporting Republicans really waging war on law enforcement and especially on the idea of federal law enforcement. And I wonder if you’ve been thinking strategically about that, about defending those institutions, defending that part of the executive branch that enforces federal law against the sort of politicized attacks that are coming their way?"" she asked.

BNPL INCLUSION IN CREDIT REPORTS CAUSES GROWING CONSUMER CONCERNS, SURVEY CLAIMS

Americans coping with rising prices

Inflation is currently surging and increased in June to a new 40-year high, marking the fifth time it's broken that record this year. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 9.1% annually in June, hitting its highest point since November 1981, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

Because of this, many consumers are needing to dip into their savings or fund their purchases with credit, according to data from Morning Consult Economic Intelligence . Intentions to buy big-ticket items such as electronics, trips and vacations, home appliances and furniture have all decreased over the past year.

But despite these setbacks, consumer balance sheets are historically strong, according to Morning Consult. Net wealth as a share of disposable income is currently near a record high as household debt as a share of total assets is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, according to data from the Federal Reserve.

Because of this, some consumers, especially from higher-income households, are actually increasing their spending and expected spending, according to the Morning Consult report. Households with an annual income of at least $50,000 reported a 25% increase in monthly spending from May 2021 to May 2022.

""To put it simply: People still have the means to buy things, but they are expecting items to cost more,"" the report stated. ""And Morning Consult data indicates that they’re using BNPL to pay for some of them. The consistency with which U.S. consumers have used BNPL to fund their purchases throughout 2022 indicates that the payment form may be helping to keep their price sensitivity and substitutions at bay, and should be viewed as an indicator of the staying power of BNPL.""

The use of BNPL payments is not slowing, and the share of adults who used BNPL to fund a purchase at least once in the past month has not dropped below 16% in 2022, according to Morning Consult’s report.

Adults with annual income between $50,000 and $99,999 as well as those with an annual income of $100,000 or more are even more likely to have used BNPL for a purchase over the past month at 21% and 20%, respectively.

And consumers expect to continue using BNPL.

""As more retailers partner with BNPL providers and more payment providers create their own BNPL offerings, adoption and strong usage will likely continue,"" the report stated.

Even as consumers purchase less big ticket items, they will continue to use BNPL for a wide variety of other purchases. Morning Consult’s report showed 35% of respondents used BNPL to purchase apparel, 32% used it to purchase electronics and 23% used it for footwear.

Across the country, librarians in schools and public libraries are stocking the shelves with material that is so pornographic that when parents have tried to read aloud and show the material at school board meetings, their microphones were cut off.

For progressives, the victim of the situation isn’t the children exposed to inappropriate content; the hero of the story isn’t the parents fighting for their kids’ innocence. No, the hero and victim of the coverage of these incidents are the librarians buying the sexually explicit content and recommending it to children.

Librarians are putting themselves on the front lines of a culture war, often shooting the first shots, and then bemoaning that they’ve found themselves under fire. But here’s the thing: Libraries have turned themselves into battlegrounds for these arguments, and librarians, one of the most radically progressive professions, have made them that way.

If you’re hosting drag queen story hour and stocking literal pornography on the shelves, you’ve surrendered the right to just ask for a quiet and respectful conversation about how you’re doing your job.

FLORIDA SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER DEMANDS ‘DISCIPLINARY ACTION’ OVER PORNOGRAPHIC BOOKS IN SCHOOLS: ‘I’M DISGUSTED'

How libraries are functioning is an assault on our children, paid for by our tax dollars. It’s long past time for parents to fight back, even if they’re called book banners for doing so. Librarians turned themselves into political warriors and are trying to make our kids into their foot soldiers. They don’t get to do so without a fight.

Progressives have received their talking points on the matter. Efforts on the part of parents to make sure that inappropriate and pornographic materials aren’t available to their children is called ""book banning."" In April, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., chairman of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, held a hearing to examine what he called ""the ongoing efforts across the country to ban books from schools and public libraries.""

A single mother of a middle schooler in Raskin’s district, Marilyn (who asked to be anonymous for professional reasons), shared with me her own story. She told me,

""My daughter started asking to go to the school early so she could spend some time in the library and came home with 'George' by Alex Gino. I had not heard of this book, and have yet to meet the school librarian. I asked my daughter if she picked out the book and she told me that the librarian gave it to her and said she thought she would like it. I still have no idea why.

""The school librarian also apparently said the same things about 'Rick' by Alex Gino. 'The Art of Being Normal' by Lisa Williamson also came home from the school library. These three books are the only books that came home from the school library in Montgomery County in 2021-2022.""

Gino’s book ""George,"" which has since been renamed ""Melissa,"" has been at the top of the American Library Association’s list of Top 10 Most Challenged Books for several years. The ALA, with its list, posit the book challenges are akin to censorship. Here’s a sample from ""George,"" just to get an idea of what many parents objected to:

""George stopped. It was such a short little question, but she couldn’t make her mouth form the sounds.

""Mom, what if I’m a girl?

""George had seen an interview on television a few months ago with a beautiful woman named Tina. She had golden-brown skin, thick hair with blond highlights, and long, sparkling fingernails. The interviewer said that Tina had been born a boy, then asked her whether she’d had the surgery. The woman replied that she was a transgender woman and that what she had between her legs was nobody’s business but hers and her boyfriends.

""So George knew it could be done. A boy could become a girl. She had since read on the Internet you could take girl hormones that would change your body, and you could get a bunch of different surgeries if you wanted them and had the money. This was called transitioning. You could even start before you were 18 with pills called adrogen blockers that stopped the boy hormones already inside you from turning your body into a man’s. But for that, you needed your parents’ permission.""

All you have to do is permanently mutiliate yourself with major surgery and hormone therapy; it’s as easy as taking antibiotics!

In 2021, Gino’s ""George / Melissa"" was finally getting knocked out of the top spot by a new book, ""Gender Queer,"" by Maia Kobabe. In its coverage of the ""book banning"" wars in the its Sunday newsletter, the New York Times interviewed Alexandra Alter, a Times reporter covering the publishing industry on the subject, and in its graphics illustrating the newsletter item, ""Gender Queer"" was one of the books highlighted.

Alter was asked, ""How are librarians responding?"" And Alexandra laid it on, thick with her reply, ""It’s heartbreaking for them.

President Joe Biden's foreign policy is a toxic mix of ideas from both extremes of the political spectrum.

On the one hand, Biden and company have embraced the Obama era policy of maximum restraint. The idea is that the less the U.S. engages in foreign affairs, the fewer problems it will have to deal with.

The problem with maximum restraint is that it can let a manageable foreign problem fester and grow into a tremendous problem. It’s like when a homeowner keeps putting off fixing a leaky roof; one day the ceiling will collapse.

WHITE HOUSE SUMMONS CHINESE AMBASSADOR AMID MILITARY EXERCISES, DIPLOMATIC RETALIATION FOR PELOSI TAIWAN VISIT

Maximum restraint can also lead to precipitous withdrawal from foreign engagements. This too can be disastrous. For example, Obama precipitously withdrew from Iraq, and ISIS promptly filled the vacuum. Biden did the same in Afghanistan, and we now know that Al Qaeda has already reestablished a foothold there.

The reality is: Whenever America walks away, our adversaries happily fill in. Just look at what happened at our southern border. As soon as Biden reversed all of Trump’s border security measures, the cartels started lining up people to come across.

On the other hand, Biden is often over-eager to engage on the world stage, turning American interests over to globalist management. The idea is that we can make the world safer, more equitable and more just if we follow the wisdom of global elites and govern according to international agreements on everything from climate policy and tax policy to labor policy and the treatment of women.

The problem with this is that it can sacrifice our national interests — and our sovereignty — abiding by international compacts that our enemies ignore, and our friends find preposterous. For example, the Chinese have zero intent of following the U.S. into the abyss of ""net zero"" green energy policy. To keep their economy growing, they are building coal plants right and left.

Yet, Biden persists in thinking that he and other leaders of developed nations can establish global ""norms"" by pledging to follow the dictates of Davos. This is like the little kid sitting in a grocery cart who thinks he is steering down the aisle.

By following these impulses to 1) do nothing and 2) tell everyone else what to do, Biden believes he is reducing risk and making a better world. In reality, what he has is a schizophrenic foreign policy that has increased global risk and left our friends and allies dazed and confused.

The most recent victim of this approach was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Her trip to Taiwan was important. And the stakes were high. China is America’s No. 1 threat, and Taiwan is the most serious issue that divides us. One would think every step the president would take would be serious, deliberate and proactive, because that is how serious people deal with serious risks. Not Joe.

His first instinct was to try to make the problem go away. So, he asked Pelosi to cancel the visit. This would have been a big slap in the face to Taiwan and a huge loss of face for the U.S.

When Pelosi refused, Biden then called Chinese President Xi Jinping and, after meekly reassuring him that the U.S. still clings to the ""One China Policy."" asked him to back down from his regime’s saber-rattling rhetoric opposing the trip. Again, no effect.

Indeed, throughout the crisis, Biden came across — to China, to Taiwan, to Pelosi and the rest of the world — as little more than a do-nothing Bystander-in-Chief. (Though, in fairness, he did tweet afterward.)

Once Pelosi left, China ramped-up its ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy ringing Taiwan with live fire drills. The administration response was mostly finger-waving at the Chinese, tut-tutting that they were not following the international norms as approved by our globalist overlords in Davos. Beijing must still be laughing.

But this is no laughing matter. Just ask Ukraine. When Putin threatened to invade, Biden tried the mix of do nothing, threatening with a handful of sanctions, and finger-waving about international norms. Rather than being deterred, Russia started a war that has harmed our economy and lowered our national security.

When will U.S. foreign policy get better instead of worse? The answer is: When the administration starts dealing with risks, rather than ignoring them."

Unknown to most Americans, the Chinese Communist Party has been buying our farms, land and even our homes for decades. Why? So they can take our food, technology and other resources for themselves.

What’s worse – it’s perfectly legal. That’s why I’ve introduced a bill to ban the Chinese Communists – and those acting on their behalf – from buying even another handful of American soil.

In recent years, China has exponentially increased its U.S. land holdings, especially of farmland. Between 2010 and 2020, China increased its agricultural land holding by nearly 2,500%, to encompass over 350,000 acres of American soil. Communists have not only purchased the fields and pastures of rural America, they have also taken control of food processing companies like the Virginia-based pork giant, Smithfield.

Chinese communists are gobbling up American agriculture in part because China can’t feed itself. While China is home to nearly 20% of the world’s population, it has less than 10% of the world’s farmable land. As a result, Beijing is forced to go elsewhere for sources of food, especially meat and other forms of protein.

TUCKER CARLSON: WHILE CHINA BUYS UP AMERICAN FARMLAND, WE MAY RUN OUT OF FOOD

And the CCP’s purchases in the U.S. have largely paid off. At the height of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, Smithfield made sure China got the pork it needed – while American groceries stores ran short. By taking our land and food-processing companies for themselves, Chinese communists benefit their own people and gain leverage over the United States in one fell swoop.

But that isn’t the only reason China is putting down roots in the United States. In some cases, they use our land as strategic outposts to steal advanced American seed and farming technology. In other cases, they’ve bought large tracts of land near U.S. military bases.

In North Dakota, a Chinese firm purchased 300 acres a few miles from a U.S. Air Force base, which reportedly is home to America’s most sophisticated military drone technology. The base also has been called ""the backbone of all U.S. military communications across the globe."" Similarly, in Texas, a former Chinese military official purchased over 130,000 acres on the U.S.-Mexico border conspicuously close to Laughlin Air Force Base.

As young Americans move off family farms and their aging parents increasingly retire from the business, China could buy even more. Millions of acres are expected to change hands in the next decade. We must ensure they don’t fall into the clutches of the Chinese Communist Party.

But the communists aren’t just capturing American agricultural land – they’ve also bought an astonishing amount of American real estate. Between 2010 and 2020, the American Realtors Association estimates that Chinese nationals bought over $200 billion worth of American real-estate, more than any other country in the world.

China’s 300,000-plus residential purchases in the United States since 2010 pose an unknown national-security danger, in addition to fueling the rising cost of living in places like California, where a disproportionate number of Chinese nationals buy. For America, allowing China to purchase our land is a lose-lose proposition.

Talk about a find.

A treasure trove of jewels, medallions and historic artifacts has been uncovered in the Bahamas that date back to the legendary 17th century Maravillas shipwreck — and the public can now get a look at it.

Nuestra Señora de las Maravillas (Our Lady of Wonders), a two-deck Spanish galleon, sank on Jan. 4, 1656, off the Little Bahama Bank in the northern Bahamas on a trip to Seville from Cuba.

It had been carrying numerous treasures of both royal tax and private property.

ALL-WOMEN ROWING TEAM BREAKS WORLD RECORD IN RACE ACROSS PACIFIC OCEAN

The 891-ton ship went down after colliding with its fleet flagship.

It struck a reef 30 minutes later — and ultimately sank.

The remains of the vessel were scattered for several miles across the ocean, with no significant portion of the ship left behind.

For more than 360 years, archeologists and adventurers have attempted to locate the debris that was lost in the wreckage.

And while much of the treasure — an estimated 3.5 million pieces, out of eight — was salvaged between 1656 and the early 1990s, modern-day technology tools such as high-resolution magnetometers, enhanced GPS and metal detecting have allowed Allen Exploration to bring to the surface riches beyond the imagination.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, Allen Exploration founder Carl Allen said that he and his team began pulling up precious artifacts in July 2020 near Walker’s Cay.

MILITARY VETERANS PRESERVE CORAL REEFS IN UNIQUE FLORIDA DIVE MISSION

High-tech tools, plus the official permission they received from the Bahamanian government to search the Northern Bahamas area — known to be a wreckage hotspot — have made for ""quite amazing"" discoveries, the entrepreneur said.

""We’ve recovered thousands of artifacts,"" he said.

""Cannons, anchors, emeralds and amethysts … We’re up to about 3,000 silver coins and 25 gold coins,"" he said.

The water in the area only reaches up to 50 feet deep, while the sand can bury treasures down to 20 feet, he revealed.

Yet that didn’t stop Allen from proving his doubters wrong and discovering treasures that took his breath away.

""When I pulled up the first valuable item, I lost my breath,"" he said. ""I couldn't breathe.""

""I've been thinking about this my whole life.""

The fascinating finds also include Spanish olive jars, Chinese porcelain and iron rigging, according to an AllenX press release.

The team also discovered a silver sword handle belonging to the soldier Don Martin de Aranda y Gusmán; the item helped the teams identify these treasures as belonging to the sunken Maravillas.

One golden pendant with the Cross of Santiago was designed in the shape of a scallop shell.

Four pendants worn by members of the sacred Order of Santiago, a religious band of knights active in Spanish maritime trade, were also recovered.

AllenX considered the Order of Santiago jewels to be the ""star"" finds thus far.

One golden pendant with the Cross of Santiago was designed in the shape of a scallop shell.

It's reinforced by what appears to be an Indian bezoar stone — a famous European stone known for its healing properties.

Another golden pendant garners the same cross overlaying a large, ovular Columbian emerald.

Three gold chains were retrieved, including an 887-gram gold filigree chain made up of 80 circular links and decorated with four-lobed rosette motifs, most likely crafted in the Philippines, the group said.

One golden pendant with the Cross of Santiago was designed in the shape of a scallop shell.

AllenX indicated that no exact replicas of the chain exist from other excavations in museum collections or as seen in Spanish portrait art.

Allen Exploration archeologist Jim Sinclair told Fox News Digital that these artifacts reveal how people lived in the colonial period and in the New World.

As an archeologist of 40 years, and as an original explorer of iconic wrecks such as the Titanic, Sinclair said a recovery such as the one from the Maravillas reflects an ""amazing leap"" in technology.

The archeologist also considered the artifact analysis to be a ""really good development"" in terms of detecting human behavior and history.

Although the worth of these artifacts most likely add up to the millions of dollars, the items are priceless, said Bill Springer, Allen Exploration spokesperson.

None of the Allen Exploration findings will be put up for auction or for sale.

Instead, the finds will become part of an exhibit at Allen Exploration’s Bahamas Maritime Museum, located at the Port Lucaya Marketplace in Freeport.

MIAMI-BOUND BOAT CAPSIZES OFF COAST OF THE BAHAMAS

The museum is set to open on Saturday, Aug. 6, 2022.

It will reveal other exhibits about maritime history in the Bahamas, as well as the transatlantic slave trade and the Lucayan people.

Only 45 survivors

The Maravillas exhibit also showcases the story of the ship’s demise.

Of the nearly 650 passengers who were on board the ship, only 45 are known to have survived.

No human remains have been located.

The shipwreck was a ""tremendous blow,"" Allen explained, since Spain at the time was struggling financially and the boat was jam-packed with valuables.

It was one of the largest treasure ships to have ever left the Indies — which is why Allen said he expects more artifacts to be uncovered still.

The ""mother lode"" has yet to be discovered.

The ""mother lode"" has yet to be discovered, he indicated; and when it is, he said the haul would be ""extremely valuable.""

""The manifest usually on these old ships, a lot of times — it was only about half of what was on the ship because there was so much contraband,"" he said.

""So, that's what's exciting.""

Along with launching the museum, Allen is furthering his passion for discovery and education by developing underwater archeology programs for Bahamian kids.

""The big problem is, [the debris] is not going to stay there forever,"" he said.

""And it’s a playground of shipwreck.""

Jennette McCurdy is opening up about her childhood trauma.

She says her overbearing mother and the television industry were both to blame, as they ""failed to protect her,"" according to the New York Times.

At the age of 16, McCurdy was entering her third year on the hit teen sitcom ""iCarly,"" where she made millions of young viewers laugh by playing the comedic character Sam Puckett.

The former actress gets candid in her new memoir, ""I’m Glad My Mom Died,"" in which she details her toxic relationship with her mother and her tumultuous time on Nickelodeon.

According to the New York Times, McCurdy, 30, wrote in her memoir about embarrassing moments on the children’s television network when she was asked to be ""photographed in a bikini during a wardrobe fitting and being encouraged to drink alcohol by an intimidating figure she simply calls the Creator.""

McCurdy pointed out that when her mother was present, she never interjected or instructed her daughter that this ""was the price of showbiz success.""

""Everyone wants what you have,"" she allegedly told her daughter.

In McCurdy’s memoir, which will be published on Aug. 9, she recounted auditioning for acting roles at the age of 6 and being ""shepherded"" into the work by her controlling mother. She also noted that she suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders and anxiety. McCurdy believed she owed her loyalty to her mother, who controlled every aspect of her life.

After McCurdy starred on ""iCarly,"" Nickelodeon promised her a spinoff series of her own, but walked back on their offer and made Ariana Grande a co-lead on ""Sam & Cat.""

McCurdy says she felt undermined by the network as they discouraged her from exploring other career opportunities outside the show. However, those rules did not seem to apply to Grande.

""What finally undid me was when Ariana came whistle-toning in with excitement because she had spent the previous evening playing charades at Tom Hanks’s house. That was the moment I broke,"" McCurdy wrote.

""Sam & Cat"" aired for only one season during 2013-2014, and after the show's cancellation, Nickelodeon offered the former actress $300,000 to keep her experiences at the network private, McCurdy said. She refused the offer.

Despite ""iCarly"" star Miranda Cosgrove saying that she and McCurdy quickly became friends on the show, she was not completely aware of the challenges her friend faced in her life.

It is not a converted VW this time around, however. It uses a custom aluminum monocoque chassis with rear independent suspension, rear-wheel drive and seating for two.

Is it Bigfoot — or a big fluke?

An Ohio woman claims that Sasquatch has returned to the woods near her home, based on an audio recording that she herself made of what she heard.

Suzanne Ferencak shared with Mansfield News Journal last week that this is the first time she’s ever recorded howling in her nearly decade-long tenure as a Bigfoot hunter.

An analyst described the two-minute recording as having ""high potential"" of carrying the sounds of one Bigfoot attempting to contact another, the News Journal reported.

""The first howler has a brassy tone to its voice that can be indicative"" of Sasquatch, the analyst said.

""There are a couple [of] features in the execution, such as shifting to an 'AA' phoneme at the end of the call that are indicative as well, most noticeable in the last two howls.""

Other wildlife experts aren’t so sure the sounds came from a Bigfoot creature, however, according to a USA Today report.

Workers at nearby Mohican State Park suggested that the sounds could’ve come from an alpha male coyote calling its pack.

The Bigfoot enthusiast first spotted the beast in May 2013 when it allegedly hopped over a back road southeast of her hometown of Loudonville, Ohio.

Ferencak told the News Journal that her rural home is prime habitat for Bigfoot and, for several years, experienced knocks and howls around the area — as well as other sightings, she said.

Even so, Ferencak purchased an audio recorder for her backyard to be sure she would not miss anything.

""If I'm out, I always have a recorder going,"" she told the local news outlet.

""I've been doing this for nine years.""

Ferencak finally caught the most recent loud howls on July 3 of this year. She suspects that the sounds came from a young or female Bigfoot calling to her babies.

It's an out-of-this-world project car.

A 1971 Chevrolet Corvette originally driven by Apollo 15 astronaut Al Worden, which was all but forgotten and left to the elements on a used car lot for years, will soon be ready to hit the road again.

The coupe was one of three that were leased to the mission's crew for a year for just $1 each by Melbourne, Florida, Chevrolet dealer and 1960 Indy 500 winner Jim Rathmann.

Rathmann had been leasing Corvettes to astronauts since the Mercury program, fully aware of the promotional value of having American heroes cruising around in his cars, but the Apollo 15 crew was the last.

GENERAL MOTORS BUILDING LUNAR TERRAIN VEHICLE FOR RETURN TO THE MOON

Command module pilot Worden and his crewmates, James Irwin and David Scott, ordered theirs in red, white and blue with coordinating stripes. Worden chose a white one with a 454 cubic-inch V8 under the hood and a Muncie 4-speed manual transmission.

He returned it at the end of the lease, and it was sold into private ownership, changing hands several times and ending up in Texas.

That’s where noted Corvette collector Danny Reed discovered it and added it to his collection in 2017, officially documenting its history in the process.

Reed also owns Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean’s 1969 Corvette, which he purchased directly from GM in 1971, along with Dave Scott’s blue 1971 model. Worden’s car was functional when Reed found it but very weathered from sitting outside for who knows how many years.

Max Kaiserman, the owner of space program merchandise marketplace Luna Replicas and friend of Worden’s, told Fox News Autos that Worden’s grandson, Will Penczak, found out about the car and visited it at Reed’s in 2020. Worden passed away the same year, and Penczak and Reed got to talking about what should happen to the car.

""We want to continue Al Worden’s legacy of inspiring young people to get into science and math and the arts""

Kaiserman and Penczak decided to team up and purchase it; not to fix and flip it at an auction but to become its custodians and share it with the world. They’ve now started Project AstroVette Endeavor and plan to restore it to some extent and use it as an educational tool by displaying it at science museums and other events.

OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD DRIVER EUGENE CERNAN RECOUNTS HIS RIDE ON THE MOON

""We want to continue Al Worden’s legacy of inspiring young people to get into science and math and the arts, all of which the space program and the Corvette represent,"" Kaiserman said.

The 80,000-mile car currently runs and is mostly-rust free, but it’s had some minor repairs and a few parts replaced over the years, so they’re still deciding what to do with it. Whether to preserve it as-is or bring it back to as close to original condition as possible.

A refresh to the standards of the National Corvette Restorers Society could run over $100,000, according to Kaiserman, while an extensive rotisserie show car-quality restoration might cost a quarter-million or more.

They’re open to any support for the project and are also asking anyone with photos of the car from the 1970s to share them to help get a better sense of its original condition, right down to what tires were on it when Worden had it. As of now, they only have one photo from Life magazine featuring the three astronauts and their cars parked behind the mission's Lunar Roving Vehicle, which was the first to go to the moon.

""How incredible is that the first astronauts to drive on the moon were also the last to drive Rathmann Corvettes,"" Kaiserman said.

""Al always exuded that classic ’right stuff’ attitude that you associate with the Apollo-era astronauts""

Gov. Gavin Newsom has mishandled California's severe, years-long drought during his time in office, while the state's farms face diminishing yields, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News.

""I think Gavin Newsom has failed when it comes to water,"" McCarthy, who represents a district in California's Central Valley, said.

For the second time in nine years, California is facing a generational drought – a period of dryness so severe, they're typically thought to only occur once per generation, according to Erik Ekdahl, the California State Water Resources Control Board's deputy director for water rights. The Golden State has also endured a megadrought – a drought that lasts longer than 20 years – since 2000, Ekdahl said.

""I think the state has actually done some remarkably good planning and preparation and implementation for drought,"" Ekdahl told Fox News.

DROUGHT-PARCHED WEST LOOKS TO MIGHTY MISSISSIPPI FOR SOLUTIONS TO WATER CRISIS

Regardless, farmers' yields and, consequently, their businesses, are suffering, said Sam Parnagian, a third generation California Central Valley farmer. Over one-third of the country's vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts are grown in California, according to the state Department of Food and Agriculture.

""You'll go see tens of thousands of acres that used to have nuts, almonds, pistachios, and they're just bare,"" Parnagian told Fox News. ""It's just all dust.""

California saw a brief reprieve from drought in 2019, just months after Newsom took office, according to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Drought Center. But by 2021, the state was once again plunged into severe dryness on a wide scale – and it could get worse.

""There's a very real prospect for a fourth year and potentially a fifth year of drought,"" Ekdahl told Fox News.

Newsom, a Democrat, needed to use the drought-free period to prepare, McCarthy said.

""You should store it in the abundant years to have it for the years coming forward when it comes to drought,"" McCarthy, a Republican, told Fox News. ""That would show you good management.""

McCarthy's district includes part of Kern County, 70% of which is characterized as facing ""exceptional"" drought conditions, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Exceptional drought, the most intense and devastating type of drought, can lead to widespread wildlife death, the removal of orchards, increased chances of wildfire and low crop yields, according to NOAA.

LAS VEGAS 'WATER COPS' PATROL FOR WATER WASTERS AMID UNPRECEDENTED DROUGHT

Newsom outlined a 142-step plan in 2020 to make California more resilient to drought. It included long-term projects such as new water storage construction, surveying for new water sources and the deconstruction of dams.

Many of those haven't been built, according to a progress report published in January. Ekdahl said many of the water projects could take years to be completed.

""They haven't built any new water storage, no new dams,"" McCarthy told Fox News. They continue to let water go out into the ocean.""

Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment.

""The Governor has worked with the legislature to invest $8 billion to implement the strategies in the Water Resilience Portfolio , which focuses on diversifying our water supplies, enhancing ecosystems, improving infrastructure and ensuring California is better able to manage hotter and drier weather"" Erin Mellon, a Newsom spokesperson, told the Los Angeles Times in July.

CALIFORNIA REDUCES SUPPLIES TO WATER AGENCIES AMID DROUGHT

But others agreed with McCarthy.

""These days, the Newsom administration and Legislature have done little more than engage in water shaming,"" Steven Greenhut, the R Street Institute's western region director, wrote in the Orange County Register. ""Where are the plans to bolster our water-storage capacities?""

Newsom in 2021 asked Californians to voluntarily cut water use by 15%, but in March 2022, usage increased by 19%. The governor threatened to make restrictions mandatory in response.

""There’s no need to shame Westerners for their water usage, but there is reason to shame our officials for not doing their part to upgrade and build new water infrastructure,"" Greenhut wrote, noting that Newsom should use California's nearly $100 billion surplus to invest in water facilities. He also blamed former Gov. Jerry Brown for inaction during another drought reprieve when he was in office.

Yet Newsom has also faced criticism for not imposing harsher restrictions.

""We know it’s an election year and Newsom doesn’t want to anger voters, but failing to impose mandatory water cuts in the midst of this crisis demonstrates a stunning lack of leadership,"" the Mercury News and East Bay Times editorial boards wrote.

HOUSE APPROVES BILL TO HELP WEST FIGHT WILDFIRES, DROUGHT

About 80% of water use in California is used for agriculture, according to the state Department of Water Resources.

""We're one of the most fertile lands in all the world, and we should be using it to maximize our industry here in California and food for the world,"" Parnagian told Fox News.

But the drought has even restricted farmers' water usage, consequently lowering their economic output, according to Ekdahl.

Some livestock farmers have even had to sell their cattle, a move that could cause beef prices to surge, FOX Business previously reported.

""You're seeing that people are starting to farm to the water that's available,"" Parnagian told Fox News. ""And in doing that, we're limited on the crops we can grow. We're limited on the yields that we can get.""

California rice producers are weighing importing from Japan and South Korea as domestic production has severely dropped, S&P Global Commodity Insights reported.

The former climate and conservation manager for the California State Water Resources Control Board, Max Gomberg, also felt Newsom wasn't properly handling water resiliency. But Gomberg, who said he left his post because the governor wasn't aggressive enough on climate change, felt agriculture has received preferential treatment.

""There are the zillions of acres of almonds and grapes. It’s not sustainable,"" Gomberg told the LA Times. ""Everyone knows it’s not sustainable, just like everyone knows the amount of withdrawals from the shrinking Colorado River system are not sustainable.""

Meanwhile, only five of California's 17 major reservoirs, which provide water for agricultural use, are over 50% capacity, and eight are below 35% capacity, according to the California Department of Water Resources.

""What we're seeing just over the last nine years or so, seven of the last nine years have been dry or critically dry,"" Ekdahl told Fox News. ""That's just put long-term stress on our reservoirs, how we use water and ecosystems and people that depend on it."""

Comedians, like Dave Chappelle, have been high-profile targets of cancel culture in recent years. Most recently, Minneapolis' First Avenue canceled Chappelle's sold out show hours before his set time after the storied venue faced backlash from its staff and community over the superstar comedian's jokes about the transgender community.

""When venues like First Avenue cave to the mob, that's what's dangerous,"" Denny continued. ""That basically tells all those transgender people that what they think Dave Chappelle saying about them is true, and that's not the case at all.""

The comedians told Fox News they believed the people aiming to censor comedians represented a small, but over-pronounced portion of America.

""We've just inflamed the very small minority of people who are sensitive and giving them superpowers,"" Fischer said. ""I don't think America has gotten too sensitive.""

Chrissie Mayr, a New York stand-up comic, told Fox News that censoring comedians is ""the most selfish thing you can do.""

""It's like 'Oh, I don't like this comedian … Not only do I not want to see them, but I want to make sure nobody else can see them,'"" she said.

JOHN CLEESE SAYS WOKENESS HAS A ‘DISASTROUS’ IMPACT ON COMEDY

Yet comedians have altered their jokes to align with shifting societal norms throughout history, Kliph Nesteroff, a comedy historian, has written.

""The tug of war between censorship and free speech has been part of comedy for its entire existence,"" Nesteroff wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed. ""It is likely to continue.""

He provided examples of 20th century comedians getting arrested or banned for their jokes.

Still, Fischer said modern cancel culture censored his own comedy for nearly a decade out of fear.

""I've been terrified to kind of step outside of that, you know, woke bubble,"" he said.

Over 80% of adults surveyed in a New York Times/Siena College poll in February said they felt it was a serious problem that some Americans wouldn't practice their freedom of speech out of fear of retaliation or harsh criticism. An April Morning Consult poll found that roughly one-third of adults felt they couldn't speak freely on social media.

Fischer also told Fox News he saw a shift once he began making of President Biden's age and low energy.

The Media Research center identified more than 600 instances of social media users facing bans, restrictions or deleted content over posts criticizing Biden between March 2020 and March 2022.

""Everyone has some line, some sacred cow, that they believe is not okay to make fun of,"" Denny continued. ""And that could be their politics, it could be their religious beliefs, could be any of those things.""

Denny, Fischer and Mayr argued that protecting some groups can actually lead to more exclusion in comedy.

Lupo, the outgoing Hard Rock president, called Faranca ""a great guy, smart, with great experience.
""Follow the direction of CEO Jim Allen, work compassionately and collaboratively with our wonderful Hard Rock team and the Atlantic City community, and even greater success will follow.""
With Hard Rock surging in the market, the question has been raised: Can it surpass the Borgata to become Atlantic City's top-performing casino?","At 11:30 on a Saturday night, Anthony Faranca was meeting with a group of cleaning workers at the Hard Rock casino before they started their shift, introducing himself, asking about their jobs and about themselves.

It was a telling indication of how involved and accessible the casino's next president plans to be.

Hired in June as Hard Rock's general manager, Faranca is being boosted to the top job now that current president Joe Lupo is heading to Las Vegas to run the Mirage casino once the company completes its purchase.

INFLATION CAUSE FOR 'CONCERN' AS TRAVEL-RELATED COSTS SOAR: HARD ROCK INTERNATIONAL CHAIRMAN

He's being handed the city's No. 2 casino in terms of money won from in-person gamblers (No. 3 when internet and sports betting money are included); a resort that has upped the city's game in terms of live entertainment.

But Faranca's gaze extends beyond the casino's walls to the city around it: He's been meeting with city officials on safety and cleanliness initiatives, pledges to continue Hard Rock's history of supporting charitable and community groups, and realizes the casino's success or failure rests squarely on the shoulders of its employees.

That's why late on a busy Saturday night, with a million other things to keep track of, he was huddling with the cleaning staff.

""I make it a point to go to pre-shift meetings with all the different departments, to thank them for what they do and connect with them,"" Faranca said.

A Philadelphia native, Faranca began his casino career in Atlantic City as a guest services manager at Harrah's and the Showboat. He worked in general manager roles at Philadelphia's Parx casino, the Palms in Las Vegas and at Maryland Live!, where he also was executive vice president, before joining Hard Rock.

Faranca says he has five core principles he plans to follow in his new job: Be the employer of choice in your market. Deliver exceptional hospitality. Clearly understand your property's strategy. Focus on the community. Have a commitment from ownership.

The casino is considering doing some hotel room and suite upgrades, and plans to diversify its entertainment lineup even more, he said.

Jim Allen, the global chairman of Hard Rock, has long pushed Atlantic City officials to make the city safer and cleaner, and has not hesitated to call them out when he feels conditions are poor. Faranca has already picked up that baton.

HARD ROCK INTERNATIONAL CHAIRMAN WARNS ECONOMIC CHALLENGES 'IN FRONT OF US ARE REAL'

""I hope everyone rallies behind the idea of a safe and clean Atlantic City,"" he said. ""When guests visit the city, they need a safe visit.""

He has already had discussions with City Councilman Kaleem Shabazz about the need for safety and cleanliness in the city, and will serve on the board of the Atlantic City Police Department Foundation.

""He is very sincere and open to working with government,"" Shabazz said. ""He seems to have a good sense of how a partnership should go and what issues in the community should be dealt with. I feel a strong sense of his community engagement.""

Lupo, the outgoing Hard Rock president, called Faranca ""a great guy, smart, with great experience. I could not be more pleased.""

His advice for his successor?

""Strong leadership is critical,"" Lupo said. ""Follow the direction of CEO Jim Allen, work compassionately and collaboratively with our wonderful Hard Rock team and the Atlantic City community, and even greater success will follow.""

With Hard Rock surging in the market, the question has been raised: Can it surpass the Borgata to become Atlantic City's top-performing casino?

Faranca smiles and refers to his five business principles.

""It's been an ongoing joke that whenever I would go to the South Beach Food and Wine Festival, someone would say to me, 'So when are you going to move to Florida?' I would always say, 'We're looking. We're looking for a house.' Because I love Florida. I love the people. I love the culture.""

CELEB CHEF GUY FIERI TAKES HIS CHICKEN JOINTS TO COUNTRY MUSIC’S CAPITAL

How much money does Guy Fieri make from television?

Last year, the chef reportedly signed an $80 million contract with the Food Network to host his two shows over the course of a three-year period. The new deal is a $30 million raise from Fieri's prior deal of $50 million, according to Forbes.

Fieri rakes in approximately $26 million per year, which is more than his competitor celebrity chefs such as Emeril Lagasse, who was paid $8 million, and Gordon Ramsay, who earned around $20 million last year. His signature show, ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dive"" first aired in 2006 and, after 33 seasons, earned more than $230 million in advertising revenue in 2020.

""I got a chance of a lifetime,"" Fieri told the Hollywood Reporter in the wake of the deal. ""I think I played it good.""

How did Guy Fieri rise to fame?

The $80 million deal represents a new level of success for Fieri who for most of his career was looked down upon by other celebrity chefs for his humble origins and simple tastes. Fieri started in the food industry at 10 years old and sold pretzels out of a stand. In France, he studied cooking and later moved to Las Vegas to attend the University of Nevada for hospitality management.

In 2006, Fieri was able to host his own show on the Food Network after winning in the second season of ""Next Food Network Star."" The show, ""Guy's Big Bite, only lasted for six episodes and Fieri earned approximately $1,000 per episode.

However, by 2010 the Ohio native was one of the most popular stars on the network when he premiered in Diners, Driven Ins, and Dives. The show follows Fieri on the road across the United States, Canada, and Mexico as he eats unique foods from popular local diners, drive-in restaurants, and dive bars.

By 2019, Fieri, along with the late Julia Child, became the fourth celebrity chef to be awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has been featured in more than 14 series on the Food Network.

How many restaurants does Guy Fieri own?

Fieri, via his company Knuckle Sandwich LLC, recently launched Flavortown Kitchens, a virtual brand with more than 175 locations worldwide, according to the chef's website. Moreover, Fieri owns more than 80 other restaurants under different brands, including Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar and Guy's Burger Joint on Carnival Cruise Lines."

Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

As a parent, you have two main options to help pay for your child’s college expenses: Parent PLUS Loans and private student loans .

The federal government offers Parent PLUS Loans and they come with unique benefits. Private loans come from private lenders, and they may have lower interest rates if you have good credit.

In this article, we’ll go over the main differences between the two types of loans to help you figure out which may be right for you.



Credible lets you compare private student loan rates from multiple lenders, all in one place.

Parent PLUS Loans vs. private parent loans

Both Parent PLUS Loans and private parent loans give you the opportunity to borrow money for your child’s higher education expenses. But they differ significantly in how interest rates are set and how you’ll repay them.

Parent PLUS Loans

The U.S. Department of Education offers Parent PLUS Loans, which are more formally known as Direct PLUS Loans. Graduate or professional students can take these loans out, as well as parents of undergraduate students.

You generally apply for these loans online through the StudentAid.gov website . In most cases, you won’t qualify if you have an adverse credit history, like a bankruptcy or foreclosure in the last five years or a history of late or missed payments.

Parent PLUS Loans have a fixed interest rate set by the federal government, which is currently 7.54%. That means the interest rate won’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You’re able to borrow up to the full cost of attendance, as determined by your child’s school, minus any other financial aid the student receives. When you take out the loan, you’ll also pay a fee of 4.228% of the loan amount. To pay the fee, the government will deduct a portion of the funds from each loan payout.

Private parent loans

Private parent student loans have no standard requirements. Instead, individual lenders set their own qualifications, interest rates, and repayment terms. But in general, lenders determine the interest rate based on your credit score. People with higher credit scores will qualify for lower rates, while people with poor credit will get higher rates, if they qualify.

You may find private parent loans with fixed or variable rates. Variable-rate loans typically begin with a lower APR, but this rate can rise over time. Fixed-rate loans don’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You usually have the option to make full principal and interest payments while your child is in school, or you can make interest-only payments to keep the interest from building up. Most private parent loans must be repaid within 15 years, though loan terms may be shorter depending on the lender.

The best private parent loans feature zero loan fees. Just like with Parent PLUS Loans, you’re solely responsible for repaying a private parent loan.

Cosigned student loans

A third option for helping your child pay for their college education is by cosigning their student loan. When you do this, your child is the primary borrower on the loan but you’re agreeing to be responsible for repaying the loan if your child defaults.

You may consider cosigning a private student loan with your child. In many cases, students aren’t able to qualify for a loan on their own since they may have little or no credit history. By cosigning, lenders take your credit into account as well. Any missed payments will hurt both your credit and your child’s. Many lenders offer a cosigner release option, which allows you to remove yourself from the loan once your child has made a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments.

A cosigner usually isn’t required on federal student loans.



If you need to take out private student loans, visit Credible to compare private student loan rates from various lenders in minutes.

When does it make sense to take out a Parent PLUS Loan?

A Parent PLUS Loan may make the most sense if you have fair credit. With these federal loans, the interest rate is the same no matter your credit score. If you don’t have any major credit problems, but your score simply isn’t the best, you may get a lower rate on a Parent PLUS Loan than you would on a private loan.

A Parent PLUS Loan may also be the best choice if you want to take advantage of one of the unique repayment plans the government offers:

Standard Repayment Plan — This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years.

This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years. Extended Repayment Plan — This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan.

This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan. Graduated Repayment Plan — This plan can help if you expect to have a higher income in the future. Your payments start low, but rise over time. Ideally, your income would grow along with your payment. You also have up to 10 years to repay your loan under this plan.

If your payments are still too high, you may have the option to combine all the Parent PLUS Loans you have into a federal Direct Consolidation Loan, which gives you the option of enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. With these plans, your monthly payment is capped at a certain percentage of your discretionary income. This can be a great option if your discretionary income is relatively low.

When does it make sense to take out a private parent student loan?

If your child has exhausted all their scholarship, grant, and federal loan options, and if you have excellent credit, a private parent student loan may make the most sense. You’ll likely be able to qualify for a lower rate than what you’d receive with a Parent PLUS Loan, saving you money in interest.

Private loans may also make sense if you’d like to choose a variable interest rate. This option gives you a lower initial rate, though it can rise over time. If you expect to pay off the loan quickly, though, you may be able to keep the lower interest rate and pay off the loan before it rises."

Fascination with outer space and space creatures existed long before movie magic and popular culture created ""E.T.,"" ""Star Wars"" or even the ""Alien"" franchise. The final frontier has been a source of endless conspiracy and controversy for decades.

Now, Fox Nation's ""Alien Abductions"" hosted by Abby Hornacek unpacks some of the most legendary alien encounters and introduces people around the country who claim to have been abducted by extraterrestrial beings.

One of the several stories featured in the six-part series that Hornacek traces is the mysterious invention of The Integratron by George Van Tassel, a legendary alien abductee and ufologist who lived in the Mojave Desert in California.



Van Tassel is largely considered to be one of the first contactees with aliens and, in many ways, is said to have kicked off a movement in 1950s America after allegedly encountering an alien from Venus named Solganda.

The new Fox Nation series unpacks Van Tassel's story of meeting Solganda, who supposedly gave extraterrestrial instructions to Van Tassel on how to build an immortality device.

This device became known as The Integratron, which he considered a time machine and a healing device.

While building the 38-feet-tall structure, Van Tassel grew a following he eventually turned into the Church of Universal Wisdom, increasing financial support for his out-of-this-world device.

Wildlife advocates sued federal officials Tuesday after the government missed a deadline to decide if protections for gray wolves should be restored across the northern U.S. Rocky Mountains, where Republican-led states have made it easier to kill the predators.

Congress passed it on June 13 and it was ratified by the requisite 28 of then-37 states on July 9, 1868.

BRITTNEY GRINER'S SENTENCE PUTS SPOTLIGHT BACK ON STRAINED US-RUSSIA RELATIONS

First, the deal would embolden Putin to continue using ""hostage diplomacy"" to achieve his anti-American agenda. The Biden administration may bring two Americans home, scoring much needed political points -- at a time the president’s popularity is at historic lows -- but it will endanger many more Americans in the future and harm U.S. security. For years, the Russian government has used prisoner exchanges to retrieve Russian intelligence operatives, cyber criminals, and other types of Russian citizens held in U.S. prisons. Typically, however, the Russians get away with extorting much more valuable Russian nationals, in exchange for ordinary Americans who break Russian law, sometimes unwittingly. The Russians have perfected this playbook.

In April, the Biden administration exchanged a former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed, who was serving a 9-year sentence in a Russian labor camp, after being convicted of assaulting two Russian police officers while drunk on a visit to Moscow. The Russians got back Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot who was arrested by US special forces in 2010 in Liberia and sentenced to 20 years of prison time in US jail in 2011 for conspiring to smuggle more than $100 million worth of cocaine into the United States.

In 2021, the Biden administration quietly deported back to Russia the world’s most dangerous cybercriminal, Alexei Burkov, who had been sentenced to nine years in prison in America. An elite hacker, Burkov operated a website, which sold stolen numbers of credit and debit cards and extorted millions of dollars in ransom from US businesses, in return for unlocking infected computer networks. No Americans appear to have been released by the Russians, and there’s a congressional investigation underway to determine if the Biden Administration got anything in return.

In 2010, the Obama administration released ten Russian spies who had been infiltrated into the United States by Russian intelligence Service, the SVR, ten years earlier. These deep cover agents posed as Americans, blending into regular American day-to-day life, with the goal of penetrating top echelons of U.S. government in order to influence U.S. politics. Some of the sleeper agents in this spy ring got close to infiltrating Hillary Clinton’s circle. The U.S. government did not rescue any Americans out of Russia in exchange for these Russian sleeper agents. Instead, it brought in just four Russian citizens – one nuclear scientist, two intelligence operatives, and one KGB agent – who had been jailed by the Russians for providing secrets to U.S. government.

Second, giving up Viktor Bout to the Russians would harm American security. Bout is not just a regular Russian criminal. He is a high-value asset for the Russians, having ties to Russian spy services and indirect links to Putin himself. Bout is the world’s most prolific international arms trafficker and is serving a 25-year federal sentence for conspiring to kill Americans. This former military intelligence officer was conspiring to sell millions of dollars-worth of weaponry and 10 million rounds of ammunition to a Colombian narco-terrorist organization before he was arrested in a sting operation by U.S. law enforcement officers.

Bout has already spent 15 years in prison and has been thoroughly interrogated by US officers. As a highly trained military intelligence officer, he is also a gifted linguist with command of five languages. Bout undoubtedly has critical insights to share with his former comrades in Russian intelligence about what he experienced in the hands of U.S. debriefers and what was of interest to them.

Bout is connected to a Putin ally, Igor Sechin, who is a former deputy prime minister of Russia and currently the CEO of Rosneft, Russia’s state-owned energy conglomerate. Despite being isolated in a prison cell for over a decade, Bout never gave up his connection the Sechin, a fellow intelligence operative with whom he had served in the Soviet military running operations abroad.

Finally, by giving up Viktor Bout, President Biden would waste millions of dollars from the U.S. intelligence budget and demoralize dozens and possibly hundreds of American law enforcement officers, intelligence analysts, and support personnel who made it possible to capture this criminal. U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) officers finally arrested him in a hotel in Thailand in 2008 after almost a decade-long operation. Similarly, it took ten years of scrupulous work by US counter-intelligence to nab Putin’s spy ring of sleeper agents in 2010. With a stroke of a pen President Biden, and Obama before him, undid all that hard and often dangerous work by U.S. officers.

The Russians are acutely aware of President Biden’s naïveté, weakness, and his self-interest at a time his domestic popularity is at historical lows. They have floated the idea of adding another Russian criminal to the Griner-Whelan-Bout swap – Vadim Krasikov, another Russian spy who was sentenced to life in prison in Germany for having assassinated a former Chechen fighter on German soil.

President Biden must prioritize American interests and security by keeping Viktor Bout in jail."

""Equal Justice Under Law"" is engraved on the ornate pediment above the entrance to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Department of Justice and the FBI continue to hurl eggs at it.

Monday’s pre-dawn raid by a battalion of FBI agents on former President Donald Trump’s Florida home represents an abandonment of the cherished principle embedded in our Constitution that the law will be equally applied to all of its citizens.

Instead, political status now dictates whether a person receives fair treatment in a supposedly fair justice system.

If you check the box marked ""Republican"" on a political affiliation form, brace yourself for persecution and prosecution. If you check ""Democrat,"" you’ll be granted special elevated status. You’re untouchable. Just ask Hillary Clinton and Hunter Biden.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA ‘UNDER SIEGE’ BY FBI AGENTS

The evidence is indisputable that Clinton, while serving as secretary of State, converted tens of thousands of government records to her private email server in the basement of her home. In simple terms, she was stealing. She committed at least 110 crimes under the Espionage Act, representing the number of documents that the FBI determined were classified and top secret. She jeopardized America’s national security by exposing vital secrets to our enemies. The State Department discovered her computer was successfully hacked.

But that’s not all. When Congress instructed Clinton to preserve all of her documents, she destroyed more than 30,000 of them while wiping her server clean by using file-deleting software. Her mobile devices were broken in half or demolished with hammers. Her willful destruction of government property constituted another set of crimes, including obstruction.

Did the FBI ever raid Clinton’s home in Chappaqua, New York, to seize the incriminating evidence she kept there? No. Just the opposite occurred. Without authority, then-FBI Director James Comey absolved Clinton despite overwhelming evidence of criminality that he spelled out in his infamous July 5, 2016, news conference.

Months later, when Comey was fired for usurping the power of the attorney general, he stole government documents from the FBI. He did it for the admitted purpose of leaking them to the media to trigger the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Trump over phony allegations of Russian ""collusion"" that Hillary invented and the FBI exploited. We know how that capacious witch hunt turned out.

Did the FBI ever raid Comey’s home to retrieve the documents he pilfered? Did the DOJ charge him with theft of government property? Of course not. Don’t be silly.

This brings us to Hunter Biden. His notorious laptop contains a trove of damning documents and emails that offer compelling evidence of multiple enrichment schemes with foreign entities that forked over millions of dollars for access to Joe Biden and the power he wielded as vice president. Instead of a multiple count indictment for influence peddling, money laundering, tax fraud and foreign lobbying crimes, a four-year investigation has produced nothing.

RAID ON TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO HOME BY BIDEN'S POLITICIZED FBI MEANS US NOW A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY

Did the FBI ever raid Hunter’s home to obtain additional evidence? Or Joe Biden’s home, since the laptop implicates him as involved in his son’s profiteering scams? You know the answer. Don’t be dense.

The FBI doesn’t abide by the law when Democrats are involved. The agency obstructs it. They’re running a protection racket for the Bidens.

Recently we learned that ""highly credible whistleblowers"" within the bureau exposed an internal ""scheme"" by senior officials to bury evidence of Hunter’s corruption by falsely portraying the laptop’s contents as ""disinformation"" from foreign intelligence sources. Those same officials then allegedly sealed the truth in a file that only they could access.

Don’t forget – the FBI had the computer in its possession since December 2019 and knew it was real. The contents were fully analyzed and overflowing with evidence of influence peddling. But the agency and the Justice Department kept it under wraps, taking no action to charge or prosecute.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Ten months later when news of the laptop broke, 51 former intelligence agents publicly bashed it as Russian disinformation. The FBI knew it was a lie that the bureau helped invent. So, officials remained mute to help Biden get elected.

FBI Director Christopher Wray has done nothing to clean up his cesspool of an agency. He seems more interested in covering up acts of malfeasance and misfeasance. But the FBI is not alone in abusing its powers to protect partisan allies and punish political adversaries. The whistleblowers have also identified a top official within Merrick Garland’s Justice Department who has done the same.

The attorney general, who was appointed by Biden, is overseeing the investigation of his boss’ son. To the extent that the president was a participant and beneficiary in Hunter’s schemes, Garland has a disqualifying double conflict of interest. Yet, he has refused to appoint a neutral special counsel even though it is mandatory under federal regulations.

Garland despises Republicans for denying him a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. Covering up for a Democratic president is his vengeance. He’s the attorney general in name only. Like Robert Duvall’s character in ""The Godfather,"" Garland serves as Biden’s ""consigliere."" He’s Joe’s protector, by hook or by crook.

As long as Garland and Wray preside over our nation’s law enforcement, ""Equal Justice Under Law"" is a farce."

Bob Barnes, the man who is cycling to all 50 U.S. state capitals, reached capital number 42 of St. Paul as he nears the close of his cross-country journey — which began almost one year ago.

Barnes, 52, of Syracuse, N.Y., told Fox News Digital that while he faced some negative interactions with locals, the trip took a pleasant turn in the outskirts of the Minnesota city.

""There are some areas of Minnesota where people are uptight,"" said Barnes, who reached St. Paul on May 20.

""There are some areas, St. Paul in particular, [where] they’re a little judgmental,"" he said.

""The only thing consistent about Minnesota is the terrain,"" he added. ""It’s been really easy to travel out here.""

""I was disappointed in Saint Paul,"" Barnes later added.

At a laundromat where he was washing and drying his clothes and shoes, a woman approached him and ""demanded that I put my shoes on,"" Barnes said.

""It was just a simple interaction — but those are the things that I base all my observations on,"" Barnes said.

‘Easy miles’

Barnes said that after he left St. Paul, everything changed for him about 30 miles outside the city.

""Here I am with my head down. I’m feeling dejected,"" he said, describing his mood at that time.

""And now, people are starting to come up to me, all talkative and inquisitive with a whole different vibe. It was really weird.""

""The people up there were actually more … inquisitive than anywhere else,"" Barnes added.

""There were so many cyclists and everybody just, one after the other, pulled up from behind me and just, ‘Oh, where are you going, what are you doing?’ And we’d stop and talk and that turned me around back to being in a good mood.""

Along the way, one of his Facebook followers met up with Barnes; they rode together for a bit, which made time go by faster, he said.

""When you’re with somebody, they’re easy miles,"" Barnes said. ""It’s easy to pedal. You don’t realize you’re pedaling. You’re just having a conversation and moving along nice.""

Major milestone for this cyclist

While in Minnesota, Barnes reached another milestone: crossing the Mississippi River one last time.

Barnes ended up crossing the Mississippi River a total of nine times on his trip, which began back on Aug. 1, 2021 — a year ago.

""It’s actually pretty cool,"" Barnes said. ""To cross the Mississippi River nine times on nine different bridges on one trip is fun.""

Staying in a casino

During one of his last nights in Minnesota, a follower of Barnes gifted him a room stay at a casino resort.

The follower works as a security guard at the casino and offered Barnes a $25 voucher for dinner along with his room.

""The casino — that was terrific,"" Barnes said. ""That’s kind of like what I needed.""

""The only thing I gambled was — they give you a card with $5 on it that I turned into $11 and then spent it.""

He added, ""But I don’t gamble. I feel too guilty if I gamble.""

What Barnes said he enjoyed the most at the casino was getting to mingle with other people.

When Barnes spoke with Fox News Digital about Minnesota in May, he had about 3,100 miles left on his trip. ""It’s counting down. It’s really good,"" Barnes said. ""It’s a really good feeling right now.""

After he left Minnesota on May 24, Barnes headed to capital 43 on his trip: Pierre, South Dakota.

A Virginia-based disaster relief and humanitarian aid organization traveled to eastern Kentucky over the weekend to cook and deliver hot meals to those in need following last week's deadly flash flooding.

Mercy Chefs — founded by longtime chef Gary LeBlanc — has been serving millions of chef-prepared meals during national emergencies and natural disasters since the aftermath of Katrina in 2006.

Their efforts began just days after Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear issued a state of emergency due to the severe flooding that killed dozens and displaced many others.

After the team arrived in Whitesburg on Saturday, they heard stories of families who were thankful to be alive after nearly being swept away in the devastating floods.

Beshear said on Monday that the death toll climbed to 30 following the storms, flooding and mudslides that began early last week. He also noted that the death toll would likely increase as search and rescue operations continued.

Some people stranded on rooftops are still waiting to be rescued, and more than 23,000 households are currently without power, Beshear said in an update about the catastrophic flooding.

""Over the last few days, Eastern Kentucky communities faced the most destructive flooding in the state’s history,"" Mercy Chefs Facebook post read. ""The death toll continues to rise as search and rescue teams continue their work, and now there is more rain in the forecast this week.""

Olivia Newton-John’s only daughter is mourning the loss of the beloved singer.



The Grammy-winning superstar passed away on Monday at her southern California ranch, her husband John Easterling confirmed on Instagram and Facebook. She was 73.



Chloe Lattanzi also took to social media, where she shared a series of sweet photos featuring herself and the late ""Grease"" star from over the years. One of the heartfelt snapshots was a smiling selfie of mother and daughter.



While the post wasn’t captioned, the 36-year-old shared a photo of the pair just three days ago. Newton-John is seen beaming as she stands proudly next to her daughter.

""I worship this woman,"" Lattanzi captioned that post. ""My mother. My best friend.""



In May 2017, Newton-John revealed that she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her back. In 2021, she described how Lattanzi was been by her side.



""I’m so lucky to still be doing all these things,"" Newton-John told People magazine about attending Lattanzi’s wedding and releasing a single with her called ""Window in the Wall.""



""I don’t think I imagined living this long!"" she said. ""I feel very blessed.""

The outlet revealed that while both women have always been close, their bond only grew stronger while they quarantined in California together during the coronavirus pandemic. While Lattanzi later moved to Portland, Oregon, she revealed in late July that she had moved back to be near her mother.



""I worked my whole life, and the longest period I can remember being home was my pregnancy with Chloe and the first year or two of her life,"" Newton-John reflected. ""So it’s been wonderful reconnecting with my baby. She is my reason to be.""



In 2016, Lattanzi opened up to the outlet about what it was like growing up with Newton-John.



""As a kid, I wasn’t paying attention to her as a celebrity,"" she explained. ""She’s my mom, you know? Like, she takes me to school. I think as I’ve gotten older, that’s when I got to listening to her music. I did a re-imagining of ‘Magic’ because I loved it so much.""

From 1973 to 1983, Newton-John was among the world’s most popular entertainers. She had 14 top 10 singles just in the U.S., won four Grammys, starred with John Travolta in ""Grease"" and with Gene Kelly in ""Xanadu."" The fast-stepping Travolta-Newton-John duet, ""You’re the One That I Want,"" was one of the era’s biggest songs and has sold more than 15 million copies.



""Physical,"" the bouncy, R-rated smash released in 1981, was No. 1 for 10 weeks and was named Billboard’s song of the year despite being banned by some radio stations. An aerobics-friendly promotional clip, filmed in the early years of MTV, won a Grammy for best video.



Newton-John’s recent albums included ""Stronger Than Before,"" holiday collaboration with Travolta ""This Christmas,"" and the autobiographical ""Gaia: One Woman’s Journey,"" inspired by her battle with cancer and by the loss of her father.



She is survived by her husband, daughter Lattanzi, sister Sarah Newton-John, brother Toby Newton-John and several nieces and nephews.

""It was a big flip from being the one who was being taken care of to being the one who is taking care of my mom,"" said Rosenthal.

She described the difficult journey a person faces when taking on the caregiver role of a family member.

""Different challenges started popping up,"" she said.

She noted that her mom ""would wander. We have two big dogs, so she would get lost with them in the neighborhood.""

She also said her mom would leave the stove on by accident.

""Caregivers already feel socially isolated — and when the pandemic hit, this just made it hard to connect with others.""

Rosenthal told Fox News Digital the most taxing situation for her was the behavioral challenges in her mother that she experienced.

""My mom’s agitation, her anxiety — she started to have hallucinations as well,"" said Rosenthal.

MASSACHUSETTS MOM IS HONORED BY HER GROWN KIDS IN PICTURE-PERFECT PORTRAITS

She said she searched the web for hours at a time to try to find ways of successfully communicating with her mom.

""You get lots of misinformation online,"" she told Fox Digital News.

Aside from experiencing the behavioral issues of their loved ones, Rosenthal said there is the social isolation aspect of the work they do.

""Caregivers already feel socially isolated — and when the pandemic hit, this just made it hard to connect with others,"" she said.

Rosenthal decided to use her technology skills and personal situation to create a career path to help those who are aging remain at home, while also supporting those who care for them.

Caregivers can type in the scenario or symptom they're dealing with — and a selection of skills training information is offered.

She eventually met with Jonathan Davis, the CEO of Trualta, which is headquartered in St. Joseph, Missouri — and became the director of growth for the company.

Rosenthal described the website as offering a menu of options.

Instead of selecting a movie genre from a menu of movies, for example, caregivers can type in a scenario or symptom they might be dealing with — and a selection of skills training information will be offered.

You might say, for example, ""that your loved one is wandering,"" she said.

Then, you might be provided with ""steps to reduce wandering, broken up by different tasks,"" said Rosenthal in describing the specific tips offered.

While caregivers may not need to understand the science behind their loved one’s disease, they do need to learn coping skills in dealing with the challenges the disease creates for the person they're taking care of, said Rosenthal.

""What’s important as a caregiver is how you can respond to create a better experience for your loved one and for yourself to reduce your burnout.""

Caregivers, she said, ""don't know what skills go into agitation — but they know the problem that they are having.""

Rosenthal said that ""what’s important as a caregiver is how you can respond to create a better experience for your loved one and for yourself to reduce your burnout.""

CAREGIVER FATIGUE IN AMERICA IS RISING AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE: REPORTS

Joel Salinas, assistant professor of neurology in the Department of Neurology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told Fox News Digital, ""A diagnosis of dementia is not just a diagnosis for the patient — it’s also a diagnosis for the patient’s family and whoever else will be providing informal caregiving.""

He said as well, ""Caregiving can add a significant stress on the ability to participate in work and self-care — and there is also a great deal of uncertainty about so many aspects of care and what to expect. There are serious health and economic impacts from this kind of caregiving, so seeking support early and consistently can be critical.""

A Trualta spokesperson said the e-platform provides adult learners with the ability to scan and find answers quickly from evidence-based sourcing.

A study published in 2021 in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports found that 84.4% of participants who accessed the Trualta platform reported using skills they learned via the online platform.

The study also found that skills pertaining to behavioral management were reportedly used the most (60%) — while over half the caregivers reported allocating more time for self-care.

There are reportedly more than four million caregivers in New York State who provide nearly 2.7 billion hours of unpaid care.

Caregiver burden scores also appeared to decrease after people used Trualta for 30 days, according to the study.

The study's authors said in the peer-reviewed published report, ""This highlights the potential for online interventions to help informal caregivers access valuable techniques they can apply in their daily life.""

Rosenthal, commenting on that study, told Fox News Digital that ""when the caregivers are offered access to Trualta, in just 30 days we see the following: a 12% decrease in behavioral symptom severity, a 10% decrease in distress and a 30% improvement in caregiver fulfillment.""

A previous study also showed that when a family member is trained in caring for a loved one at home, that training may lead to reduced hospitalizations for the loved one.

Rosenthal said that when a family member receives training in prevention and in recognizing different signs and symptoms of conditions, for example — such as urinary tract infections — earlier treatment can be given.

This can help prevent a more severe case, such as sepsis, which would require hospitalization.

There are reportedly more than four million caregivers in New York State who provide nearly 2.7 billion hours of unpaid care.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, most caregivers reported issues with burnout.

Sixty-one percent of those caregivers worry about caring for a loved one, the news release said, while 70 percent reported experiencing at least one mental health symptom during the pandemic.

Jonathan Davis, CEO of Trualta, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that many caregivers have no prior experience and don’t know where to turn for help.

Davis also said, ""Trualta’s goal is to empower family caregivers by providing them with valuable training and support resources that they can access from the comfort of home. Our e-learning platform is proven to help caregivers reduce stress, build confidence and feel less alone."""

Talk about pedaling with purpose!

The Pan-Massachusetts Challenge (PMC), a two-day charity bicycle ride across the Bay State, is on the cusp of contributing an incredible $1 billion to the fight against cancer ever since its inception in 1980.

The 2022 PMC hits the streets this weekend (Aug. 6-7) with thousands of amateur bicyclists pedaling across cities, down back country roads and past Cape Cod National Seashore to raise money for the Jimmy Fund at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

Organizers hope to raise and donate $66 million this weekend alone.

The PMC has donated $831 million to Dana-Farber since its founding 42 years ago. Organizers anticipate topping $1 billion in donations by 2024.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO FOUNDED THE STURGIS MOTORCYCLE RALLY, ‘PUT THE BROTHERHOOD IN MOTORCYCLES’

The PMC is a tribute to the power of the human spirit to take pain and turn it into progress.

Founder Billy Starr, a native of Newton, Mass., west of Boston, launched the event in 1980.

He pedaled across the commonwealth with 35 friends, after watching three relatives, including his mother, succumb to cancer in the 1970s.

Betty Starr was just 49 years old.

""The PMC was not a career plan,"" Starr told Fox News Digital. ""But it was something I needed to do. I saw an opportunity to do something good. It lit me up.""

Thousands of other cyclists are lit up as well by the event each year.

Many describe the charity ride as a spiritual experience: two days spinning past the New England countryside in the hot summer sun, at times pedaling in pain or on the verge of quitting, the whir of bicycle gears often the only sound with thousands of others united in common purpose.

""The PMC is the single largest contributor to Dana-Farber and the Jimmy Fund and is responsible for 55 percent of the Jimmy Fund’s annual revenue,"" the PMC proclaims on its website.

Every rider dollar raised goes to Dana-Farber. The event's entire operational budget is funded by corporate largesse.

IN CAPE COD COMMUNITY, TRUE-CRIME AUTHORS CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT A TRUE CRIME THERE

The ride’s signature 212-mile route is a two-day ride from the hills of Sturbridge in Central Mass. to the sand dunes of Provincetown at the far tip of Cape Cod.

The PMC is supported by thousands of volunteers who do everything from make sandwiches at water stops to load rider luggage on trucks destined for Provincetown.

Countless thousands of Massachusetts residents and visitors line the road to cheer riders along the flagship route and the PMC's many secondary routes.

Starr and his team of 36 pedal partners raised a mere $10,000 in 1980.



But the original riders felt they had done something special. Many of those cyclists have returned each year since.

""Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong that year,"" said Starr. ""Yet everyone thought that it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.""

The ride has only grown since, which Starr pushing harder and demanding more from fundraisers and corporate sponsors each year.

The average two-day rider today raises $9,700, nearly the total of the entire first ride, said the founder.

""There is some sort of magnet to the ride. I don’t know what it is,"" Barry Kraft, who has pedaled across the state in the PMC with Starr every year since its inception in 1980, told Fox News Digital.

""You’re helping people in need and there are people cheering you the entire way.""

""You’re doing something incredibly challenging. You’re helping people in need and there are people cheering you the entire way. People feel great about it afterward.""

Police are investigating Anne Heche for driving under the influence after she crashed her car into a home in Los Angeles on Friday.

The crash ignited a fire and almost destroyed the Mar Vista home.

Julia Jayne, founder of Jayne Law Group, P.C., explained to Fox News Digital that Heche would be charged in the crash, even if she wasn't under the influence.

""She's going to get charged,"" Jayne said. ""They're going to try to charge her with something for that. Reckless driving at a minimum, if she's got no alcohol in her system.""

ANNE HECHE IN A COMA FOLLOWING CAR CRASH: SHE HAS NOT 'REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS,' REP SAYS

Legal experts previously told Fox News Digital that Heche could be charged with reckless driving, hit-and-run and potentially DUI.

A public information officer for the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to Fox News Digital that authorities obtained a warrant for a sample of Heche's blood on Aug. 5.

The results of the blood test are pending and the investigation ongoing. If Heche is found to have been intoxicated during the crash, she will be charged with a DUI hit-and-run, LAPD told Fox News Digital. Authorities will then present the case to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office.

If drugs are detected in the LAPD's initial toxicology screen, authorities will have to run a confirmatory test to decide what level of drug was in Heche's system. This secondary toxicology report could take up to 30 days, according to a representative for the Los Angeles Police Department.

Jayne, a criminal defense attorney, told Fox News Digital that police taking time to investigate driving under the influence isn't ""unique"" to Heche's crash.

""If there's time, send it to the lab,"" she said. ""Get the blood test results, because also there are certain enhancements that they might want to charge depending on what the blood alcohol level is. So, it makes sense that they would do that investigation, not unique to her in any DUI case.""

Jayne explained that if the blood sample was taken within three hours of Heche's crash, the blood sample would be considered ""reliable for the time of driving.""

""They probably took it within that time, and that gives them some confidence,"" she said.

The ""Donnie Brasco"" actress is in ""extreme critical condition"" after the crash, a representative for the actress told Fox News Digital on Monday.

""She has a significant pulmonary injury requiring mechanical ventilation and burns that require surgical intervention,"" the rep said. ""She is in a coma and has not regained consciousness since shortly after the accident.""

Heche's rep shared on Saturday that she was in ""stable condition,"" noting that the actress' ""family and friends ask for your thoughts and prayers and to respect her privacy during this difficult time.""

Heche's ex-boyfriend, Thomas Jane, previously told the Daily Mail that the actress is ""expected to pull through.""

The actress crashed her Mini Cooper twice on Friday, with the second crash igniting a fire that left a home almost destroyed in the Mar Vista neighborhood.

Heche suffered burn injuries but was ""conscious and breathing"" when paramedics removed her from the vehicle.

It's unclear when the results of her toxicology report will be returned to authorities.

LeBron James aims to give students at his I Promise School opportunities they may not have otherwise.

Recently, the NBA superstar's mission shifted into another gear.

James Bromsey III, a sixth-grader at James' school in Akron, Ohio, was given behind-the-scenes access before NASCAR’s race Sunday at Michigan International Speedway.

It was a fitting way to celebrate a student, whose father died four years ago. James Bromsey II shared a dream with family and friends that his son would be in the Akron Soap Box Derby, an event that dates to 1934.

NASCAR REVEALS WHY DENNY HAMLIN'S POCONO-WINNING CAR WAS DISQUALIFIED

""My son was six months old when his dad said he was going to be in the soap box derby,"" Tomika Pope recalled.

Bromsey fulfilled a promise to participate in the event in June. He was awarded a VIP experience by Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing, which put a paint job on Chris Buescher's No. 17 Ford to include logos, colors and words associated with the LeBron James Family Foundation.

Bromsey rode in a pace car, climbed up the spotter's stand and had a meet-and-greet session with Buescher.

""When did you do your first flip? he asked Buescher, who said he had not flipped, but did recently have his car catch on fire. Buescher went on to tell his guests that his dad got him started in racing.

""Dad was into racing, too,"" Bromsey said quietly.

During a tour of RFK's hauler, which included a peek through an overhead opening at the space where the team stores its two cars, Bromsey's aunt Tracy Gholston was almost brought to tears. Gholston said her brother died in 2018, shortly after a bout with pneumonia.

""He could have led this tour,"" she said, choking up. ""It’s so emotional to see how God put this all together.""

Bromsey added: ""He would be telling you everything about all the cars.""

Bromsey also was given access to the garage area, where he posed for pictures and pointed toward the I Promise School logo on Buescher's car. He later walked behind the Mustang as it was pushed to the track and watched as Buescher finished 16th in the 37-car race won by Kevin Harvick in the No. 4 Ford.

James is a minority owner in Fenway Sports Group, a parent company of RFK Racing. He opened the I Promise School, which is at full capacity with third to eighth-graders, four years ago in a partnership with his family foundation and Akron City Schools, aiming to support kids facing the same problems he had during a challenging childhood.

Before the race, James wished Buescher luck on Twitter and celebrated Bromsey's experience.

""For James to have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity at the track is amazing,"" James said. ""He’s an incredible kid with a love for racing. We wanted to show him that anything is possible when you go out and chase your dreams. And with the No. 17 car representing all of us, we want all the kids from Akron to know that nothing is out of reach for them.""

Did a day at the track inspire Bromsey to someday become a NASCAR driver?

""I'll stick to the soap box derby,"" he said, with a grin."

New York Jets offensive lineman Mekhi Becton will ""more than likely"" miss the entire 2022 season after suffering a significant knee injury during training camp on Monday, head coach Robert Saleh revealed Tuesday.

Saleh said the 2020 first-round pick will be going for a second opinion on Wednesday to assess the injury to his right knee. According to ESPN, he suffered a fractured kneecap.

""Still doesn’t look good,"" Saleh told reporters. ""It’s probably the inevitable,"" he said, later clarifying that his season was ""more than likely"" over.

JETS OFFENSIVE TACKLE MEKHI BECTON GOES DOWN AFTER APPEARING TO REINJURE RIGHT KNEE

The 6-foot-7 lineman, who was rumored to have hit 400 pounds last season, was run-blocking at right tackle on the second play of team drills when he went down on the grass and immediately grabbed at his knee.

Becton was down for a few moments before trying to get up and needed assistance from trainers to walk off the field.

Saleh, anticipating the media and fan storm that would soon follow, defended Becton and his work ethic.

""You worry about all of them. These are young men and I think sometimes with social media in this world, we dehumanize these athletes – in the worst way imaginable. Mekhi has walked in this building and he has taken every single punch you can get from every which way and he shows up and he works his tail off and he grinds every single day,"" he said.

""He’s fighting for his family, for himself, for his teammates, for this organization, for this fan base and he’s doing everything, and then everyone wants to drop him like a wet rag. That ain’t the case. We love Mekhi. We appreciate everything he's done. His ride is not over. His story is not over.""

Becton responded on social media, thanking Saleh for his words.

""I appreciate you more than you know coach!! Love you coach!!! ITS NOT OVER!!!,"" he said in a tweet.

Becton entered his first two NFL seasons as the starter on the left side, but suffered a dislocated right kneecap and cartilage damage in the opening game last year at Carolina.

Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

Getting a personal loan can be difficult if you have a limited credit history or bad credit. Some lenders that target bad credit borrowers promise no credit check and fast funding. But these loans often come with expensive fees that can trap you in a cycle of debt.

If you’re struggling to choose the right personal loan — or finding it flat-out impossible — you may start to feel discouraged. Before you settle for an expensive loan product, though, here are some bad credit loans that you should avoid — whether you just need a few hundred dollars, want a $10,000 loan , or anything in between.



Credible makes it easy to see your prequalified personal loan rates from various lenders, all in one place.

1. Payday loans

A payday loan is a small, short-term loan intended to tide you over with an advance until your next payday. Storefront payday lenders typically offer these loans, but you may also find them online. Depending on your state, there may also be a maximum borrowing limit, often $500 or less. Lenders usually require borrowers to repay these loans in two to four weeks’ time, in one lump sum, plus fees.

If you’re struggling to make ends meet before your paycheck hits, this can seem like an enticing loan option, especially if you need same-day funds .

Why you should avoid them: Most payday loan lenders don’t have strict credit- or income-based qualifications, so they often loan money to people who may struggle to repay the debt . Additionally, these loans are notoriously expensive. While most states cap the interest that can be charged per $100 borrowed, this is usually in the range of $10 to $30.

While that may not sound like too much, when you consider the length of the loan term and the low borrowing limits, these fees work out to an astronomical APR. For example, a $100 payday loan with a two-week repayment term and a $15 fee equates to an APR of nearly 400%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

Compare that to the average interest rate on a 24-month personal loan — 8.73% in May 2022, according to the Federal Reserve — and it’s easy to see what a ""deal"" payday loans really work out to be.

2. Cash advance loans

A cash advance loan is similar to a payday loan, in that you can use its short-term funds to help you cover immediate or unexpected expenses. These loans can even be funded as quickly as the same day, depending on the lender.

Cash advance loans differ from payday loans in some important ways, though. For starters, you can usually borrow a lot more with a cash advance loan, with some lenders offering as much as $5,000. You don’t always have to repay a cash advance loan in just a few weeks, either; you may be able to take out a cash advance that you can repay in monthly installments.

Why you should avoid them: Cash advance loans are still significantly more expensive than traditional personal loans, or even credit cards. Depending on the lender, your cash advance loan could have an APR of 299% or more.

3. Car title loans

If you have bad credit and need to borrow money, using your vehicle as collateral to get a car title loan could be one option. But car title loans aren’t a good choice for most borrowers.

Title loans often have repayment terms as short as 30 days, though you might find installment options as long as 24 months. The amount you can borrow depends on your location, as well as the value of your vehicle — as long as you own your vehicle free and clear.

Why you should avoid them: The downside? You probably already guessed it: You’ll pay significantly more in interest with a title loan than with a traditional personal loan. It’s not uncommon for car title loans to have APRs in the triple digits.

More than that, though, you’re securing the loan with one of your most important assets: your car. If you were to default on your title loan, the lender could take ownership of your vehicle.

4. Pawn shop loans

A pawn shop loan is a short-term loan that’s secured by something you own, such as jewelry or other valuables. These loans typically allow you to access money quickly, depending on how much your valuables are worth.

Pawn shop lenders typically don’t run a credit check, so these loans can seem like a good option for borrowers with poor credit or those looking for a no-credit-check loan . The pawn shop will usually offer a percentage of the pawned item’s value in loan form. You’ll need to repay the loan by an agreed-upon date, or the shop keeps the item.

Why you should avoid them: If you repay the loan as agreed, you can get your valuables back. But your pawn shop loan will have accrued interest in the interim, which you’ll also need to pay. These loans also tend to have a variety of fees tacked on, such as storage, setup, and even appraisal fees. For this reason, a lower interest rate can be deceptive, as the loan will actually end up costing you considerably more in the end.

Try a personal loan instead

If you need funds for an unexpected expense, large purchase, or even to refinance high-interest debt, a traditional personal loan is often your best bet — even if you have bad credit. Here are some things you can do to increase your chances of qualifying for one:

Apply with a cosigner. Adding a cosigner with good credit to your personal loan application may be the answer to getting approved or snagging better interest rates. Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit.

Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit. Check your credit reports. If your low credit score is keeping you from getting a personal loan, it’s important to understand why. Check your credit reports to see what sort of negative items are bringing down your score. In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected.

In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected. Consider a secured personal loan. A secured loan uses one or more of your assets as collateral for the debt. Because of this added protection, lenders often have lower credit score requirements for secured loans and may even approve borrowers with a bad credit score. Some financial institutions might not even require a minimum credit score at all, as long as you’re securing the loan with an asset. But keep in mind that if you fall behind on your loan payments, the lender can take your collateral."

WHAT IS CASH-OUT REFINANCING AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

How mortgage rates have changed over time

Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac — 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates.

If you’re ready to take advantage of current mortgage refinance rates that are below average historical lows, you can use Credible to check rates from multiple lenders .

How to get your lowest mortgage refinance rate

If you’re interested in refinancing your mortgage, improving your credit score and paying down any other debt could secure you a lower rate . It’s also a good idea to compare rates from different lenders if you're hoping to refinance so you can find the best rate for your situation.

Borrowers can save $1,500 on average over the life of their loan by shopping for just one additional rate quote, and an average of $3,000 by comparing five rate quotes, according to research from Freddie Mac .

Be sure to shop around and compare current mortgage rates from multiple mortgage lenders if you decide to refinance your mortgage. You can do this easily with Credible's free online tool and see your prequalified rates in only three minutes.

The rates assume a borrower has a 740 credit score and is borrowing a conventional loan for a single-family home that will be their primary residence. The rates also assume no (or very low) discount points and a down payment of 20%.

When is it worth it to refinance?

Refinancing a mortgage can be a great way to save money. But it’s not always the best move for every homeowner.

People refinance for a number of reasons, including to get a lower interest rate, change their monthly payment amount and lower their interest costs. Generally, if you can lower your interest rate by at least 0.75%, refinancing might be a good move.

But before you refinance, be sure to weigh closing costs, and calculate how long it will take before your savings from the refinance cover the expenses of refinancing.

Generally, a good mortgage rate is one that’s the lowest you can qualify for based on your individual factors, such as credit history, income, other debts, down payment amount, and more.

A rate that’s good for your financial situation should result in a monthly mortgage payment that you can manage, while leaving plenty of room in your monthly budget to put toward savings, investments, and an emergency fund. And a good rate should be competitive with average rates in the geographic area where you’re looking to buy.

PRIVACY TIP: 5 WAYS YOU'RE BEING TRACKED YOU MUST STOP RIGHT NOW

Start with the outside

Keeping your phone clean isn’t hard with the right supplies and a little bit of elbow grease. Set down the paper towels and follow these simple steps for cleaning your screen, ports, and case.

Cleaning the screen

First, remove your phone’s case and accessories. You want to reach every nook and cranny.

A microfiber cloth works for wiping away smudges and grease, but I prefer screen cleaning wipes designed for smartphones. They’re just so easy. Skip paper towels. They’re too rough for delicate jobs like this.

I have purchased this 210-pack of screen cleaning wipes from Care Touch time and time again. Use them on smartphones, tablets, monitors, TVs, and remote controls. They’re scratch-free and made with anti-static tissue that cleans without leaving behind streaks or lint.

Don’t forget the ports

Your phone's ports collect dust, grime, and dirt. Avoid using cotton swabs, which leave behind fuzz and could leave you worse off than when you started. Toothpicks can work if you are very gentle, but breaking off the sharp end inside a port is easy.

I prefer tools made for the job. It helps that these are cheap.

This Skylety 17-piece phone cleaning kit is under $10. The kit includes anti-static brushes, nylon brushes, cleaning cloths and a de-dusting film. You can use them to clear the gunk out of your ports gently.

Scrub your case

If you keep your phone in a case, I bet you’re shocked every time you take it off and see all the grime collected inside it. You don’t need to be quite as careful with your case as your phone's screen and ports.

For plastic, rubber, and silicone cases, grab an old toothbrush and a bit of warm, soapy water. Use the toothbrush to reach all the corners and crevices. Rinse it thoroughly.

Very lightly dampen a microfiber cloth with water and a mild soap for leather cases. Lightly rub the case in circular motions.

After it’s clean, let your case dry thoroughly before you put it back on. Need case recommendations? I share some here, along with my favorite screen protector . This has saved me from cracking my iPhone several times.

Now that your phone is bright and shiny on the outside, let's dive into the inside.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there's been an increased focus on mental health, especially among young people. 1 out of every 6 children age 6 to 17 experience a mental health disorder every year, and now a new investment company wants to use technology to make them easier to treat. Telosity by Vinaj Ventures is a fund set up back in 2019 specifically to invest in companies that provide tech-based solutions to improve mental well-being among young people, a demographic used to doing pretty much everything on their phones or computers. The founder and CEO, Anish Srivastava, says he was inspired to start the fund when he saw how few mental health resources were available, especially for kids and teens. ""Accessibility is very difficult,"" according to Srivastava, ""and what tech does is it helps democratize access to care.""

And if Telosity is successful, in the near future, kids and teens might be meeting their mental health counselors in cyberspace, which the company wants to use as a jumping off point to meet young people in the space where they're most comfortable. ""We can use that as a place for resources,"", says Srivastava, ""whether its educational types of capabilities, self learning mental health, being able to provide tele-therapy solutions, et cetera.""

And it's not just scheduling apps and telemedicine; new advancements in virtual reality could make it much easier for doctors to examine - and also treat patients - in an online setting. Telosity has been seeing a growing market interest in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), and much of it focuses on mental health assessment tools for providers. All that could make it even easier for kids and teens to access mental health resources, since they don't even have to leave their homes in many cases.

It's also good news for businesses. Telosity released a report last month showing youth mental health solutions will be a $26,000,000,000 market by 2027, and the company calls that an unprecedented opportunity for businesses to beef up their bottom line, while also providing help to millions of the most vulnerable Americans. Srivasta says that could be a major selling point for investors in the mental health space. ""There's an opportunity to do good while investing and building sustainable businesses, and I think that's the driver for tech.""

PRIVACY TIP: 5 WAYS YOU'RE BEING TRACKED YOU MUST STOP RIGHT NOW

The key to retrieving text messages

Your best bet for retrieving deleted messages is accessing an older backup of your phone. You can do that through iCloud for your iPhone.

There's a big caveat you need to keep in mind: Restoring your phone to a previous backup means you lose new data after that backup.

Now, it's worth saying that these steps don't always work. If you strike out, you can try contacting your phone carrier. It may be able to restore deleted messages for you.

Have an iPhone? Turn on iCloud and iCloud Backup

On an iPhone, you have access to 5 GB of free storage. You will likely need to upgrade to an iCloud+ plan to store multiple backups and all your photos and videos. See pricing and tiers here .

To retrieve deleted texts on an iPhone, you must turn on iCloud Drive and iCloud Backup. Here’s how to enable Drive.

Turn on iCloud Drive by going to Settings.

Then, select your Apple ID.

After that, tap iCloud.

Lastly, turn on iCloud Drive.

After that, you need to turn on iCloud Backup. Do this by opening Settings > Selecting your Apple ID > tapping iCloud and selecting iCloud Backup.

NOTE: You will lose all new data after that backup. Make sure those deleted texts are worth it. Here’s how to access them.

Well, that’s handy: 9 best iPhone calculator tricks you didn't know your phone was capable of

How to get back deleted texts on iPhone

Remember, when you access an old backup, you reset your iPhone to old settings. This could lead to a few issues. If you’re willing to risk it, follow these steps to see if you have a backup available:

Go to Settings.

Select your Apple ID.

Tap iCloud > Manage Storage > Backups.

Next, follow these steps to use that backup to restore your phone:

Head to Settings > General > Reset.

Select Erase All Content and Settings.

Tap Restore from iCloud Backup.

Sign in with your Apple ID and tap Choose backup.

Your phone will revert to its former version. Now you can start looking through old texts.

This method won’t work if you’ve never backed up your iPhone on iCloud.

1. Lighting matters

""You're going to ruin your eyes!"" We all heard that as kids sitting in front of the TV, right? Watching TV probably won't cause lasting vision damage, but it might strain your eyes.

A mellow, dimly-lit room is the best way to watch TV. Open windows, glaring track lights, and other distracting illumination sources make your eyes work overtime.

You don’t need a bunch of fancy smart lighting or gadgets, either. Draw the blinds, turn off the house lights, and stick to incandescent over LEDs if you prefer not to go full-on black-out mode.

Lamps and other lights can cause annoying reflections and glare. Choose ambient light sources muffled by diffusive domes or lampshades.

Get your money’s worth: 5 things you didn’t know your smart TV could do

2. Smart formula to know if you’re too close

When it comes to eye health, you should sit far enough from the TV so your eyes won't be exposed to excessive glare.

The secret formula: Measure the width of your TV and multiply that number by five. This distance is the ballpark you should shoot for in your home theater, living room, or any other spot you have a TV. Now, it’s harder to stick to this formula with larger TVs.

The size of the room, the shape and number of seats you have to configure, and other factors like window placement also come into play. Some give or take is fine. Aim for at least about 10 feet away if you can.

3. Check your screen height

A TV installed too high or low can cause eye and neck strain. The most comfortable viewing experience is with the TV around eye level when you’re sitting. So, how do you set it up? Use a laser pointer or a long measuring tape to find your direct line of sight from the best seat in the house.

Have a friend or family member lightly mark the spot on the wall with a pencil. If you’re working alone, do your best to remember where the marker hit during the experiment. The center of your TV screen should sit about where you marked.

3 ways to find out if your smart TV was hacked (and how to protect it)

4. Turn down the brightness

Bright, concentrated blue light is harsh on your eyes. That’s why staring at your phone in a dark room can feel so jarring.

Is your TV backlit? An OLED? What HDR capabilities does it bring to the table? All this impacts what brightness is best. Your eyes will also give you lots of clues. Do you find yourself squinting when the room is dark? The TV is probably too bright.

Check your TV's user manual or click the settings menu to find the brightness. Don't just rely on one of the pre-sets. Tune up and down and see what's best for your space.

Take some time to play with color temperature, HDR settings, and image saturation, too.

Decades after they starved, beat and tortured the boy – caging him in a slatted wooden box the size of a coffin – an underage World War II veteran refused to speak about his former enemies with hatred. His story holds lessons about reconciliation for a nation battered by today’s culture wars.

Joseph Johnson was only 14 when he enlisted in the U.S. Army, a year before Pearl Harbor. He’d fled a difficult home life in Memphis, fibbed about his age to a recruiter, and managed to get lost in the shuffle. He was sent to Manila with the 31st Infantry Division, having no clue of the impending horror.

On Dec. 7, 1941, 10 hours after attacking Hawaii, Japan hit the Philippines. The largely under prepared U.S. and Filipino troops were plunged into battle. The boy fought bravely, loading machine guns and ferrying messages between headquarters and front lines. Once, to escape a sniper’s attack, he leaped into an empty foxhole, only to land on an enemy soldier crouching in the dirt. The boy fought for his life, subduing his opponent with his bare hands.

Joe had met an orphaned teenage girl back at a brothel in Manila, and they became unlikely friends who helped each other endure. When she’d become pregnant from her unfortunate job, Joe helped her seek sanctuary in a church. He paid the nuns for the girl’s room and board.

LAST REMAINING WORLD WAR II MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT TO LIE IN HONOR AT US CAPITOL

The memory of her friendship helped sustain the boy in the fight on Corregidor, where Joe and his fellow soldiers made their last stand. The allied troops were outgunned and outmanned, plagued with tropical diseases, and cut off from resupply. As their foodstuffs slowly diminished, they ate monkeys found in the jungle.

Finally, in May 1942, Gen. Jonathan Wainwright formally surrendered all allied troops in the Philippines. Joe laid down his arms and became a prisoner of war. He was 16.

At the brutal Nichols Field detail, Joe and fellow POWs were forced to extend an airstrip. It was backbreaking work with a pick and shovel in the broiling sun.

Joe suffered from a raft of tropical diseases, including pellagra, dry beriberi, scurvy and malaria. After being savagely beaten for a small rule infraction, Joe knew he wouldn’t survive Nichols Field. Feigning insanity, he sliced his arms with a sharpened spoon and smeared blood on his face, hoping the guards would send him to Bilibid Prison, where a few American doctors still practiced.

That’s when he spent a week locked in a cage. Naked, bloodied, prodded through the slats by his captors, the boy was given no food or drink. Rainwater kept him alive. Finally, he was tossed on the back of a truck and driven to Bilibid, where he slowly regained his health. His audacious plan had worked.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, AUGUST 2, 1943, JFK SAVES PT-109 CREW AFTER COLLISION WITH JAPANESE DESTROYER

But his horrors weren’t over. In October 1944, Joe and 1,600 POWs were loaded onto a ship to work in Japan’s mines. By the time they reached port six weeks later, only 450 POWs were still alive. Suffering malnutrition and a grisly leg injury, Joe was held at the Fukuoka POW camp until Japan’s surrender in August 1945. At last, he came home to freedom. Joe was 19 years old and had grown to 6 feet, 4 inches. He weighed only 109 pounds.

Post-war, Joe struggled with severe PTSD. Counseling, family and faith helped. He learned the wisdom of forgiveness, as recorded in his journal: ""Life is too short to hold on to hurt. Whether you’re hurt from being abused as a POW or from your daddy leaving when you were young, you got to set that hurt down. You’ll only hurt yourself when you harbor hate.""

In his senior years, Joe became active in veteran causes, using his scars to help people heal. He became a rebuilder of lives, a restorer of spirits. Whenever he spoke about the past, he never used the derogatory word for his former captors, always speaking about them with respect.

For America today, embroiled in culture wars and divided by hostilities, a nod to Joe Johnson may well be part of the solution to rebuilding the country. Each person holds an individual responsibility to promote peace. More understanding is the answer, more finding common ground, more forgiveness.

January 24, 2006, our family went from watching the nightly news to being the news story, that day, my niece Jennifer Kesse was abducted in Orlando, Fla. and our lives changed forever.

On the morning of Jan. 24 Jenn failed to report to her job as a finance manager at a well-known timeshare company. She was 24 years old. She was last heard from at around 10 p.m. the night before when she spoke by phone with her family and boyfriend from inside her condominium.

In the weeks following Jenn’s abduction, during the day, our family and friends were busy doing everything we could to raise awareness and handing out missing person flyers at major road intersections, posting them in businesses, and going door to door in the neighborhoods near Jenn’s condo. We were encouraged daily by people who came to help a family in need, a family they didn’t know.

Most nights, I was exhausted physically and emotionally, lying in bed trying to fall asleep, but my mind would not turn off. Thoughts bounced from trying to make sense of what happened to Jennifer to my marriage, business, and kids. Those nights were filled with tears, as my emotions were on hyperdrive, trying to process everything that was happening.

JENNIFER KESSE DISAPPEARANCE: POLICE PHOTOS SUGGEST VIOLENT STRUGGLE

Those restless nights felt more like a wrestling match with my past while being confronted with the brutal facts of my present reality. Facing reality is painful, but I would learn that it is also beneficial, restorative, and transformative if embraced.

I began crying out to God, which in itself is puzzling since I had walked away from church when I was 14 years old. It has been said that pain is God’s megaphone, and it turns out to be true. He now had my undivided attention. I was approaching my 50th birthday in May 2006 and facing the most desperate and challenging crisis in my life with nowhere to go and no one to turn to but God.

I bared my heart and soul to Him, just like I would with my best friends. For the first time in my life, I acknowledged how out of control my life was while feeling powerless to fix the mess I had created. I was forced to confront the truth about my life in a different way, in a way I would never have chosen.

Every night I prayed desperately for Jennifer to be brought home safely, to have the life she deserved. In those moments, I asked God to take my life so that Jenn could have hers back.

I had hit rock bottom. One night, I remember experiencing a sense of peace during my conversations with God that defied my current circumstances. It felt odd, bizarre. How could this be? How do I have peace when everything in and around me is in turmoil? What did this all mean?

ROBERT JEFFRESS: DON’T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF PRAYER, NO MATTER WHAT OTHERS SAY

Pain is indeed a megaphone. I opened my heart to hear what God was saying and embraced a new life He offered. By His grace, I was inspired to write a book, ""Aftermath of Jennifer Kesse’s Abduction: An Uncle’s Inspiring Journey and Other Stories of Hope.""

In the book, I share my 16-year journey of life transformation, from selfish to selfless, authentically and vulnerably, and introduce readers to inspirational stories of people who overcame unimaginable obstacles.

Inspired hope is not wishful thinking but a confident expectation only found in one person through an intimate relationship that lasts our lifetime. This hope is anchored to a person and a promise - the person of Jesus and the promise - that if you believe in Jesus, you will have life; an authentic and meaningful life resulting from being rescued, redeemed, and restored to a right relationship with God that will positively impact all the relationships in your life.

I need that confident hope and thankfully God gave the strength and patience to persevere over the past 16 plus years. I knew I wasn’t the person I wanted to be, nor was I the husband and father my family deserved.

The road I traveled included some rocky paths, some slippery slopes, and some uncomfortable terrain that was my life and relationships at that time. As I pursued my new life and preferred future, some of the people in my life may not be happy, it made them uncomfortable. Some believed it was my latest fad. Over time it became obvious it was not.

Thankfully, my wife and family never gave up on me, and most people in my life encouraged and cheer me on to finish strong.

If you would like to change the narrative direction of your life, I found the best place to start is with ourselves. Having focused on becoming the person I wished other people were, I was transformed into a better version of myself, and honestly, I cringe thinking about my old self. Know that I will be cheering you on so that you finish strong!

I do have one request -- that you keep my sister Joyce, my brother-in-law, Drew, and my nephew Logan and his family in your prayers because as of the date of this writing, Jennifer is still missing, vanished without a trace.

One of my objectives for writing this book is that the person or people who were involved in Jennifer’s abduction would know that no matter what they have done, the final chapter of their life stories has not been written.

The head of the Anglican Communion attempted to reinforce the church's stance against homosexual marriage this week, but the move was squashed by outcry from various bishops.

The controversy came to a head during the ongoing 2022 Lambeth Conference — a rare meeting of Anglican Communion bishops from around the world.

The Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches (GSFA) — self-described as ""a worldwide fellowship of orthodox Anglican Provinces and Dioceses within the Anglican Communion"" — came to the conference with the gay marriage ban firmly on their agenda.

""We often feel that our voices are not listened to, or respected,"" South Sudanese Primate Rev. Justin Badi told The Church Times. ""Today, in Canterbury, we may be ‘gathered together’, but we most certainly cannot ‘walk together’ until Provinces which have gone against scripture — and the will of the consensus of the bishops — repent and return to orthodoxy.""

QUEEN ELIZABETH SNUBS PRINCE HARRY, PRAISES PRINCES CHARLES, WILLIAM FOR HONORING PRINCE PHILLIP'S CLIMATE WORK

He continued, ""The Communion is not in a healthy condition at present, and only major surgery will put that right.""

They were bolstered in private, if not publicly, by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. The archbishop, by the nature of his office, is the most senior cleric in the Anglican Communion but holds limited powers of governance on his own.

POPE FRANCIS WARNS GERMAN BISHOPS: CHANGING TEACHINGS IS 'NOT LAWFUL,' CAUSES CHURCHES TO 'ROT AND DIE'

Welby met with the GSFA in private on July 29 and offered to write a letter backing the traditional view of marriage, according to Anglican Church journalist George Conger. A call was scheduled for the conference — a sort of vote amongst the bishops to endorse or abandon proposed belief statements.

The next day — after word got out about the push for a formal rejection of homosexual marriage — the conference was threatened with chaos.

Many bishops reportedly stayed seated and did not receive the Eucharist during the mass. Protests against recording votes on church calls arose, and eventually, the conference ceased keeping track of individual bishops' decisions.

The call to reinforce Lambeth 1.10 was eventually dropped.

However, there was no demonstration against the archbishop nor the conference, and proceedings continued.

Despite the fervor, Welby made good on his promised letter, released to the faithful on Tuesday.

""I wanted to write this letter to you now so that I can clarify two matters for all of us. Given the deep differences that exist within the Communion over same-sex marriage and human sexuality, I thought it important to set down what is the case,"" Welby wrote in his letter.

REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM AND THE BILLY GRAHAM EVANGELISTIC ASSOCIATION SHOW CHRISTIANS' STRUGGLES IN UKRAINE AMID WAR

He continued, ""I write therefore to affirm that the validity of the resolution passed at the Lambeth Conference 1998, 1:10 is not in doubt and that whole resolution is still in existence. Indeed the Call on Human Dignity made clear this is the case, as the resolution is quoted from three times in the paragraph 2.3 of the Call on Human Dignity.""

The archbishop went on to point out that the 1998 statues cited did not make mention of sanctions or exclusions based on obedience. Welby said that the ""Pain, anxiety, and contention"" caused by Lambeth 1.10 was ""very clear.""

He concluded, ""To be reconciled to one another across such divides is not something we can achieve by ourselves. That is why, as we continue to reflect on 1 Peter, I pray that we turn our gaze towards Christ who alone has the power to reconcile us to God and to one another.""

Anglicanism has been fracturing for decades over gay relationships, women's ordination and other issues. Those rifts blew wide open in 2003 when the New York-based Episcopal Church consecrated the first openly gay bishop, Gene Robinson, in New Hampshire.

The year prior, the top U.S. Episcopal legislative body, or General Convention, voted to authorize gay marriages in their churches.

In 2009, Anglican national leaders in Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and other church provinces helped create the Anglican Church in North America, as a theologically conservative alternative to the U.S. Episcopal Church.

Anglicans, whose roots are in the missionary work of the Church of England, are the third-largest grouping of Christians in the world, behind Roman Catholics and the Orthodox.

Jury deliberations in the New Hampshire trial of a truck driver charged with killing seven motorcyclists began Tuesday after closing statements raised questions about who was more ""all over the place"": the trucker accused of swerving back and forth across the road or the eyewitnesses accused of contradicting each other.

Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, 26, of West Springfield, Massachusetts, faces negligent homicide, manslaughter and reckless conduct charges in connection with the June 21, 2019, crash that killed seven members of a Marine motorcycle club.

MASSACHUSETTS TRUCK DRIVER WHOSE CRASH KILLED 7 MOTORCYCLISTS APPEARS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TRIAL

Prosecutors have argued that Zhukovskyy, who had taken heroin, fentanyl and cocaine that day, repeatedly swerved back and forth before the head-on crash and told police he caused it. But a judge dismissed eight charges related to whether he was impaired, and his attorneys blame the lead biker, Albert ""Woody"" Mazza, who was among those killed.

""He was drunk, he was not looking where he was going, he lost control of his motorcycle and slid in front of Vlad Zhukovskyy’s truck. Al Mazza caused this accident. Vlad Zhukovskyy is not guilty,"" defense attorney Jay Duguay said in closing statements.

""There is no doubt that this accident was a tragedy,"" Duguay said. ""But we are not here to decide whether or not this was a tragedy.""

Duguay accused prosecutors of ignoring that their own accident reconstruction unit contradicted their theory that Zhukovskyy crossed into the oncoming lane. An expert hired by the defense, meanwhile, testified that the crash happened on the center line of the road and would have occurred even if the truck was in the middle of its lane because Mazza’s motorcycle was heading in that direction.

""From the beginning of this investigation, the state had made up their mind about what had happened, evidence be damned,"" said Duguay, who also highlighted inconsistencies between witness accounts or when witnesses contradicted themselves.

TRUCK DRIVER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE CRASH THAT KILLED 7 BIKERS WAS ON DRUGS, REPORT SAYS

""Those witnesses were all over the place about what they recalled and what they claimed to have seen,"" he said.

In particular, Duguay suggested that members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club ""shaded"" their accounts to protect Mazza and the club. Prosecutor Scott Chase acknowledged some inconsistencies but asked jurors to remember the circumstances.

""People were covering the dead, trying to save the barely living, comforting the dying. This wasn’t story time,"" he said. ""They were up here talking about some of the most unimaginable chaos, trauma, death and carnage that we can even imagine three years later. They were talking about hell broke open.""

Witnesses were consistent, he argued, in describing the truck as weaving back and forth before the crash. That behavior continued ""until he killed people,"" Chase said.

""That’s what stopped him. It’s not that he made some responsible decision to start paying attention or do the right thing,"" he said. ""The only thing that stopped him was an embankment after he tore through a group of motorcycles.""

Chase called the attempt to blame Mazza a ""fanciful story"" and ""frivolous distraction,"" while reminding jurors that Zhukovskyy, who didn’t testify at trial, told investigators, ""Obviously, I caused the crash.""

""He was crystal clear from the very beginning that he caused this crash,"" Chase said. ""That is what he said because that is what happened.""

The motorcyclists who died were from New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island and ranged in age from 42 to 62. They were part of a larger group that had just left a motel along U.S. Route 2 in Randolph.

A Missouri man has been charged with shooting and killing his neighbor following an argument over lawn mowing, bringing to an end years of hostility between the two, officials said.

Samuel Avery, 42, of Kansas City, was charged Monday with second-degree murder and armed criminal action in the killing of 41-year-old Warner Trotter, who was shot in his head on his front porch, the Jackson County Prosecutor's office said. Trotter was declared dead at hospital.

According to court documents, Avery called police on Sunday to report that he had shot his neighbor. Officers found Avery on his porch next door and arrested him without incident.

Online court records do not list an attorney who can speak for Avery.

Police said officers had been called to the men's homes twice previously because they were arguing over Avery mowing his lawn too early in the day. No one was arrested during those incidents. According to a probable cause statement, Avery told investigators they had been arguing for 10 years.

On the day of the shooting, Trotter complained that Avery's lawn mower was too loud and made a gesture with his hand that he would shoot Avery, according to court documents. Avery said he called the police and was told nothing could be done, then Trotter waved an actual gun around and said nothing would happen to him.

Then she heard several shots.

Avery told police that Trotter reached for a gun before Avery started firing his weapon, according to records.

Footage from security cameras at Trotter's home show him saying something to Avery then starting to enter the house when Avery fired at Trotter several times, according to the statement.

The video clearly shows Trotter did not reach for his weapon at any time, according to the probable cause statement. It also said first responding officers removed a weapon from Trotter’s waistband before emergency responders began treating him.

Kellogg's cereal company is the largest cereal distributor in the United States with its origins dating back to the late 19th century.

Corn flakes were Kellogg's company's first product that made them the king of cereal and a huge player in the American breakfast market. Will and John Kellogg created the product together in order to create a digestible yet affordable breakfast meal for middle Americans. During this period, many Americans had digestible issues due to the limited number of dietary options for middle-class Americans.

Together the Kellogg brothers promoted their new product as a ""nutritious and healthful"" breakfast option, but a disagreement over whether a small detail led to them splitting apart and the creation of the Kellogg cereal company.

Why was Corn Flakes invented?

John Kellogg, and his brother, Will, invented corn flakes for patients at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in 1894. The patients enjoyed the cereal, and two years later, a patent for the recipe was granted in 1896. The two brothers eventually went their separate ways after disagreeing over whether to add sugar to the cereal.

By the 20th century, Kellogg's Cereal Company cereal was marketed for its daily health benefits and as an easily digestible meal. They also emphasize the sweet flavor of the flakes and their ""dainty crispness."" During this time, indigestion was a big concern for Americans with sensitive stomachs, especially because morning dining options were limited.

Moreover, the cereal was also invented to align with the dietary restrictions of the Seventh Day Adventist church attended by the Kellogg family.

Are corn flakes good for you?

Corn flakes were created as a healthy and easily digestible cereal that would appeal to a broad demographic of Americans. However, corn flakes like any other cereal are low in fiber even when eaten with low-fat milk, so they are not the healthiest option for a balanced breakfast. If you do eat cornflakes the healthiest option would be to combine them with a piece of fruit or snack.

What is in corn flakes?

Kellogg's is suitable for vegans due to the ingredients that make up the golden flakes which are sugar, salt, barley malt extract, and vitamin E. Approximately 90% of the context is made out of corn.

A major point of disagreement between the Kellogg brothers was over the inclusion of sugar in the product because John did not want any traces of sugar in corn flakes while his brother Will believed it would attract more customers."

An 80-year-old Washington state woman was permanently banned from her local YMCA pool after demanding that a transgender employee leave the women’s locker room, she told local media.

""I saw a man in a woman’s bathing suit watching maybe four or five little girls pulling down their suits in order to use the toilet,"" Port Townsend resident Julie Jaman recalled of the July incident to Seattle radio show host Dori Monson on Friday. ""I asked if he had a penis and he said it was none of my business. I told that man to ‘get out right now.’""

The incident occurred on July 26 at the Mountain View pool, which is a City of Port Townsend facility operated by the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, according to local news outlet Port Townsend Free Press.

Jaman said that she was alerted to the trans employee being in the women’s locker room while she was showering and ""heard a man’s voice.""

She told Monson that she alerted a pool staffer to the incident and was stunned when the staff member told her she was ""being discriminatory,"" and ""was banned from the pool forever."" The staffer also allegedly said the police would be called, according to Jaman’s radio interview.

""She didn’t ask me what the problem was, if I was okay, nothing about me,"" Jaman told Monson. ""It’s as if she was just waiting to pounce on me. It was just stunning.""

The Port Townsend Police Department told Fox News Digital that no official police report was filed, but the department provided an incident report on the matter.

The incident report details that Jaman ""had an emotional response to a strange male being in the bathroom"" near young girls, and is hoping to not be ""trespassed"" from the pool, according to a phone call an officer had with Jaman. The report also noted a phone call from the YMCA detailing that Jaman was reportedly in the facility’s locker room ""screaming"" at an employee and ""refusing to leave.""

Erin Hawkins, the marketing & communications manager for the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, told Fox News Digital that the permanent pool ban followed a build-up of incidents where Jaman violated the facility’s code of conduct. She said the permanent suspension was not solely due to the singular incident in the women's locker room last month.

""Julie Jaman was permanently suspended from the Mountain View Pool due to her repeatedly violating our Code of Conduct, specifically, using disrespectful words or gestures toward YMCA staff or others; abusive, harassing and/or obscene language or gestures toward YMCA staff or others,"" Hawkins said in comment to Fox News Digital on Monday.

Jaman told local media that she had been a member of the pool facility for 35 years and has lived in Port Townsend for about 40 years. She has voted for Democrats during her life, she told the local outlet, and considers herself an ""XX woman,"" referring to her chromosomes.

She added to the Port Townsend Free Press that she recoiled at being naked and showering in a room with a person born male. She added that the ""momma bear in me"" came out when she saw the individual near the young girls in the bathroom.

Jaman added that she also spoke with the CEO of the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, Wendy Bart, and said that she told Bart there should be warnings that the bathrooms were also used by trans individuals.

​​""I told her there were no signs posted to give women warning,"" Jaman told Monson. ""She said there were Pride posters posted all over and she assumed that was adequate to inform women what to expect."" Bart also said, ""‘we take pride and everyone is welcome,’"" according to Jaman’s description of the conversation.

""That’s fine with me, except that they do not provide alternatives for women who choose not to be undressing in front of men,"" Jaman continued in the radio interview. ""Our pool is a very old pool. We just have two shower rooms, dressing rooms, one for men, one for women.""

One veteran is still fighting for America — and for himself.

Brandon Rumbaugh appeared on ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" on Sunday morning to share his story of staying fit after his military service — and after becoming a double amputee.

What's clear is that his toughness and strength are continuing to keep him healthy in every way — something others can do as well, no matter their circumstances, especially with him and others as inspiration.

Rumbaugh lost both legs during his service in Afghanistan — he was actually at the hospital together with Johnny Joey Jones, Fox News contributor.

He said that the two of them have come so far in terms of their recovery and their fitness levels. That ""makes me happy,"" he said.

CrossFit helped him with his journey to recovery, he said.

The Semper Fi & America's Fund ""was created by a compassionate group of military spouses,"" its website says.

""Those same women run The Fund today, alongside other spouses and retired service members from all service branches.""

The group has helped over 28,000 veterans around the country, Rumbaugh emphasized.

""If you just put your mind to it and get in there and do it, we can accomplish anything.""

He said, ""It's crazy. There are vets [out there] today that don't know about us"" — and they need to, he said, so that they can get the help and support they deserve.

He said that going to the group's website, TheFund.org, ""is the easiest way to learn about us,"" he said. Anyone can donate as well to help America's vets.

""Being able to go to the gym and let out some of [the] frustration, some of that aggression … If you just put your mind to it and get in there and do it, we can accomplish anything,"" he added.

He then ran through some key presses with kettlebells with the ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" co-hosts on Sunday, July 31, 2022.

They worked not only on muscle development, but also on their abs.

""Everything is circuit-based,"" he said about CrossFit.

""Not only are we working on muscles, we're going to get our cardio up and our breathing up as well.""

He said the key is to ""keep moving, keep that heart rate up,"" he said.

""Supporting all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, we provide one-on-one case management, connection and lifetime support.""

""We served in the Marine Corps — we did our time,"" he said.

""But now we're serving our country, our people, in a different way — by showing people that we're not out of the fight. We're still here,"" he said.

""These veterans around the country need support and help,"" Rumbaugh also said.

""It's all about movement,"" he said, in terms of workouts and staying healthy.

Getting more exercise could be linked to a longer life.

A new 12-page research article published in the American Heart Association’s Circulation Journal found that people who got extra exercise had a lower mortality rate compared to those who did not.

The study, which was conducted by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, was published on Monday, July 25.

Over a 30-year period from 1988 to 2018, a total of 116,221 adults were monitored and submitted exercise reports that detailed their ""leisure-time physical activity.""

HOW TO EXERCISE DURING A WORK TRIP AND STAY FIT WHILE TRAVELING

Mortality reduction was observed in study participants who got 150 to 300 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week and 300 to 600 minutes of moderate physical activity.

Vigorous exercisers who participated in activities like jogging, running, climbing stairs, swimming, bicycling, aerobics, playing sports and working outdoors for 150 to 299 minutes, had a lower mortality rate between 21% and 23% for all causes of death.

This exercise group also had lower cardiovascular deaths between 27% and 33% and lower non-cardiovascular deaths by 19%. People who exercised vigorously for more than 300 minutes per week ""did not have further lower mortality,"" according to the study.

Moderate exercisers, on the other hand, who participated in activities like walking, weightlifting performing lower-intensity workouts and calisthenics for 150 to 299 minutes, had a lower mortality rate between 20% and 21% for all causes of death.

PREDIABETIC YOUNG ADULTS MIGHT HAVE HIGHER HEART ATTACK RISK: REPORT

In terms of cardiovascular deaths, moderate exercisers had a 22% to 25% lower chance, and for non-cardiovascular deaths, moderate exercisers had a 19% to 20% lower chance.

People who exercised moderately for 300 to 599 minutes per week had ""3% to 13% further lower mortality,"" according to the study.

Researchers behind the study documented 47,596 deaths during its observation.

""The nearly maximum association with lower mortality was achieved by performing ≈150 to 300 min/wk of long-term leisure-time [vigorous physical activity], 300 to 600 min/wk of long-term leisure-time [moderate physical activity], or an equivalent combination of both,"" the team wrote in the study’s conclusion.

STRENGTH TRAINING 30-60 MINUTES A WEEK COULD BE LINKED TO LONGER LIFE: STUDY

However, the study’s participants were pulled from surveys collected by the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which may have skewed results.

Most of the study participants were in their 60s, had a normal BMI, rarely ate more than 2,000 calories per day, drank alcohol occasionally and hardly smoked.

There was a lack of racial diversity as well with more than 90% of study participants being White.

The U.S. Department of Health recommends 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous activity per week and 150 to 300 minutes of moderate activity per week.

If you’re traveling for work these days, make sure to keep your fitness goals in mind.

Your itinerary could include early-morning sales calls, late-day business meetings — and also long lunches, late-night meals entertaining clients and even follow-up work at night in your hotel room.

Research from the American Council on Exercise says that exercise increases alertness and productivity and also boosts moods — which can create a better mindset for business travel.

CAREER CHALLENGE: SHOULD YOU SOCIALIZE WITH YOUR BOSS OUTSIDE OF THE WORKPLACE?

While you’re traveling, fitness experts say you don’t need fancy gyms, pricey equipment or an abundance of free time to incorporate fitness into your business travel schedule. To make sure get some exercise in while you're away, try these smart tips.

1. Use the hotel's amenities if you can

Aim for a hotel with a gym, a pool and one that’s in a pedestrian-friendly location.

You can swim laps in the pool, use cardio equipment and do weight-training in the fitness center and walk around the area where your hotel is located.

As a fitness professional who travels to certify trainers around the country, Cary Williams, CEO of Boxing & Barbells in Santa Monica, California, said she does her best to book a hotel with a gym when she’s traveling.

However, if you can’t find a hotel that offers all these amenities — don’t worry.

THESE ARE THE BEST FOODS FOR YOUR HEART, EXPERTS SAY

""If there is not a gym or the gym is closed, there are plenty of exercises you can do in your room without equipment,"" Williams said.

Also, to get your steps in, skip the elevator and use the stairs, she advised.

2. Do an in-room workout

The best plan, said Williams, is to set your alarm an hour earlier while out of town so that you have at least a good 30-45 minutes to get in a workout.

She recommends an interval type of workout with about six exercises: three body weight exercises and three cardio-types of exercises.

""Find a timer app on your phone and set it for 45 seconds of work time and 15 second rest time between exercises,"" she said.

Williams curated an example of a room workout. She said each of the following exercises should take six minutes (aim for five rounds): squats; knee ups (high knees in place); push-ups; jumping rope (bring you own); lunges; and sit-ups.

You can add some weights to your workout if you have your own — or you can use dumbbells from the hotel’s gym.

3. Explore your surroundings

Chelsea Cohen, co-founder of SoStocked, in Austin, Texas, said fitness is a vital part of her daily routine. When she is traveling for work, her goal is to ensure the same.

""Exploring keeps me fit,"" said Cohen. ""Each business trip comes with a new opportunity to explore and indulge in exciting activities.""

She added, ""Whenever I’m in a new city, I make sure that I walk around a bit whether it’s for shopping or finding a good restaurant.""

Cohen said she prioritizes taking a walking path to her work meetings.

HOW TO KNOW IF YOUR SUNSCREEN IS EXPIRED

""This helps keep my body in motion,"" she said. ""The best thing is that walking keeps my mind off the usual workouts and gives me the much-needed exercise without needing to carve extra time for it.""

Outside work meetings, pack a pair of sneakers and walk the area to learn about the new city and explore.

4. Embrace technology

As CEO of Brooklyn, NY-based MediaPeanut, Victoria Mendoza said she frequently travels for business; technology has helped keep her on track in terms of her fitness and health.

""I have recently learned to incorporate technology into my own fitness regimen,"" she said.

She uses several apps to help her with calorie counting, measuring calories burned during exercise and daily activities — and also measuring her daily steps and monitoring her exercise activities.

""Some of these popular apps are Fooducate, Strides, MyFitnessPal and Fitbit aside from the health trackers in my phone,"" she added.

""Setting aside an hour for a virtual fitness trainer session allows me to not stray from my fitness goals and correctly do my workouts, even with limited machines.""

Also, Mendoza said she’s hired virtual fitness trainers who monitor her fitness activities and plan her workouts at least twice or three times a week, even while she travels for work.

""Setting aside an hour for a virtual fitness trainer session allows me to not stray from my fitness goals and correctly do my workouts, even with limited machines."" She said the virtual trainers come up with ""exercise plans depending on the location and time and space that I have at my disposal.""

5. Cycle your way to health

Jarelle Parker, a Silicon Valley personal trainer in Menlo Park, California, suggested booking a bike tour around a new city.

""This is a great way to meet people and to be adventurous by exploring a new environment,"" she said. ""It's also a great way to incorporate fitness into your travel.""

She mentioned that Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, New York and San Diego ""have amazing bike tours for fitness travelers.""

If indoor cycling is more the preference (along with others to help motivate you), Parker noted that the ClassPass app can help.

Ella Halikas has gone viral for recreating some of Julia Fox’s most daring looks – but for the SI Swimsuit model, it was a no-brainer.

""I remember she was wearing the low-rise look, and I was like, ‘Ooh, the low-rise is coming back,’"" the 24-year-old chuckled to Fox News Digital. ""And I remember people who were a lot curvier were scared of that. I would come across videos on TikTok of girls saying, ‘There’s no way I’m participating in this trend. I don’t have the right body.’ My first thought was, ‘Why not?’ Obviously, we have different body types, but I also love to showcase my body. And I thought if I could wear this, someone else might feel they can too. We can feel just as confident and beautiful together. I wanted to start that conversation.""

The curve model took to Instagram where she posted side-by-side photos of herself and Fox, 32, wearing similar looks. Some pieces Halikas wore included black and white Calvin Klein underwear while grocery shopping, as well as a cropped white tank top and a mini skirt paired with black patent gloves and boots – two recognizable styles from the fellow model.

Halikas said she received an overwhelming amount of support after the photos went viral.

""I wanted to show people you can rock whatever you want, you can feel just as confident and beautiful,"" the California native shared. ""I wanted other girls to be seen. I wanted others to feel good in their skin and be encouraged to try wearing something they feel they could never wear. I’ve gotten such a great reaction from people, and they’re loving it. I mean, it takes time, effort and money to organize all these shoots that are unpaid. But it’s a great feeling to know it’s encouraging others to showcase their bodies.""

According to Halikas, she actually went to a grocery store in Beverly Hills to mimic Fox’s supermarket look.

""The secret to making Julia Fox’s look – or any look for that matter – your own is confidence,"" she explained. ""It’s not so much about body type. It’s about how you carry yourself. It’s not about how you look physically. It’s about how you feel mentally. You have to walk with your chest up high and feel good. When you see the photos, you have to feel the confidence, the energy. That’s what makes people go, ‘She looks good.’ If I had walked to that store all covered up and my chin down looking nervous, people would say, ‘That’s not flattering, put some clothes on. What are you doing?’ You have to own your body and you have to own your look. If you can have that mental shift and find that confidence, then you can pull off anything.""

Halikas said the ""Uncut Gems"" star has not reached out to her personally after the photos went viral, but she has seen them.

""She would look at my Stories [on Instagram],"" Halikas explained. ""She liked both of my posts. She’s just never commented or personally reach out… But this isn’t really about mimicking a celebrity or about Julia Fox personally. It’s more about recreating a style and showing it on a different body type. I would love to start doing different celebrities and other thinner women like Bella Hadid. ""

The star first made a splash in 2021 when she was photographed by veteran photographer Yu Tsai in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for SI Swimsuit. Halikas, who has been inspired by Ashley Graham and Hunter McGrady, said it has always been a dream of hers to appear in the magazine.

""The shoot just felt like a dream,"" she recalled. ""I even connected with Ashley Graham. She sent me a voice message the morning of my shoot. I remember she said, ‘I’m so proud of you, you should be proud of yourself. You’ve come so far.’ I just started crying. I stayed up late the night before my shoot watching videos of her modeling on YouTube to get some inspiration. So I couldn’t believe my role model was cheering me on. I felt empowered. What I love about this brand is that the girls are so uplifting and encouraging. You couldn’t find a more supportive sisterhood.""

""I remember when the magazine finally came out, I was searching all around San Francisco where I was for a shoot, going to every Walgreens, CVS, library, Barnes & Noble,"" Halikas continued. ""I couldn’t find it anywhere. After hours of searching, I had to go to the airport and get on a flight to Miami. I went to a newsstand there and saw it on the wall. I immediately grabbed it. I got a full page in the issue… I was so proud that I made it that far.""

Today, Halikas hopes that her body will serve as an inspiration to other women who ""deserve to be seen"" in the fashion industry.

""It’s been super important for me to talk about the difference between body positivity and body neutrality,"" she explained. ""Body positivity is when you accept your body, not really wanting to change it. Body neutrality means you love your body, but you’re OK with change too. I’m more neutral. I love my body, and I’m very positive about it, but there are things that I believe can make me stronger. I’m always looking to be the best version of myself… I enjoy working out and for me, it’s way more than just trying to lose weight. I’m not even thinking about weight or needing to lose. I’m thinking, ‘How can I get more toned? How can I feel healthier? How can I help my anxiety? How can I improve my mental health?’""

The model shared that she relies on consistent Pilates and weight-lifting to challenge herself, all while improving her mental health. She is also an avid fan of soccer, hot yoga and the occasional jog.

""The advice I would give to anyone who is intimidated by the gym is that nobody in there is worried about you,"" she advised. ""They’re more into themselves. In life, we always think people are looking at us and judging, whether it’s when we’re wearing a new outfit or at the gym. Most people, especially nowadays, are just so concerned with themselves. If you’re intimidated, get a workout buddy or meet with a trainer. If the weight room looks scary because it’s just a bunch of guys, hop on a treadmill. You can also go to a room alone and do some cardio. I also go to a Pilates class, and I’m probably the biggest girl there… but in a way, it empowers me. I’m thinking, ‘Yeah, I’m twice your size, but look what I can do.’ Health and fitness look different in every single body. I’m all about feeling strong to be my best self.""

""More importantly, don’t compare yourself to others, especially when everyone is out right now wearing a bikini,"" she said. ""There’s so much power in just being you. You are unique. Don’t lose sight of that. It’s easier said than done, but it’s not fun comparing yourself to everyone else. Embrace who you are and what you’re capable of."""

The shoot took place at their family home in Turks and Caicos. While Brinkley has led a successful career being in the spotlight, she still faced some insecurities posing once more in bikinis.

""The second you start thinking about being in ‘Sports Illustrated’ you start thinking about, ‘Oh, do we stack up?’"" Brinkley explained. ""Everybody gets a little insecure. It was kind of interesting for everybody to be together there and sort of address their insecurities and get it out there.""

""My girls have both had different fears having grown up in front of the scrutiny of the press, so I think it was fraught with a little bit of anxiety,"" she continued. ""But it was cathartic, I think. Everybody enjoyed the moment and having that experience together.""

Brinkley noted that having a positive outlook on life has been essential over the years.

""I’ve always been of the school of, ‘You just got to be grateful for whatever you got. You’ve got two arms, two legs, two eyes,’"" she said. ""It’s silly to stress about anything else. Be grateful. So what if it’s five pounds up, it’s you and it’s all good.""

These days, Brinkley is grateful that the modeling industry has become more inclusive over the years.

""The most beautiful thing about this beauty industry is that its arms are wide open trying to make sure that they embrace and celebrate every size, shape, age, race,"" she said. ""And that they see themselves and find themselves on the pages and feel good about themselves.""

Because sometimes I don’t know what’s OK to wear,'"" she said. ""And I try and give people the message that, if you feel good in it, then it’s OK.""

Back in April 2021, Brinkley told Fox News Digital she hoped her latest swimsuit snaps, which often go viral, will inspire other women to celebrate themselves — no matter their age.

""I post these pictures because I hear from women my age all the time that say, ‘Thank you for changing the way people think about the numbers,’"" Brinkley said at the time. ""Back in the day, numbers represented something. I remember people thinking that after 30, you should never wear your hair past your shoulders or your hemline needed to hover your knee caps.""

""I’ve always found those rules so limiting,"" she said. ""Everybody’s different, everybody’s unique. But it’s like telling a gymnast she can’t do flips past a certain age. It doesn’t make sense. If you’ve got great legs, show them. If there’s something about yourself that you really love, celebrate that. Don’t be controlled by those numbers.""

Kelly Hughes made history this summer when she became the first model to bare her cesarean-section scar for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition in the magazine's 58-year history.

The outlet partnered with Frida Mom to raise awareness of Pay With Change, an initiative aimed to ""positively shift the mainstream cultural narratives associated with women’s bodies – especially when becoming a mom.""

The proud model and mom wore a nude-hued skimpy string bikini for the 2022 issue which features Kim Kardashian, Maye Musk, Ciara and Yumi Nu as this year’s cover girls.

Hughes delivered her now 3-year-old son via cesarean. She joins Katrina Scott, 2021’s Rookie of the Year, who was photographed when she was six and a half months pregnant, as well as Hunter McGrady, who posed for the outlet six months postpartum.

SI SWIMSUIT ISSUE MAKES HISTORY WITH MODEL KELLY HUGHES BARING C-SECTION SCAR: ‘OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME’

After Hughes' photo went viral, the founder and designer of the jewelry brand HÜES partnered with ESTAS Beauty to start the #ScarLoveChallenge on social media to spread a feeling of empowerment and change the societal stigma around scars. The challenge encourages participants to reinterpret Hughes' photo showing off their scars. Every time a #ScarLoveChallenge photo is posted, ESTAS will donate $1 to World of Children, helping disadvantaged children around the globe.

Hughes spoke to Fox News Digital about the struggles she endured during labor, the insecurities she faced after giving birth, as well as how she now responds to negative comments on Instagram.

Fox News: How did you get involved with SI Swimsuit?

Kelly Hughes: One of my friends in New York, who is also a model, saw that they were looking for a girl with a C-section scar, and they were shooting in the Florida Keys, which is close to me as I’m in Miami. I reached out to my agency, they proposed me and that’s how I got the job. It’s so wonderful because my friend is also a mother. And without her, I wouldn’t have gotten this opportunity. So it’s beautiful to see one mother supporting another mother.

Fox News: Take us back to your shoot. What was that like?

Hughes: I had a million things running through my mind before I even started shooting. I had never shown my scar before. And I have been really open with how I struggled with insecurities around my scar. I originally didn’t want a C-section because the bounce back was going to be much harder being that I’m a model.

Society just puts so much pressure on you to ""bounce back."" I wasn’t a size two anymore. I wasn’t doing too much modeling in a bikini in the first place. So it was scary at first to show my biggest insecurity in a magazine like Sports Illustrated. I wasn’t sure how I was going to be received.

Fox News: How were you received on set?

Hughes: As soon as I arrived, the editor just made me feel so confident and beautiful. She turned my insecurity into the most beautiful thing in the world. She just made me feel so much better about my scar. I felt so much more confident about myself. I just looked at my scar in the mirror and I realized I shouldn’t have to feel so insecure about this anymore. And when it was time to shoot, everyone reacted the same way. They made me feel so empowered and inspired. I imagine how many beautiful women they’ve seen, and now I get to be part of that representation. The experience was a healing one for me. It just really helped me to overcome my insecurities.

Fox News: How important was it for you to show off your C-section scar despite your insecurities?

Hughes: To be honest, I had no idea how much this would impact people. But my photo went viral all over the world. This is something I probably wouldn’t have done before, but I also didn’t see myself in the same way I see myself now. And I think it’s beautiful that a magazine like Sports Illustrated is showing a woman with a C-section and saying, ""she’s beautiful."" Now, I realize how important that photo is to me because I had no idea how underrepresented this was.

Apparently, one in three women are having C-sections now – that’s a large number of women. But this doesn’t just resonate with women who have C-sections. This also resonates with women who have scars in general and are insecure about them. The fashion industry has evolved, and they’re finally starting to embrace different women. We don’t have to all look the same. So this photo represents so much more than a C-section scar… I feel a true responsibility to continue this conversation.

FITNESS ICON DENISE AUSTIN, 65, AND DAUGHTER KATIE MODEL BIKINIS FOR SI SWIMSUIT RUNWAY SHOW: ‘PROUD MAMA’

Fox News: What went through your mind when you saw your photo for the first time?

Hughes: I just kept saying ""wow"" *laughs*. I will never forget that moment. We shot with six different bathing suits that day to have options. And for some reason, the moment I shot that picture, I just knew it was going to be chosen. It just shows pure joy. And I think that’s what we should feel when we look at our scars. It represents we overcame something difficult, and we’re here.

You know in the fashion industry, nobody wants to show cellulite. Nobody wants to show scars. But these things are normal, and they should be normalized. And when you see my photo, you just see pure joy. I was so insecure about my scar, but it also represents the most beautiful moment of my life because my son was born. So I should feel joy.

Fox News: Some critics have said, ""SI Swimsuit is a magazine of women in bikinis. Do we really need to see this?"" What would you tell those people?

Hughes: It’s interesting, I was shocked that about 99% of people that reached out to me have been supportive. Even the press I received after my photo went viral was supportive. Sure, sometimes people like to make their comments – it is Instagram – but I’ve gotten an overwhelming number of positive comments from both men and women. Of course, you still get comments like ""who cares?"" or ""she’s half-naked"" or ""we don’t want to see this"" – all those comments are generic. And the truth is, there will always be people out there who want to dim your light.

All I can say is I don’t understand how someone can make negative comments, especially on someone’s social media posts. There’s no need for it. You don’t gain anything from that. But the overwhelming amount of positive comments from people proves that something like this was needed. This is about representation. Think about those mothers out there with C-section scars wearing a bikini at the beach. Sometimes it peeks out.

SI SWIM MODEL VICTORIA VESCE RECALLS OVERCOMING ‘NIGHTMARE’ BRAIN TUMOR: ‘I HAD EVERY SYMPTOM IN THE BOOK’

I’ve received so many messages from women telling me they’ve felt so insecure going to the beach that they buy a bigger bikini or just choose to wear a one-piece to avoid the scrutiny. They go out of their way to not show the scar because they’re insecure about it. They’re worried about what people may say or think. Now, Sports Illustrated is having that conversation. It was so needed. You shouldn’t need to accommodate everyone else just so they can feel better. You’re so much more than any negative comment someone may have to say.

Now, I’m getting messages from women telling me how empowered they feel, and how confident they feel to wear that bikini again after having a baby. I hope that when people see my photo, they’ll feel encouraged to embrace themselves and give themselves grace. I look at my scar now, and I’m proud of what I went through. I embrace it. I’m still here. And that’s exactly what my photo shows. I just hope it can encourage others to feel the same.

Fox News: In 2018 you became a mom. But it sounded like you endured some challenges. What happened?

Hughes: My son was born in November 2018. During my pregnancy, I had nausea and all the typical things, but it wasn’t anything severe. I had a good pregnancy and I thought I was going to have a natural labor. I have read everything about natural labor, and I was ready for it. I never opened the door to the possibility of a C-section. I just wanted to bounce back as quickly as possible. I knew a C-section meant a longer recovery. But when I was in labor, unfortunately [the doctors] realized that my hips weren’t aligned. They were a bit shifted, which happens a lot in pregnancy. I didn’t realize this until it was time.

I had a very long labor – I was about 36 hours in, and I wasn’t dilating past seven centimeters. That’s when they recommended a C-section. At first, I was like, ""no, no, no."" But that was my first lesson in motherhood – you can’t plan for everything. I didn’t want to put my son’s health at risk or of course, my own. So I finally agreed. But two days later after I went home, I became really sick. I went back to the hospital, and it turned out I had a really bad infection. I spent eight days in the hospital and I underwent another surgery to remove the infection. Being separated from my son was so difficult. I wasn’t in the maternity unit anymore, and they didn’t want him in the hospital.

SI SWIM SEARCH FINALIST KRISTEN LOUELLE GAFFNEY, MOM OF TWO, UNVEILS CURVES ON MIAMI RUNWAY: 'MAGICAL MOMENT'

I just felt horrible. Like why did this happen to me? What did I do wrong? New moms especially, we put a lot of pressure on ourselves because we just want everything to be perfect. And the truth is, I don’t think this is discussed enough. There needs to be more conversations and education on all the million things that can happen during labor. But the most important thing is for mom and baby to be healthy. I wanted this perfect, natural birth to happen. It didn’t – and that’s OK. My son is here and so am I.

Fox News: After you gave birth and were recovering, did you still feel pressure to ""bounce back"" or look a certain way?

Hughes: I wish I could tell you that pressure went away I gave birth. It definitely didn’t. And I’m very honest about this… I’ve been modeling for 22 years. I have seen the fashion industry evolve in the last year and a half. But that shift hadn’t happened when I gave birth in November 2018. I did feel that pushback when I tried going back to work. I didn’t look the same as I did before. I certainly didn’t have the confidence.

I was very insecure. And I don’t think I was fully embraced quite yet. As a mom, you don’t always have time to go to the gym. Sometimes you don’t have time at all. And eating became whatever was in the house or whatever I could grab quickly, so I could get back to my son. My diet had changed. My routine had changed. The demands of my life had changed. But the truth is, once you give birth to a new person, you are not the same. So you shouldn’t feel pressure to be the same as you were before… It took time to finally embrace my scar and that’s OK. I no longer feel like I should be ashamed of it.

Fox News: What’s motherhood like today?

Hughes: It’s a blessing. I’m still modeling. My son and I did a photo shoot together for a company that offers clothing for breastfeeding moms. He was two months old. It was a little difficult because I wasn’t fully healed. I was still recovering from two surgeries. But it was an amazing experience. We’ve done quite a few photo shoots with him, and it’s been wonderful being with my son. He’s now three and a half, and it’s incredible.

Outside of Africa, where the virus is endemic, new cases have largely occurred among gay and bisexual men. Experts warn that the virus could spread to other populations, especially due to vaccine shortages. The World Health Organization and the United States have declared monkeypox a public health emergency.

The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), GLAAD, the National Black Justice Coalition, and the National Center for Lesbian Rights are each receiving $350,000 from Gilead for public education toward preventing and treating the virus.

The funds will help the groups produce videos, graphics and other information resources for distribution to the media and at community centers, bars, nightclubs, parties and events.

Torrian Baskerville, director of HIV and Health Equity at HRC, said the U.S. response to the virus at federal, state and local levels has been ""slow across the board.""

Actor Ashton Kutcher recently disclosed his bout with an autoimmune condition that affected his hearing, vision and ability to walk.

Access Hollywood obtained footage of an interview from Monday night’s episode of National Geographic’s ""Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge,"" in which the actor spoke about a rare autoimmune disorder he developed not long ago called vasculitis.

The 44-year-old actor said in the interview, ""Two years ago, I had this weird, super-rare form of vasculitis, that, like, knocked out my vision, it knocked out my hearing, it knocked out, like, all my equilibrium,"" according to the Access Hollywood report.

ASHTON KUTCHER REVEALS VASCULITIS DIAGNOSIS, SAYS HE COULDN'T WALK, TALK OR HEAR

Kutcher also said in the interview, ""You don’t really appreciate it until it’s gone. Until you go, ‘I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to see again, I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to hear again, I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to walk again.’""

The Vasculitis Foundation says that ""vasculitis is a general term that refers to inflammation of the blood vessels.""

It notes as well, ""It is used to describe a family of nearly 20 rare diseases, characterized by narrowing, weakening or scarring of the blood vessels, which can restrict blood flow and damage vital organs and tissues.""

The disease can affect blood vessels such as arteries, capillaries and veins.

The Center for Vasculitis Care and Research at Cleveland Clinic said on its website that vasculitis is an autoimmune disease — in which the body mistakenly attacks its own healthy tissue — that contributes to inflammation of blood vessels.

Currently, researchers believe this inflammatory response may be triggered by infections, medications, environmental or genetic factors, allergic reactions or another disease process.

The disease can affect blood vessels such as arteries, capillaries and veins — and symptoms can range from mild to severe, and vary from person to person, the Cleveland Clinic experts said.

Symptoms also depend on the tissues and organs that are affected.

The actor said it took about a year for his senses to recover, according to the media report.

Rheumatologists said while some forms of vasculitis may improve on their own, others may require medical care throughout one’s life.

Treatment of the disease depends on the specific type of vasculitis and the areas/organs that are involved, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Treatment may include the use of corticosteroids — or, in some cases, medications that suppress the immune system.

Regardless of the severity, health experts said that early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important to avoid potentially life-threatening complications.

The actor said it took about a year for his senses to recover, according to the media report. ""I’m lucky to be alive,"" Kutcher said in the interview.

Scans of blood vessels and the heart, as well as tissue biopsies, may also be performed.

Common symptoms of the disease include the following list, according to the Ceveland Clinic.

Skin rashes

Fatigue

Weakness

Fever

Joint pains

Abdominal pain

Kidney problems (including dark or bloody urine)

Nerve problems (including numbness, weakness and pain)

Cough and/or shortness of breath

Also, other symptoms can occur, depending on the area of the body affected by vasculitis.

The Cleveland experts noted that if a small blood vessel is affected, it might break, producing small areas of bleeding in the tissue that appear as small red or purple dots on the skin.

They also noted a nodule or lump might be noticeable in the skin when a larger blood vessel close to the skin surface is inflamed.

A physician can diagnose vasculitis based on symptoms, a person’s medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests. Scans of blood vessels and the heart, as well as tissue biopsies, may also be performed, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Kutcher, who shares two children with his wife Mila Kunis — whom he met when they filmed their hit TV series, ""That '70s Show"" — spoke about overcoming challenges.

""The minute you start seeing your obstacles as things that are made for you, to give you what you need, and then life starts to get fun, right?"" Kutcher said in the Bear Grylls interview, according to Access Hollywood.

Italy opened its vaccination campaign against monkeypox on Monday as case numbers have increased at a time when health authorities are reporting vaccine shortages worldwide.

Italy has reported 545 cases of monkeypox, according to the health ministry. Its vaccination campaign has started more than a month after other countries that have seen higher numbers of cases, including the United States, Britain and Spain.

The first doses will be given at the Spallanzani hospital in Rome, the hospital said in a statement.

SPAIN CONFIRMS FIRST MONKEYPOX-RELATED DEATH IN EUROPE

Vaccines and treatments have been in short supply and the disease often left for historically underfunded sexual health clinics to manage.

Spallanzani said it already has 200 people who will be vaccinated from Monday onwards, as well as 600 requests for bookings.

The vaccine used will be Jynneos (MVA-BN), a smallpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic and approved by the European Medicines Agency for protection against monkeypox, the hospital said.

On Thursday, vaccinations will also begin in Italy's financial capital, Milan.

The virus continues to be largely transmitted among gay and bisexual men in the current outbreak spreading outside endemic countries, which began in May. Monkeypox is spread chiefly by close contact, causes pus-filled sores and flu-like symptoms, and is rarely fatal. There have now been 26,500 cases worldwide outside the countries where it usually spreads, according to a Reuters tracker.

In July, the World Health Organization declared monkeypox a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" its highest alert level.

Following the WHO's move, the United States — which now has the most cases in the world — also declared monkeypox a public health emergency on Aug. 4.

Italy's Health ministry said gay, bisexual men and transgender people who have recently had sex with multiple partners, recently had a sexually transmitted infection or use chemical drugs when having sex, would be eligible for the vaccine. Hospital staff dealing with monkeypox cases are also eligible.

The first case in Italy was recorded on May 20, 2022. There are no current plans for mass vaccinations.

Frans said they could maneuver around the clouds easy enough, but once they leveled off and were on a course approaching eastern Minnesota on their way to Montana, they learned they would have to deviate north or south due to the line of thunderstorms ahead.

""Based on the weather radar, we decided to deviate north and were still getting very strong returns on the onboard weather radar,"" Frans said. ""The clouds were too tall to be able to visually determine a safe route, so we were relying on (air traffic control) reports, the satellite radar report and the onboard weather radar to attempt to navigate a safe path through.""

Frans said they had to veer north across Lake Superior to stay out of the worst of it.

A bumpy ride awaits those who dare enter

But along the journey of their equipment reposition flight, Frans documented rapid development of the cumulonimbus clouds, as heat from below raced skyward into the much cooler atmosphere, exploding into convection along the way. The flat tops of the storms in the distance are informally known as anvil tops due to their obvious resemblance to anvils.

HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER ON TV

Anvils are caused when the rising air hits a stable layer of the atmosphere where the temperature profile prevents the clouds from rising further, instead acting like an invisible wall where the clouds will then spread out along the boundary layer. They're signs of a mature thunderstorm and something you want to avoid flying through as a pilot.

""We would have probably encountered at least moderate turbulence and likely worse,"" Frans said. ""Generally the tops of clouds – especially cumulus – dump a TON of ice into the airframe as you fly through, so the windshield (where it's not heated) would instantly be covered in ice.""

What's more, with temperatures below freezing and strong updrafts in the clouds, the precipitation you'd be flying through is not rain, but hail.

LIGHTNING STRIKES ON AIRPLANES CAN BE SCARY - JUST ASK MILEY CYRUS

""So it would be very loud with 1/4-inch ice balls slamming into the windscreen at 400 mph,"" Frans said. ""And of course the planes are designed to take most of that but if it's severe that's beyond what it's designed for. Also, it can be dangerous if people aren't seat-belted in.""

The Korea Herald reports that hundreds of people have lost their homes in the flooding, and hundreds more have been forced to evacuate and seek higher ground after rivers and streams overflowed their banks, pouring water onto local streets and highways in the city.

Videos posted to social media show incredible amounts of water covering roads across the city, leaving cars stranded and traffic backing up as water rose.

An emergency meeting was held Monday with South Korean Prime Minister Han Deok-soo to get more information on the unfolding situation and to mitigate other injuries and deaths as a result of the historic rainfall, according to a press release.

South Korean President Seok-Yeol Yoon said it was ""regrettable"" that human lives have been lost and instructed local governments and other organizations to continue emergency work systems to do what they can to prevent more loss of life, the press release said.

And because of the flooding in the Seoul area, access to low-lying areas like underpasses, riverbanks and other flood-prone regions will be restricted until further notice.

The Korea Meteorological Administration said on Facebook that heavy rain will continue in the central regions of the country, as well as the northern Gyeonbuk region, until at least Friday.

Rain should end in the Jeolla region and outside Gyeongsang areas on Wednesday, according to the Korea Meteorological Administration.

In addition, the Korea Meteorological Administration said the rain is very slow-moving, and rainfall rates between nearly 2 to 4 inches per hour are expected.

Data coming in from the recent torrential rain has been quite impressive as well.

Monday's rain was the highest total seen in the region since 1920 when 13.96 inches of rainfall was reported.

In addition, Seoul had rainfall rates of 1.23 inches per hour, while to the southwest in Incheon, the rainfall rate was reported at 3.28 inches per hour.

The Korea Herald reports that the Korea Meteorological Administration is warning people to prepare for additional damage and destruction from the additional rainfall and likely flooding in the Seoul area, and urges people to pay attention to local reports and follow guidance from local officials.

One of the hardest-hit areas of Seoul was Gangnam, which is the capital city's more affluent residential area, according to the Korea Herald.

Before Seoul became the bustling metropolis it is today, the region was a desolate, muddy flatland home to only a few scattered villages.

Today, the region has been developed, and nearly 10 million people call Seoul home. But its geography remains the same – low-lying and prone to flooding.

Flood tunnels and other flood mitigation projects have been constructed and are currently under development and construction, but the Korea Herald reports that fears are growing that they won't be able to withstand the amount of rain and flooding that the area saw on Monday as the system was designed to withstand rain and flooding events on a much smaller scale."

Local NAACP chapters, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, criminal defense lawyers and other civil rights advocacy groups endorsed automatic expungement, and it could broaden support for the initiative among Republican criminal justice advocates. Seven other states with legal recreational marijuana have also adopted automatic expungement policies.

Marijuana sales would be taxed at 6% under the Missouri measure. The tax is estimated to bring in more than $46 million during the first full year the amendment is in effect and close to $70 million the following year. Revenues would be earmarked for veterans’ homes, drug treatment programs and public defenders.

Cities and other municipalities could enact local sales taxes on recreational marijuana up to 3% or enact local bans on non-medical marijuana sales by a public vote.

Ashcroft said a separate proposal to allow ranked-choice voting failed to collect the roughly 170,000 voter signatures from six of the state’s eight congressional districts to get on the ballot.

Under that proposal, candidates from all parties would have been listed on primary ballots beginning in August 2024, meaning voters could pick from Republicans and Democrats without requesting a party-specific ballot. The top four candidates with the most votes would move on to the general election, when voters could either pick only their favorite or rank the candidates from first to last.

Better Elections spokesman Scott Charton said in a statement that proponents would honor supporters ""with continued work"" on the issue.

Mortgage rates dropped last week to their lowest level since April, offering some relief to prospective home buyers who have faced higher rates and soaring prices for real estate. According to data from Freddie Mac, the 30-year loan, the most popular among new homeowners, dipped back below the 5% mark.

The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 4.99% for the week ending August 4, which was down from the week before when it averaged 5.3%, according to the mortgage giant’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey. Last week’s figure was still significantly higher than the 2.77% figure the year before.

""When you have the factor of higher mortgage rates, meaning it’s probably harder to buy, people lean towards renting,"" Roschelle told host Stuart Varney.

""When the job market’s strong they are employed, so they can afford rent and inflation just raises the price of everything.""

On Friday it was revealed that U.S. job growth unexpectedly accelerated in July, defying fears of a slowdown in hiring even as the labor market confronts the twin threats of scorching-hot inflation and rising interest rates.

Employers added 528,000 jobs in July, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, blowing past the 250,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, edged down to 3.5%, the lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic began more than two years ago.

EVERY DAY THEY'RE HUSTLING! INFLATION PROMPTS INCREASE IN SIDE GIGS AMID ‘GOOD’ JOB MARKET, SAYS EXPERT



Meantime, the Labor Department revealed last month that inflation accelerated more than expected to a new four-decade high in June.

The department said the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 9.1% in June from a year ago. Prices jumped 1.3% in the one-month period from May. Those figures were both far higher than the 8.8% headline figure and 1% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists.

The data marked the fastest pace of inflation since December 1981.

Shelter costs – which account for roughly one-third of the CPI – sped up again in June, climbing 0.6%, matching an 18-year-high set in May. On an annual basis, shelter costs have climbed 5.6%, the fastest since February 1991.

Rent costs also surged in June, jumping 0.8% over the month, the largest monthly increase since April 1986. Rising rents are a concerning development because higher housing costs most directly and acutely affect household budgets.

July’s inflation data will be released on Wednesday.



POWELL SAYS THERE IS NO GUARANTEE FED CAN TAMP DOWN INFLATION WITHOUT HURTING THE JOB MARKET

Roschelle noted that if rent is more expensive, ""discretionary spending items go by the wayside and then people start taking second jobs just to do what? Feed themselves, food and shelter.""

""It’s crazy, but that’s exactly what happened during the ’70s,"" he continued.

Roschelle noted that he reviewed data from the 1970s and said that the dynamics are ""identical to what they are right now.""

""And what happened in the ’70s? Rents went through the roof, so it’s eerily reminiscent of the Carter days,"" he warned. Americans had experienced an inflation spike in the 1970s, which posed a big shock to the economy.

U.S. existing home sales dropped to a fresh two-year low in June as rising mortgage rates and the relentless increase in home values slowed activity by edging prospective homebuyers out of the market.



Sales of previously owned homes tumbled 5.4% in June from the previous month to an annual rate of 5.12 million units, the lowest level since June 2020, according to data released late last month by the National Association of Realtors. It marks the fifth consecutive month that sales have declined. On an annual basis, home sales plunged 14.2% in June.

The slowdown in sales came as the national median home price surged higher in June, hitting a new record of $416,000. That's up 13.4% from the previous year and is an increase from a revised $408,400 in May.

The interest rate sensitive housing market has started to cool noticeably in recent months as the Federal Reserve moves to tighten policy at the fastest pace in three decades. Policymakers already approved a 75-basis point rate increase in both June and July.

Following the rate hikes, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to nearly 6% in June, though they've since moderated.

Pointing to existing and new home sales data, Roschelle noted that, overall, the housing market is ""slowing down dramatically,"" but stressed there ""is so much demand for housing that it’s not going to cause a crash.""

The association pointed to data by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Census Bureau, which revealed that sales of newly built, single-family homes in June fell 8.1% from May and that new home sales dropped 13.4% in 2022 year-to-date.

NAHB Chairman Jerry Konter, who is a home builder and developer from Savannah, Ga., noted that, ""builders saw sales decline significantly as buyers were priced out of the market on higher interest rates,"" also attributing the decline to the ongoing home building and development costs, including building materials.

NAHB’s assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis, Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, pointed out that ""deteriorating affordability conditions and growing sticker shock"" are contributing to the latest trends, as ""only 14% of new home sales in June were priced below $300,000"" compared to 27% the same time last year.

The median sales price of a new single-family home dipped to $402,400 in June, down 9.5% compared to May, but is up 7.4% compared to the same time last year, the NAHB reported.

""Right now I would say that for new homes it is very, very tough to sell it and make a profit on it - and so they are not going to build it if they can’t,"" Howard told Varney Wednesday.



HOUSING STARTS IN JUNE PLUNGE TO LOWEST LEVEL IN 9 MONTHS

Last month it was revealed that builder confidence plunged in July amid soaring inflation and increased interest rates, which stalled the housing market by dramatically slowing sales and traffic from prospective buyers.

Home builder confidence in the market for newly-built single-family homes dropped 12 points lower to 55 in July, its seventh consecutive monthly decline, according to the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) released last month.

The index can range between 0 and 100 with any print over 50 indicating positive sentiment. Any reading above 80 signals strong demand.

The data marked the lowest HMI reading since May 2020 and the largest single-month drop in the history of the index, with the exception of the 42-point drop in April 2020, the association noted.

Speaking on ""Varney & Co."" last month following the release of builder confidence data, Howard stressed that there is no doubt that it provides a clear sign that the housing market is slowing.

On Wednesday, FOX Business’ Madison Alworth reported that realtors noted a slowdown in the market.

Realtor Linda Okupski of Keller Williams Real Estate in New Jersey explained how the market has changed over the past few months, noting that certain factors that didn’t make a difference last year, matter a lot more now.

Okupski said she ""could sell a cardboard box under a bridge last year and have a markup of an incredible amount of money,"" but ""now the condition of the house matters, the pricing of the house matters and how you market the house.""

Real estate company Redfin noted in a news release last month that homebuyers are getting some relief as sellers slash their prices at a record rate.

Redfin also said that the portion of homes going for above list price fell for the first time since June 2020 as sellers reacted to slowing demand from homebuyers amid the economic landscape.

Ratiu calculated the mortgage payments for a median-priced home on Realtor.com in June. For a home listed at around $450,000, with a 20% down payment and 30-year fixed mortgage rate, the mortgage rate came to about $2,100, which is a nearly 60% year-over-year jump, according to Ratiu.

Some homebuyers had to drop out of the buying market completely and face the rental market, while others are still in the game but ""are a lot less willing to bid over asking price or entertain homes that are overpriced,"" Fairweather added.

Since buyers are ""more jittery,"" sellers are making concessions and dropping prices. Fairweather said sellers no longer have the luxury of choosing between dozens of offers like they would have had earlier this year.

Boise, Idaho, had the biggest share of buyers, 61.5%, that dropped their asking prices, according to the analysis. That's up from 25.7% in June 2021.

However, their popularity worked against them.

For instance, the typical home in Boise sold for $550,000 in May, 60% higher than two years ago, according to the report. Similarly, prices for the typical home in Sacramento increased 44% to $610,000.

""Consumer sentiment is also making home buyers more reluctant to stretch their budgets,"" Fairweather added.

Not only are homebuyers worried about inflation continuing to rise, but they are also concerned about what would happen if the economy falls into a recession and unemployment rates increase, according to Fairweather.

Campins also noted that rising interest rates have caused a slowdown in real estate market.

The interest rate-sensitive housing market has started to cool noticeably in recent months as the Federal Reserve moves to tighten policy at the fastest pace in three decades. Policymakers already approved a 75-basis point rate increase in June and are expected to approve another of that magnitude at the end of July.

Following the rate hikes, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage – the most popular among new homeowners – climbed to nearly 6% in June, though they've since moderated. The average rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage hovered around 5.51% for the week ending July 14, according to recent data from mortgage lender Freddie Mac.

The real estate expert provided the insight on the same day it was revealed that U.S. existing home sales dropped to a fresh two-year low in June as rising mortgage rates and the relentless increase in home values slowed activity by edging prospective homebuyers out of the market.

REAL ESTATE MOGUL RIPS ‘NO CONCERTED POLITICAL FOCUS’ TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

Sales of previously owned homes tumbled 5.4% in June from the previous month to an annual rate of 5.12 million units, the lowest level since June 2020, according to new data released by the National Association of Realtors. It marks the fifth consecutive month that sales have declined. On an annual basis, home sales plunged 14.2% in June.

The slowdown in sales came as the national median home price surged higher in June, hitting a new record of $416,000. That's up 13.4% from the previous year and is an increase from a revised $408,400 in May.

Campins noted that there is still is ""very low supply.""

She added that ""some buyers have regressed out of the market and sellers are waiting for them to come back in"" due to the current market conditions.

""What we’re beginning to see is even with the rise in interest rates, some people are now turning to an ARM or an adjustable-rate mortgage, which is very different than what we’ve seen in recent years,"" she explained. ""That is basically you get an ARM for five to seven years. The rate doesn’t change during that time and then it will adjust after that.""

""The reason for that, the old saying is, ‘You marry the house and date the rate,’ so if you still find a house in this market that you love, you can always refinance later on,"" she continued.

There were about 1.26 million homes for sale at the end of June, according to the report released Wednesday, an increase of 2.4% from one year ago. It is the first annual gain in three years. At the current pace of sales, it would take roughly three months to exhaust the inventory of existing homes – up from 2.6 months one year ago. Experts view a pace of six to seven months as a healthy level.

Campins added that ""some markets are doing better than others"" and ""we are beginning to see more inventory, which is a good thing for buyers because we had such a low amount of supply in the market.""

""There has been a lack of concerted governmental effort across all Western Europe, Western economies, for decades to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of affordable housing,"" Cain International CEO Jonathan Goldstein said on ""Mornings with Maria"" Wednesday.

""What they've done is they put blockages and regulatory and red tape problems in front of developers, and there is no concerted political focus on this as a problem, and be that from the right or be that from the left, the same problem,"" he continued.

Home builder confidence in the market for newly-built single-family homes dropped 12 points lower to 55 in July, its seventh consecutive monthly decline according to the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) released on Monday.

The index can range between 0 and 100 with any print over 50 indicating positive sentiment. Any reading above 80 signals strong demand.

HOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE MISSED THE MARK ON SURGING INFLATION

The data released Monday marks the lowest HMI reading since May 2020 and the largest single-month drop in the history of the index, with the exception of the 42-point drop in April 2020, the association noted.

Speaking on ""Varney & Co."" on Monday, Howard stressed that there is no doubt that the data provides a clear sign that the housing market is slowing.

""For the last seven straight months it has been going down and this is a huge drop - and I think all it says is, ‘Somebody do something or we’re going to go into a recession,’"" Howard said.

He then argued that the ""only way to bring down housing costs is to bring down the cost of building materials, fix the supply chain, negotiate a lumber deal with Canada, [and] deregulate some of the regulations that are unnecessary.""

""We hope that policymakers will take this as sort of a last cry for help,"" he added.

The Federal Reserve has been hiking rates in an effort to tame inflation, which now sits at a fresh 40-year high, and the moves have been impacting the housing market in the form of higher mortgage rates.

Though mortgage rates do not follow the federal funds rate, they do typically follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury.

NAHB Chairman Jerry Konter, who is a home builder and developer from Georgia, noted in a news release that ""production bottlenecks, rising home building costs and high inflation are causing many builders to halt construction because the cost of land, construction and financing exceeds the market value of the home.""

""In another sign of a softening market, 13% of builders in the HMI survey reported reducing home prices in the past month to bolster sales and/or limit cancellations,"" he continued.

Howard noted on Monday that ""we’re starting to see slowdowns"" as it pertains to demand.

PENDING HOME SALES UNEXPECTEDLY BREAK SIX-MONTH LOSING STREAK IN MAY

Even though lease signings rose from May, they dropped nearly 50% since June 2021.

The issue is that mortgage rates, which are ""surging after the pivot in the Fed policy this spring,"" are pushing more consumers out of the homebuying market, Miller Samuel CEO Jonathan Miller told FOX Business.

Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the 30-year rate rose to 5.51% from 5.30% last week. One year ago the average 30-year rate was 2.88%.

Ron DeSantis and Republican state lawmakers recently took a major step toward fighting back against woke corporations parroting Biden’s leftist agenda.

According to a press release by DeSantis’ office, his proposed legislation, will target environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. It’s a move that will, if successful, go a long way toward protecting individual liberty and promoting free-market economics. His bill, which will be introduced formally during the 2023 legislative session, would ""Prohibit big banks, credit card companies and money transmitters from discriminating against customers for their religious, political, or social beliefs.""

It would also ""Prohibit State Board of Administration (SBA) fund managers from considering ESG factors when investing the state’s money"" and mandate that SBA fund managers ""only consider maximizing the return on investment on behalf of Florida’s retirees.""

DESANTIS SPIKES FOOTBALL AFTER MAJOR EMPLOYER DITCHES CHICAGO FOR FLORIDA

In Florida, the SBA is responsible for managing and investing the assets of the state’s retirement system and other funds.

ESG scores are a kind of social credit scoring system that is now widely being used by woke corporations and Wall Street investors to promote the Biden administration’s far-left agenda, all without having to pass a law through Congress or a state legislature.

ESG scores turn market economics on its head, by rewarding companies based on non-financial, non-business metrics that have absolutely nothing to do with supply and demand. For example, one highly influential ESG system promoted by the World Economic Forum rates companies based on their ""Percentage of employees per employee category, by age group, gender and other indicators of diversity (e.g. ethnicity).""

In other words, under many ESG models, a company with the ""wrong"" ratio of Asian to Hispanic workers would receive a lower ESG social credit score than a business that might sell goods and services that are of a lower quality, but that has a ratio of certain racial groups that’s deemed desirable by corporate elites.

Similarly, ESG metrics punish companies that use too much water or land, aren’t committed to adopting various parts of the Biden administration’s climate change agenda, and don’t engage in community activism.

Many of America’s largest banks, including companies like Bank of America, investment managers like BlackRock, and big-tech companies such as Microsoft have pledged to use ESG scores to help transform society so that it's in line with numerous left-wing goals, especially those related to climate change.

In fact, every one of America’s six largest banks — Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo — have committed to using ESG and their financial might to force the U.S. economy to produce net-zero carbon dioxide emissions, a decision that is having an absolutely disastrous effect on investment in fossil-fuel development at a time when gas prices are near their all-time highs.

ESG scores have also been used to deny access to capital or payment services for gun manufacturers and other legal businesses hated by left-wing elites.

ESG has been used to discriminate against those who hold social and political views corporate leaders don’t like. For example, the conservative group Moms for Liberty claims payment processor PayPal froze its assets because of the organization’s ideological views.

DeSantis’s proposed legislation, which was rolled out in partnership with Florida’s incoming speaker of the House, Rep. Paul Renner, would put pressure on investment management firms to avoid ESG by preventing many of Florida’s public investments from being used to promote ESG. It would also prohibit banks from using ESG metrics to discriminate against customers on the basis of their religious, political or social beliefs.

The detailed legislative language included in DeSantis’s proposal has yet to be released publicly, and, unfortunately, it appears DeSantis’s legislation would not stop the use of all forms of ESG discrimination. For example, it appears under his proposal, banks could deny access to banking services to customers who refuse to buy electric cars or choose not to put solar panels on the roofs of their home or business.

Despite these flaws, however, the proposal offered by DeSantis and Republicans in Florida’s state legislature are a huge step in the right direction.

Banks, financial institutions, and investment managers should not be allowed to use their economic power to make an end run around the Constitution and democratic institutions by discriminating against businesses and individuals based on non-financial considerations.

Hopefully, lawmakers in other states will soon take notice of the tremendous progress being made to stop these practices in Florida and make similar, perhaps even stronger efforts to stop the rise of ESG."

Really.

MANCHIN-SCHUMER SPENDING BILL COULD ELIMINATE 30,000 JOBS, NEW ANALYSIS SHOWS

By raising taxes in a recession, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-WV, is breaking his word to West Virginians. In 2010 when he asked voters to send him to the Senate, Manchin said: ""I don’t think during a time of recession you mess with any of the taxes or increase any taxes.""

Manchin announced his surprise tax-hike deal just as news confirmed the U.S. had its second consecutive quarter of negative GDP growth.

Even Barack Obama knows it is a bad idea to raise taxes in a recession. Obama said: ""The last thing you want to do is to raise taxes in the middle of a recession.""

The Democrat tax-and-spending bill is good for some: the Internal Revenue Service. Democrats plan to shovel $80 billion to the IRS to hire 87,000 more IRS agents. What will they do? The IRS has already announced a goal to increase small business audits by 50%.

Small businesses are barely keeping the lights on, battered by government-forced shutdowns and higher costs. Now the Democrats want to bury them in IRS paperwork and fishing-expedition audits that can easily last two to three years.

Small business owners are busy. They can’t afford teams of lawyers and accountants, and many will just give up even if they did nothing wrong, just to get the IRS off their backs.

Meanwhile, the IRS only answers the phone ""19 or 20 percent"" of the time. The Democrats plan to spend 14 times as much money for ""enforcement"" (audits) than for ""taxpayer services"" (answering the phone).

But wait. There is more. The IRS will spend more of your money to buy new cars for themselves, despite the fact that the inspector general found the IRS vehicle fleet is already too large, and the agency fails to ensure they are used only for official business. The watchdog report found ""questionable and missing information reported by special agents for commutes and commuting miles.""

In other words, the IRS would fail one of its own audits. The IRS puts the screws to small business owners if they cannot properly document vehicle mileage. Meanwhile, the IRS’s own books are a disaster because they know there are no consequences.

Democrats like to pretend the IRS is broke, but the agency’s actual spending behavior proves otherwise.

The bill also gives the IRS an extra pot of money for new offices even though the agency chief admits that 53% of IRS employees never bother to come into the office. They ""work"" at home. The IRS should be downsizing its physical office presence, not increasing it.

Why all this money for the IRS which regularly fails to manage itself competently?

The IRS union gives 100% of its PAC contributions to Democrats.

More IRS agents means more dues and more employee political contributions which find their way back to Democrat campaign accounts. Coincidence?

Democrats have named this tax and spending blowout the ""Inflation Reduction Act of 2022."" They know Americans are angry about the inflation they see every day at the grocery store and the gas station. So rather than stop the overspending that created inflation, they will spend more, tax more, and relabel the bill ""anti-inflation.""

They think the problem is one of communication rather than the reality of President Joe Biden repeating all the failures of President Jimmy Carter with all the same unpleasant results.

This tax-and-spending bill is best understood as pork-barrel spending larded up with earmarked goodies for special interests.

Many of the failed ideas in this legislation date back to the ""Great Society"" welfare spending. The bill also imposes price controls on U.S. drug manufacturers enforced by a 95% federal excise tax. Wage-and-price controls have created shortages and higher prices for 3,000 years of recorded history.

The inflation and recession we now suffer under were created by the Democrats and the Biden administration through their $2 trillion spending spree and the threats of new taxes and regulations.

Now the Democrats offer more of the same as the solution to the problem they created. This will not end well.

But the worst thing about this bill is the crushing effect it will have on American manufacturing.

The tax portion of Democrats’ imaginatively named ""Inflation Reduction Act"" hinges on something called the book-income minimum tax.

Basically, this means corporations would pay a 15 percent minimum tax on the income they report to their shareholders.

MANCHIN-SCHUMER SPENDING BILL COULD ELIMINATE 30,000 JOBS, NEW ANALYSIS SHOWS

According to Congress’s non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation, American manufacturers would take the hit for 49.7 percent of this tax.

That means half of the $313 billion this plan is expected to redistribute will come from U.S. manufacturing industry we’re already struggling to keep here in the U.S.

They should have called it the Manufacturing Reduction Act.

Manufacturing is already hurting from the Biden recession. In a new report out this week from the Institute for Supply Management, U.S. manufacturing expansion has cooled to its slowest pace since the locked-down summer of 2020.

It’s no mystery why U.S. manufacturing is slowing: Americans are cutting back due to Biden’s 9.1 percent inflation pay cut, and supply is stacking up.

And we know who will end up taking the hit from this harebrained scheme: American manufacturing workers and American consumers.

But it’s not just the larger manufacturers that will take a hit from this bill.

Small manufacturers often rely upon large manufacturers as their primary customers. For example, over half of Americans who work in machine shops or screw, nut, and bolt manufacturers work in firms with less than 50 employees.

When you hike taxes for large manufacturers, they buy less from small manufacturers. The negative effects of this tax hike will be felt in small communities across the country.

This bill also includes $80 billion to double the size of the IRS and hire 80,000 new agents to shake America’s couch cushions for every last cent to blow on failed social programs.

The IRS already announced last year it would be increasing the number of small businesses it audits by 50 percent, and that’s before this proposed $80 billion boost to their operating budget.

Large corporations retain teams of lawyers to deal with IRS audits. Small businesses don’t, and this extra hassle adds one more insult to the injury of 9.1 percent inflation.

What's more, the unemployment rate is usually a lagging indicator of recessions.","The Commerce Department confirmed Thursday what ordinary Americans and small business owners already know by indicating the economy is in a recession.

On Thursday, the Commerce Department estimated GDP fell by 0.9% in the second quarter after falling by 1.6% in the first quarter, meaning the economy has contracted for two consecutive quarters, meeting the traditional definition of a recession long used by economists.

Don't expect this memo to reach the White House, which has been busy trying to prebut Thursday's GDP release by claiming this longstanding recession definition is inaccurate, and the economy is not in recession.

BIDEN SAYS 'NO SURPRISE' ECONOMY 'SLOWING DOWN' AS ECONOMY ENTERS TECHNICAL RECESSION

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen claimed on ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that ""even if that [second quarter GDP] number is negative, we are not in a recession now. I would warn that we should be not characterizing that as a recession."" National Economic Council Director Brian Deese echoed her comments at a press briefing on Tuesday.

This administration's gaslighting ignores that the two-quarter benchmark is widely accepted, and that, according to University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith, ""There has never been an occasion in which GDP contracted for two consecutive quarters and a recession was not eventually declared.""

Team Biden's recession revisionism is channeling Groucho Marx, who said, ""Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?"" It is a desperate and shameful attempt to move the recession goalposts to prevent Biden from being labeled a recession President. This distinction will further hurt Democrats' chances in the midterm elections this fall.

Yet even following the White House's request to take ""a holistic look at the data"" still indicates the economy is in recession. The fastest inflation in 41 years has led to falling real wages and living standards. Sky-high gas prices are causing immense pain at the pump. And financial markets had their worst start of the year since 1970.

US ECONOMY ENTERS TECHNICAL RECESSION AFTER GROWTH TUMBLES 0.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER

Middle-class Americans are being squeezed from both sides as their cost of living increases and their savings decrease. No wonder consumer and small business confidence are at record lows. No matter how the administration tries to slice it, the economy is in recession.

The Biden administration continues to point to the nation's supposedly strong labor market to back up its claims. On Sunday, Sec. Yellen said she'd be ""amazed"" if the U.S. were in a recession because ""we've got a very strong labor market.""

The topline unemployment rate of 3.6% indeed seems low. But it is being driven by a declining labor force participation rate, which is still far below its pre-pandemic level and has fallen in recent months.

Rather than playing semantic games, the Biden administration should spend its time working on getting the country out of this recession of its own making. That means opposing the tax-and-spend reconciliation bill agreed to on Wednesday by Senate Democrats. This bill would increase spending by $400 billion and raise taxes by $700 billion, fueling inflation and killing jobs at the worst possible time, prolonging the recession.

Yet as the saying goes, the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem. Team Biden's first step to getting the economy back on track is admitting today's recession reality.

Younger professionals, in particular, also had a ""heightened expectation"" to have more paid time off, schedule flexibility and meaningful work and were willing to make a change to attain this, according to Kelly Lannan, senior vice president for emerging customers at Fidelty Investments.

In May, a survey from Fidelity revealed that approximately 61% of young professionals between the ages of 25-35 years old changed jobs in the last two years or plan to do so within the following two years.

A record number of American workers – 4.5 million – quit their jobs in November 2021, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It's a significant uptick from November 2020, when 3.2 million people quit. It didn't stop there. BLS data shows another record 4.5 million Americans quit in March 2022.

""Ultimately, employees moving to new roles and new organizations are really looking for what makes them happy, and often the sentiment is that more money equals a happier life,"" he said. ""For instance, sign-on bonuses seem great, but is it being offered because the organization's culture isn't one that cultivates value and fulfillment in its employees?""

Carden stressed that it's vital for employees to do their due diligence and to look into the offer and company before taking the job.

Still, ""to help retain employees, businesses have the responsibility to cultivate an environment of clarity, alignment and purpose that connects employees to business goals and objectives where they feel valued and trusted,"" he added.

IS THE UNITED STATES ENTERING A RECESSION?

Morgan agreed, saying that it is in the employer's benefit to focus on the wellness of their staff and ensure that workers are satisfied with the culture of the workplace.

""Organizations that are navigating the impacts of inflation and constricting budgets are facing tough business decisions, but it does cost much less money and is better for company morale overall to reskill and redeploy existing talent rather than overhauling workforces entirely,"" he added.

That said, Morgan argued that Great Resignation has shifted how companies prepare for a possible recession. Rather than instituting massive layoffs, ""organizations are doing what they can to hold onto their talent even through a recession because they’ve seen how scarce talent is and that turnover is more costly in the long run,"" he said.

Still, he recognized that there is a ""high likelihood"" that job cuts will likely accelerate in the second half of the year. Some companies have already started laying off employees.

The chief executives of Alphabet and Meta warned employees that they need to step up their productivity amid the uncertain economic environment, prompting fears of potential layoffs. Meanwhile, Walmart, Oracle and Robinhood have already started trimming their workforces."

Oil prices slipped on Tuesday as traders eyed the latest progress in last-ditch talks to revive the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, which would clear the way to boost its crude exports in a tight market.

Brent crude futures were down 86 cents, or 0.9%, at $95.79 a barrel at 0725 GMT, after gaining 1.8% in the previous session.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures declined 88 cents, or 1%, to $89.88 a barrel, after climbing 2% in the previous session.

However, signs that demand may not be dented by weakening global growth as much as feared are keeping a floor under the market for now, following stronger-than-expected trade data from China on the weekend and the surprising acceleration in U.S. jobs growth in July.

The oil market has remained under pressure recently over global recession fears, with Brent prices suffering their biggest weekly drop since April 2020 last week.

China, the world's largest crude oil importer, brought in 8.79 million barrels per day of crude in July, 9.5% less than a year earlier but up from June's volumes, according to China's customs data.

""This all hits middle-income Americans,"" Norquist stressed. ""The president knows that; he lied.""

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT: WHAT TAX HIKES ARE IN THE BILL?

""He signed anyway So did Senator Sinema from Arizona; she knew better than this and still signed on,"" he continued.

Norquist stressed that, while President Biden repeatedly promised during his presidency and campaign not to raise taxes on any American earning less than $400,000 a year, the Democrats' spending and tax bill will raise taxes for everyone.

After months of painstaking negotiations, Senate Democrats on Sunday approved the sweeping health care and climate change spending package that amounts to one of the largest tax hikes in decades.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 – which passed along party lines with Democrats employing the budget reconciliation process – would raise an estimated $739 billion over the next decade, with the revenues going toward initiatives designed to combat climate change and curb pharmaceutical prices, as well as efforts to reduce the nation's $30 trillion debt.

It includes about $433 billion in new spending, while roughly $300 billion of the new revenue raised would go toward paying down the nation's deficit. Democrats say the legislation will help to reduce inflation and provide relief to Americans in the form of lower health care costs, while Republicans argue the measure does little to tackle higher prices – and could actually exacerbate the crisis.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in an analysis last week that the spending bill will have a negligible impact on inflation.



US ECONOMY ENTERS TECHNICAL RECESSION AFTER GROWTH TUMBLES 0.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER

The bill, which now heads to the House for a vote that could happen as soon as Friday, is a far cry from the ambitious $2 trillion agenda that President Biden rolled out last year that relied on major tax increases on wealthy Americans and corporations.



""This bill is far from perfect. It's a compromise. But it's often how progress is made,"" Biden said at the White House last week. ""My message to Congress is this: This is the strongest bill you can pass.""

""The president should be concerned because Congress made a liar out of him,"" Norquist said on Tuesday. ""His biggest promise was that he would never would raise taxes on anyone who earned less than $400,000 a year.""

He then noted that tax increase listed in the bill on the production of natural gas, crude oil and coal impacts all Americans.

""These hit everyone directly,"" he stressed. ""They raise the cost of energy [and] they make people poorer.""

Norquist then pointed to the fact that, under the legislation, the Internal Revenue Service would receive $80 billion in order to enhance tax enforcement by hiring more agents and introducing new technology to pursue tax dodgers.

Democrats expect a beefed-up IRS to add an extra $124 billion in revenue by cracking down on tax evasion by wealthy individuals and corporations.



HOW DEMOCRATS' BEEFED-UP IRS COULD HURT LOW-INCOME AMERICANS

According to an analysis released by House Republicans, Americans who earn less than $75,000 per year are slated to receive 60% of the additional tax audits expected under Democrats' spending package.

The analysis, which is a conservative estimate based upon recent audit rates and tax filing data, shows that individuals with an annual income of $75,000 or less would be subject to 710,863 additional Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits while those making more than $1 million would receive 52,295 more audits under the bill. The Inflation Reduction Act would roughly double the IRS' budget to increase enforcement and, therefore, federal tax revenue.

""There is not more money from big companies or from rich people; they have been fully audited for years. They’re [the IRS] going after - if you read their literature, middle-income - self-employed people."" Norquist argued. ""That's their target.""

He then pointed to the measure’s 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases that is poised to take effect in 2023. Democrats – who estimated this new levy will raise about $74 billion over the next decade – are hoping to slow companies' tendency to buy back their own stock from investors.

Norquist argued that ""if a company buys back its stock - which increases the value of stock for people with an IRA, or 401(k), or if you are a government employee and your pension is backed by stocks held for you by your city or state - you are going to see the value of your life savings go down.""

He stressed that ""half the country"" invests in the stock market through IRA or 401(k) accounts.

""Half the country has already been damaged by the president’s damage to the stock market, the value of people’s life savings,"" Norquist argued.

""If you’re saving your money in cash, he’s inflated it down to where it is worth less than it used to be; if you got into the stock market, it’s worth less than when he walked into office.""

He then stressed that ""this new tax will make it even worse for people who have 401(k)s, IRAs, who own shares of stock directly and to fund contribution pensions.""

Following the rate hikes, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage – the most popular among new homeowners – climbed to nearly 6% in June, though they've since moderated. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage hovered around 4.99% for the week ending Aug. 4, according to recent data from mortgage lender Freddie Mac.

After former President Trump 's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida was raided by FBI agents, Republicans are slamming the Biden administration and accusing the Department of Justice of ""political weaponization,"" while Democrats are lauding the agency for holding Trump accountable for ""wrongdoing.""

""The raid of MAL is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves,"" said Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. ""Now the Regime is getting another 87k IRS agents to wield against its adversaries? Banana Republic.""

Multiple sources tell Fox News the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago is related to the materials Trump allegedly brought to his private residence after his presidency concluded. That matter was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy issued a warning to Attorney General Merrick Garland that extensive oversight by Republicans in Congress will be heading his way.

However, ""Squad"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said the FBI is working toward ""accountability"" and went as far as to say Trump should be in prison.

""That’s what happens when you break the law, try to steal an election, and incite a deadly insurrection. Donald Trump should be in jail. I’m glad to see the FBI taking steps towards accountability.""

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., called Trump's statement ""defensive"" during an MSNBC segment Monday.

""But look, the FBI doesn't just go in unless a judge signs off on a search warrant. That means they have some probable evidence about possible wrongdoing.

""If the FBI can raid the home of a former US President, imagine what 87,000 more IRS agents will do to you,"" he quipped on Twitter.

On Monday, Aug. 8, 2022, former President Donald J. Trump's home in Florida, Mar-a-Lago, was raided by the FBI.

As reaction continues to come in about this event — What is Mar-a-Lago? Where is it, exactly? How big is it, and how long has he owned it?

Here is some detail and background.

In Donald J. Trump's 2004 book, ""Trump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life,"" he wrote, in part, ""Mar-a-Lago was sitting there a long time before I saw it and decided to move on that magnificent site.""

""I had the right vision for it,"" added Trump, ""and the timing was right for me — and ultimately, for the seller as well.""

Here's more.

When did Trump buy Mar-a-Lago?

Trump bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985 for approximately $10 million, according to publicly available information.

Where is Mar-a-Lago, exactly?

It's located in Palm Beach, Florida. Mar-a-Lago is a resort and national historic landmark.

When was it first built?

It was built between 1924 and 1927.

What is the history of Mar-a-Lago?

""The Mar-a-Lago Estate was opened officially in January 1927 after four years of construction,"" notes the website of Mar-a-Lago itself.

""Marjorie Merriweather Post (then Mrs. E.F. Hutton) searched for several years to find a proper location between the ocean and Lake Worth. The quest for a new home had begun when it became apparent that she was to be the dowager queen of Palm Beach,"" the site also explains.

""The site on which Mar-a-Lago sits is now considered the most valuable parcel of land anywhere in Florida.""

""At the time, there was little else here but undergrowth and swampy grounds, seemingly of not much use for a building site,"" the website notes.

""With her realtor, Post crawled through underbrush of jungle-type growth in search of the perfect piece of property; the consequence of that search is the main house ‘Mar-a-Lago,’ which is Spanish for ‘Sea to Lake.’""

Is Mar-a-Lago hurricane-resistant?

The structure is indeed ""hurricane resistant,"" the website of the mansion states.

How many acres does Mar-a-Lago have?

""The whole of the property comprises approximately 20 acres of perfectly landscaped lawns,"" according to the Mar-a-Lago website.

How valuable is Mar-a-Lago?

""The site on which Mar-a-Lago sits is now considered the most valuable parcel of land anywhere in Florida,"" says the property's website.

When did Mar-a-Lago become a National Historic Site?

""In January 1969, the Department of the Interior designated the estate as ‘the Mar-a-Lago National Historic Site,'"" says the website.

The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 by an Act of Congress.

Later, after Post passed away, ""the estate was willed to the federal government for use as a diplomatic/presidential retreat. Ten years later, due to maintenance and security concerns, the government conferred title to the Post Foundation.""

What other details are known about Trump's purchase of it?

""In 1985, Donald J. Trump purchased the property from the Post Foundation and used the estate as a private residence until 1995.""

Then, in April 1995, ""Mar-a-Lago became established as the Mar-a-Lago Club. It is the last remaining Palm Beach estate still containing its buildings and land in almost identical form as its original conception,"" the website makes clear.

""With the granting of easements to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Mar-a-Lago Club carries with it a built-in constituency that ensures its stewardship into the future.""

What else is there to know about Mar-a-Lago?

Trump keeps a section of the estate private for his family's personal use.

It is the second-largest mansion in the state of Florida.

What is Mar-a-Lago's value?

In 2018, Forbes valued the Mar-a-Lago estate at $160 million — or 16 times what Trump paid for it.

When did Mar-a-Lago become the main residence of Donald and Melania Trump?

In September 2019, Mar-a-Lago became the primary residence for Donald and Melania Trump.

They had previously maintained their primary residence in New York City.

What does membership at Mar-a-Lago include?

Membership includes ""the use of the formal and casual dining areas, the Mar-a-Lago Spa, the pool, the Beach Club, breathtaking guest rooms and exclusive suites, a state-of the-art-fitness center, award-winning tennis courts, beautiful croquet lawns and an entertainment series, which hosts internationally world-renowned talent,"" according to the property's website.

What is the cost of Mar-a-Lago membership?

Reported in multiple places is a figure of approximately $200,000 to join and costs of $14,000 per year, though this is not noted on the Mar-a-Lago website itself.

Scorching-hot inflation has forced the Federal Reserve to move at the most rapid pace in decades to raise interest rates to tame consumer demand, raising fears on Wall Street of a slowdown in growth or even a potential recession. Policymakers approved two consecutive 75-basis point rate hikes in June and July and have suggested that another increase of that magnitude is on the table in September.

Businesses also struggled to onboard new employees, with nearly half of owners (49%) reporting that they could not fill open jobs. The Labor Department reported last week that there were 10.7 million open jobs at the end of June.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 – which passed along party lines with Democrats employing the budget reconciliation process – would raise an estimated $739 billion over the next decade, with the revenues going toward initiatives designed to combat climate change and curb pharmaceutical prices, as well as efforts to reduce the nation's $30 trillion debt.

It includes about $433 billion in new spending, while roughly $300 billion of the new revenue raised would go toward paying down the nation's deficit. Democrats say the legislation will help to reduce inflation and provide relief to Americans in the form of lower health care costs, while Republicans argue the measure does little to tackle higher prices – and could actually exacerbate the crisis.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in an analysis last week that the spending bill will have a negligible impact on inflation.

JULY JOBS REPORT 'SCORCHER' RAISES ODDS OF ANOTHER SUPER-SIZED FED RATE HIKE

The bill, which now heads to the House for a vote that could happen as soon as Friday, is a far cry from the ambitious $2 trillion agenda that President Biden rolled out last year that relied on major tax increases on wealthy Americans and corporations.

""This bill is far from perfect. It's a compromise. But it's often how progress is made,"" Biden said at the White House last week. ""My message to Congress is this: This is the strongest bill you can pass.""

Here is a closer look at the tax increases and other items included in the latest legislation:

Corporate minimum tax: $313 billion

The legislation would impose a 15% minimum tax on corporations based on profits they publicly report on their financial statements to shareholders.

The levy would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income. Democrats said the levy would affect around 200 of the country's largest corporations – with profits exceeding $1 billion – that pay less than the current 21% rate for businesses.

The private equity industry secured a last-minute victory when several Democrats voted with Republicans to exempt private equity companies and businesses they own from the new corporate minimum tax.

Prescription drug pricing reforms: $288 billion

Under the bill, the Medicare program would have the power to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies in order to lower prices for certain prescription drugs. The proposal would cap what seniors on Medicare pay out of pocket for drugs each year at $2,000. Seniors would also be eligible for free vaccinations if the bill passes, according to a copy of the legislation.

Democrats projected this will save the government roughly $288 billion over the next 10 years.

If pharmaceutical companies raise the prices of their drugs more than the rate of inflation, pharmaceutical companies would be required to rebate Medicare.

US ECONOMY ENTERS TECHNICAL RECESSION AFTER GROWTH TUMBLES 0.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER

A provision to cap insulin prices at $35 a dose was thrown out by the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan referee, who ruled the limit could be applied to Medicare but not private insurance.

IRS enforcement: $124 billion

The Internal Revenue Service would receive $80 billion in order to enhance tax enforcement by hiring more agents and introducing new technology to pursue tax dodgers.

Democrats expect a beefed-up IRS to add an extra $124 billion in revenue by cracking down on tax evasion by wealthy individuals and corporations.

About $1 trillion in federal taxes may be going unpaid each year because of errors, fraud and a lack of resources to adequately enforce collections, IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said last year.

Audit rates have steadily declined over the last year, falling to the lowest level in at least four decades amid dwindling funding and enforcement staff (the IRS has 20,000 fewer staff than it did in 2010). The agency audited just 0.45% of personal income tax returns in 2019, down from 1.1% in 2010, Rettig said in January.

Stock buyback tax: $74 billion

The measure includes a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases that is poised to take effect in 2023. Democrats – who estimated this new levy will raise about $74 billion over the next decade – are hoping to slow companies' tendency to buy back their own stock from investors.

Democrats included the stock buyback tax to fill the revenue gap after Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., rejected a repeal of the break for carried interest.

""These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit scrutiny on small businesses or middle-income Americans,"" Rettig wrote in the letter. ""As we have been planning, our investment of these enforcement resources is designed around Treasury’s directive that audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for households making under $400,000.""

Providing the IRS with an influx of funding has been a top priority for President Biden and is one of the most prominent provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that Senate Democrats passed along party lines early Sunday.

DEMOCRATS' MINIMUM CORPORATE TAX WOULD HIT THESE INDUSTRIES THE HARDEST

The Democrats projected that enhancing IRS funding could add an extra $124 billion in federal revenue over the next decade by hiring more tax enforcers who can limit tax evasion by rich individuals and corporations. Roughly $1 trillion in federal taxes goes unpaid yearly because of errors, fraud and a lack of resources to adequately enforce collections, the IRS estimated last year.

But Republican lawmakers have sounded the alarm over the proposal, warning that it could have serious ramifications for lower-income workers.

That's because the IRS disproportionately targets low-income Americans when it conducts tax audits each year. In fact, households with less than $25,000 in earnings are five times as likely to be audited by the agency than everyone else, according to a recent analysis of tax data from fiscal year 2021 by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University.

The reason for that is a rise in what is known as ""correspondence audits,"" meaning the IRS conducts reviews of tax returns via letters or phone calls rather than more complex face-to-face audits. Just a fraction – 100,000 of the 659,000 audits in 2021 – were conducted in person.

According to the Syracuse study, more than half of the correspondence audits initiated by the IRS last year – 54% – involved low-income workers with gross receipts of less than $25,000 who claimed the earned income tax credit, an anti-poverty measure.

STRATEGISTS, TAX EXPERTS WEIGH IMPLICATIONS OF MANCHIN-BACKED BILL ON MIDTERM ELECTIONS

Even taxpayers with a total positive income that ranged from $200,000 to $1 million had one-third the odds of being audited by the IRS compared to the lowest-income wage earners. About 9 million taxpayers reported these high-income levels in 2021, but fewer than 40,000 of their returns were audited, or roughly 4.5 out of every 1,000. That contrasts sharply with lower-income Americans, who faced an audit rate of 13 out of every 1,000.

The discrepancy is primarily due to high-income taxpayers having complex investments that can easily shroud the gaps between taxes owed and paid vs. taxes reported and paid.

""Barring an unlikely significant change in the composition of IRS enforcement, the stepped-up IRS enforcement would subject taxpayers across the income spectrum to more scrutiny and greater audit risk,"" the conservative Heritage Foundation said in a recent blog post.

Still, Rettig argued that hiring more enforcement officers and modernizing the agency's antiquated technology could actually help the IRS to avoid auditing honest taxpayers.

""Large corporate and high-net-worth taxpayers often engage teams of sophisticated representatives pursuing unsettled or sometimes questionable interpretations of tax law,"" he said.

The EPA bureaucracy is another big winner, with vast new powers.
The healthcare bureaucracy is another big winner, with vast new powers.
You know who's not a big winner in this bill?","The Schumer-Manchin reconciliation bill, falsely titled the "" Inflation Reduction Act ,"" is really a pathetic piece of legislation. It is the ultimate big government socialism bill. It defines the Democratic Party as the radical left. There is no inflation reduction.

There are no incentives for growth or prosperity. It punishes successful people. It intensifies the war against fossil fuels. It adds to the war against the rest of business and industry. It increases the regulatory state that defines ""modern socialism"" and it furthers the Democratic campaign to end free-market capitalism.

There is not one good thing in this bill. The biggest winners are regulatory agencies like the EPA and the IRS, Medicare price controls and special interest rent-seeking corporate handouts. This bill has the potential to increase inflation and deepen recession. It will not reduce deficits or debt. This bill has no common sense. This bill is dumb — very, very dumb.

There's a thousand details that we don't yet know everything about and more will be revealed with our guests tonight, Senator Rob Portman and Ranking Republican Budget leader, Congressman Jason Smith. They'll be on in a moment.

AMID INFLATION, PEOPLE DESPERATE FOR CASH ARE TURNING TO PAWN SHOPS

My biggest concern is the big government socialism aspect of the huge growth in the federal government, and its regulatory octopus tentacles manipulated by left-wing bureaucrats, who in many cases can never be replaced without major governmental reforms.

The IRS is the best example, with an $80 billion budget increase and a doubling of its agents to go out there and chase down Uber drivers, the gig economy, small businesses, waitresses and pretty much anything that moves.

The basic Democratic assumption behind the massive IRS expansion is that successful people are cheating the system. They're all tax cheats. They're evil. They sit around conniving how to not pay taxes; like Elon Musk, who paid $11 billion in personal taxes last year, but presumably the new IRS will descend on him like locusts.

You see, Democrats have come to believe, as Obama said years ago, that ""you didn't build that"" on your own. That our economic system doesn't work without government management through taxing, regulating, spending, borrowing, money-printing. Entrepreneurs don't exist in the Democratic Party model and if they do, they're not paying their fair share and their success must be redistributed, Soviet-style. Let's make everybody equally poor, except of course the wealthy Democratic politicians who milk the system for all it's worth.

Know what the problem with the IRS tax cheat idea is? The tax system designed by Congress is impenetrable and indecipherable. Line up ten tax accountants and none of them will agree on crucial tax provisions. That's the problem. It's not tax cheats. It's terrible government tax policy.

A nice simplified low flat tax rate system would eliminate the need for 150,000 IRS agents and what's incredible on this topic is that, once again, the Congress in this session has significantly increased the number of tax credits, refundable credits, deductions, carve-outs, all sorts of political favors and corporate welfare, which will make the tax code immensely more complex and indecipherable.

In other words, ""there they go again"" and once this revenue grab fails, maybe the next Congress will ask for another 80,000 IRS agents.

FED COULD APPROVE 100-BASIS POINT INTEREST RATE HIKE AFTER JOBS SHOCKER, CITI SAYS

The whole IRS story epitomizes what is wrong with the DC swamp, and Congress, and the Executive Branch, and the massive regulatory state that is to be foisted on ordinary Americans.

The EPA bureaucracy is another big winner, with vast new powers. The healthcare bureaucracy is another big winner, with vast new powers.

You know who's not a big winner in this bill? Smart young men and women who come up with brilliant new ideas that turn into massive new advanced technologies, inventions or innovations. Their entrepreneurship will be punished — not rewarded — by taxes or rules and regulations or inflation .

The dopey dopes that spawned this stupid bill do not understand incentives to work, invest, create and take risks. Tax or regulate something and you get less of it.

The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.","The sweeping climate, health care and tax bill that Senate Democrats passed Sunday includes one of the biggest tax hikes in decades, including a new levy for corporations that repurchase their own stock.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which passed along party lines with Democrats employing the budget reconciliation process, would raise an estimated $739 billion over the next decade, with the revenues going toward initiatives designed to combat climate change and curb pharmaceutical prices, as well as efforts to reduce the nation's $30 trillion debt.

It includes about $433 billion in new spending, while roughly $300 billion of the new revenue raised would go toward paying down the nation's deficit.

Some of the main revenue raisers stem from new levies on wealthy businesses, including a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases that is poised to take effect in 2023. Democrats, who estimated this new levy will raise about $74 billion over the next decade, are hoping to slow companies' tendency to buy back their own stock from investors with the tax.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT: WHAT TAX HIKES ARE IN THE BILL?

Companies have been allowed to buy their own shares since 1982, and the practice has since become commonplace on Wall Street. In 2019, stock buybacks hit a record $1 trillion, according to the SEC. Buybacks already hit a record $281 billion in the first three months of 2022, according to S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt. Although they were down 17.4% in the second quarter.

""I hate stock buybacks,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""I think they are one of the most self-serving things that corporate America does.""

The bill also imposes a 15% minimum tax on corporations based on profits they publicly report on their financial statements to shareholders. The minimum book tax would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income. Democrats said the levy would affect around 200 of the country's largest corporations with profits exceeding $1 billion and that pay less than the current 21% rate for businesses.

Experts expect the two taxes to drag on 2023 earnings, with Goldman Sachs forecasting a 1.5% decline per share of S&P 500 companies. The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.

UBS strategists led by Solita Marcelli, meanwhile, projected the new taxes would have a ""very minimal 1% drag on S&P 500 earnings per share, although some companies will be more affected than others.""

He also noted that the inflationary pressures have led to soaring demand at food banks.

""We’re worried,"" Flood told ""Varney & Co."" on Tuesday.

""We rely mostly on donated food from farmers, retailers, manufacturers and then we supplement that with food purchases and so being a nonprofit, it’s a matter of what resources are coming in, in terms of the amount of food, the amount of funding to supplement that food, so it’s a concern right now as we look between now and the end of the year, especially because of inflation.""

FOOD BANKS ARE SERVING MORE PEOPLE AGAIN AS INFLATION SQUEEZES BUDGETS

""It’s really put a lot of pressure on families and household budgets and it’s leading a lot of people needing to seek food assistance,"" he stressed.

Flood provided the insight the day before July’s inflation data will be released.

Last month, the Labor Department revealed that inflation accelerated more than expected to a new four-decade high in June, exacerbating a financial strain for millions of Americans.

The department said the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 9.1% in June from a year ago. Prices jumped 1.3% in the one-month period from May. Those figures were both far higher than the 8.8% headline figure and 1% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists.

The data marked the fastest pace of inflation since December 1981.

Price increases were extensive with energy prices rising 7.5% in June from the previous month and 41.6% compared to the same time last year. Gasoline, on average, costs 59.9% more than it did one year ago and 11.2% more than it did in May. The food index, meanwhile, climbed 1% in June, as consumers paid more for items like cereal, chicken, milk, and fresh vegetables.

Shelter costs – which account for roughly one-third of the CPI – sped up again in June, climbing 0.6%, matching an 18-year-high set in May. On an annual basis, shelter costs have climbed 5.6%, the fastest since February 1991.

Rent costs also surged in June, jumping 0.8% over the month, the largest monthly increase since April 1986. Rising rents are a concerning development because higher housing costs most directly and acutely affect household budgets.

Flood pointed out the shift in the trend he has been noticing as it pertains to the demographic visiting food banks.

He noted that during the pandemic ""we had so many people who were furloughed or lost their jobs and didn’t have employment.""

""Now the employment picture has improved when you compare it to 2020 and 2021, so now we’re seeing a lot of people who are working, sometimes two jobs, in the family or household, sometimes more,"" Flood said.

He stressed that even so, ""the high prices of food, of fuel, and housing in a place like Los Angeles and other metro areas puts a lot of pressure on budgets.""

With inflation at 40-year highs, many Americans are looking for aid for the first time and food banks are struggling to meet demand.

Charitable food distribution has exceeded any amounts given out before the COVID-19 pandemic, although there was some relief last year.

Distribution by California's Alameda County Community Food Bank has risen this summer and Texas' Houston Food Bank now gives out an average of 610,000 pounds.

In Southern California, the Los Angeles bank gave away around 30 million pounds of food during the first three months of this year, far more than the 22 million pounds passed out during the first quarter of 2020.

A spokesperson said that was up from 500,000 daily pounds before the pandemic.

Freeport, the second-biggest U.S. LNG export plant, supplies BP with 4 million tonnes per year from a total portfolio of 18 million tonnes, BP Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss told Reuters.

""Freeport does create an impact in the quarter and we've provided for that for the year,"" Auchincloss said. The company had deducted the expected costs from its second-quarter profit, but Auchincloss did not specify costs.

A BP spokesperson declined to comment on the loss figure.

France's TotalEnergies also said it would replace eight cargoes of LNG it was scheduled to receive from Freeport by buying in the spot market in the third quarter of the year. It was unclear how much the replacement cargoes would cost TotalEnergies.

Freeport produces 15 million tonnes of LNG per year.

RUSSIA BANS INVESTORS FROM 'UNFRIENDLY COUNTRIES' FROM SELLING SHARES IN RUSSIAN ENERGY OR BANKING

Traders typically sign long-term offtake agreements with LNG producers and agree on separate deals to supply consumers with cargoes from their global portfolios. It's rare to use plant outages to justify not supplying consumers through what is known as force majeure.

Shell , the world's largest LNG trader with a 20% market share, cut its LNG production volumes in the second quarter by 4%, mainly due to supply losses from the Sakhalin-2 plant in Russia, where it exited operations after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February.

The company continues to receive LNG cargoes under existing long-term deals with Sakhalin-2, a company spokesperson said.

But the future of the contracts is shrouded in uncertainty after Russia gave foreign investors in the project one month to claim their stakes in a new entity that will replace the existing one. Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said it was ""highly unlikely"" Shell would join the new entity.

The supply loss impacted Shell's second-quarter profit by around $200 million in the quarter, according to estimates by industry sources. Shell declined to comment on the figure.

Nigeria's huge LNG export terminal on Bonny Island has also seen output declines in recent months as a result of a shortfall in natural gas supplies due to rampant theft and sabotage to oil and gas pipelines.

The money lost is dwarfed by enormous profits both BP and Shell recorded this year on the back of soaring refining margins and high oil and gas prices.

But lower availability of LNG has pushed benchmark prices to record highs as Europe sought to ramp up imports rapidly to replace lost Russian pipeline natural gas.

At current prices, an average cargo of LNG would cost around $100 million in the spot market.

European LNG imports from January to July surpassed a record 100 billion cubic metres (bcm), or 75 million tonnes (Mt), almost reaching the level observed through the entire 2021, according to Nnenna Amobi, senior LNG analyst at Refinitiv.

Around 35% of total European imports were received from the United States in July, versus 43% in June, mainly due to the loss of Freeport cargoes.

The global LNG market reached 380 million tonnes in 2021, according to Shell."

Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

As a parent, you have two main options to help pay for your child’s college expenses: Parent PLUS Loans and private student loans .

The federal government offers Parent PLUS Loans and they come with unique benefits. Private loans come from private lenders, and they may have lower interest rates if you have good credit.

In this article, we’ll go over the main differences between the two types of loans to help you figure out which may be right for you.



Credible lets you compare private student loan rates from multiple lenders, all in one place.

Parent PLUS Loans vs. private parent loans

Both Parent PLUS Loans and private parent loans give you the opportunity to borrow money for your child’s higher education expenses. But they differ significantly in how interest rates are set and how you’ll repay them.

Parent PLUS Loans

The U.S. Department of Education offers Parent PLUS Loans, which are more formally known as Direct PLUS Loans. Graduate or professional students can take these loans out, as well as parents of undergraduate students.

You generally apply for these loans online through the StudentAid.gov website . In most cases, you won’t qualify if you have an adverse credit history, like a bankruptcy or foreclosure in the last five years or a history of late or missed payments.

Parent PLUS Loans have a fixed interest rate set by the federal government, which is currently 7.54%. That means the interest rate won’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You’re able to borrow up to the full cost of attendance, as determined by your child’s school, minus any other financial aid the student receives. When you take out the loan, you’ll also pay a fee of 4.228% of the loan amount. To pay the fee, the government will deduct a portion of the funds from each loan payout.

Private parent loans

Private parent student loans have no standard requirements. Instead, individual lenders set their own qualifications, interest rates, and repayment terms. But in general, lenders determine the interest rate based on your credit score. People with higher credit scores will qualify for lower rates, while people with poor credit will get higher rates, if they qualify.

You may find private parent loans with fixed or variable rates. Variable-rate loans typically begin with a lower APR, but this rate can rise over time. Fixed-rate loans don’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You usually have the option to make full principal and interest payments while your child is in school, or you can make interest-only payments to keep the interest from building up. Most private parent loans must be repaid within 15 years, though loan terms may be shorter depending on the lender.

The best private parent loans feature zero loan fees. Just like with Parent PLUS Loans, you’re solely responsible for repaying a private parent loan.

Cosigned student loans

A third option for helping your child pay for their college education is by cosigning their student loan. When you do this, your child is the primary borrower on the loan but you’re agreeing to be responsible for repaying the loan if your child defaults.

You may consider cosigning a private student loan with your child. In many cases, students aren’t able to qualify for a loan on their own since they may have little or no credit history. By cosigning, lenders take your credit into account as well. Any missed payments will hurt both your credit and your child’s. Many lenders offer a cosigner release option, which allows you to remove yourself from the loan once your child has made a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments.

A cosigner usually isn’t required on federal student loans.

When does it make sense to take out a Parent PLUS Loan?

A Parent PLUS Loan may make the most sense if you have fair credit. With these federal loans, the interest rate is the same no matter your credit score. If you don’t have any major credit problems, but your score simply isn’t the best, you may get a lower rate on a Parent PLUS Loan than you would on a private loan.

A Parent PLUS Loan may also be the best choice if you want to take advantage of one of the unique repayment plans the government offers:

Standard Repayment Plan — This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years.

This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years. Extended Repayment Plan — This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan.

This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan. Graduated Repayment Plan — This plan can help if you expect to have a higher income in the future. Your payments start low, but rise over time. Ideally, your income would grow along with your payment. You also have up to 10 years to repay your loan under this plan.

If your payments are still too high, you may have the option to combine all the Parent PLUS Loans you have into a federal Direct Consolidation Loan, which gives you the option of enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. With these plans, your monthly payment is capped at a certain percentage of your discretionary income. This can be a great option if your discretionary income is relatively low.

When does it make sense to take out a private parent student loan?

If your child has exhausted all their scholarship, grant, and federal loan options, and if you have excellent credit, a private parent student loan may make the most sense. You’ll likely be able to qualify for a lower rate than what you’d receive with a Parent PLUS Loan, saving you money in interest.

Private loans may also make sense if you’d like to choose a variable interest rate. This option gives you a lower initial rate, though it can rise over time. If you expect to pay off the loan quickly, though, you may be able to keep the lower interest rate and pay off the loan before it rises."

Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity would decline at a 4.7% rate in the April-June period.

Large shifts in the composition of the U.S. workforce in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have made it harder to measure underlying productivity growth, which some economists put at about 1.0% or less, making the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation more difficult.

The firm’s termination of its tech-enabled home-flipping business, known as ""iBuying,"" follows Zillow’s announcement about two weeks ago that it was halting all new home purchases for the rest of the year. At the time, Zillow pointed to labor and supply shortages for its inability to renovate and flip houses fast enough.

In a statement Tuesday, Chief Executive Rich Barton said Zillow had failed to predict the pace of home-price appreciation accurately, marking an end to a venture the company once said could generate $20 billion a year. Instead, the company said it now plans to cut 25% of its workforce.

ZILLOW STOCK DROPS AS COMPANY PUTS HOMEBUYING ON HOLD

""We’ve determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated and continuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility,"" Barton said.

Zillow and other tech-powered house flippers, known as iBuyers, purchase homes, renovate them and then try to sell them quickly, making money on transaction fees and home-price appreciation. Zillow used an algorithm to make home price estimates, called the ""Zestimate,"" and determine what it would pay home sellers.

Ultralow mortgage-interest rates and a need for more space to work from home have driven robust home-buying demand in the past year and a half. Prices have climbed sharply in almost every corner of the U.S.

""It feels like this would be a hard time to lose money buying and selling houses,"" said Benjamin Keys, professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ""This is a time frame where prices have gone up in a lot of places, dramatically.""

In recent months, sky-high prices have forced out some buyers, and the market has showed signs of cooling off, as many economists expected. The median existing-home sales price rose 13.3% in September from a year earlier—still unusually robust, though down from 23.6% year-over-year price growth in May, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Even this gradual tapering in price growth flummoxed Zillow’s algorithm, leading the company to pull the plug on the venture.

ZILLOW RIDES BOOMING REAL ESTATE MARKET TO 70% REVENUE GROWTH

Zillow’s class C share price was down 10% on Tuesday, falling before the company announced after the market closed that it would end home flipping. Shares continued to slide in after-hours trading.

The move represents a big hit to Zillow’s top line. Home-flipping was the company’s largest source of revenue, but it has never turned a profit.

Zillow, which released earnings Tuesday, said its home-flipping business, Zillow Offers, lost $381 million last quarter, as measured by adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That resulted in a combined adjusted Ebitda loss of $169 million across all of Zillow.

Zillow has an inventory of about 9,800 homes across the United States that it is currently shopping to investors. Additionally, there are another 8,200 homes in contract it has agreed to buy. The company expects to lose somewhere between 5% and 7% on these homes, the company said.

Starting in the summer, competitors such as OpenDoor and Offerpad began to pull back from home purchases in one of the biggest home-flipping markets, Phoenix, as the red-hot pandemic market began to cool.

But Zillow accelerated, according to an analysis of sales records by real-estate tech researcher Mike DelPrete, scholar-in-residence at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Zillow also paid significantly more than those competitors for each home it purchased, buying homes priced $65,000 above the median on average, according to DelPrete’s analysis.

By October, the company had listed 250 Phoenix homes at a median-price discount of 6.2% below what it had paid for them. DelPrete called Zillow’s price blunder a catastrophic failure.

A wider look at Zillow’s national performance by analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets found it had listed 66% of homes at prices below what it had paid for them, with an average discount of 4.5%.

""The fact that Zillow can’t make it work shouldn’t be the final death knell for iBuying,"" DelPrete said. ""The other companies are making improvements, and Zillow’s not. They’re still losing lots of money.""

Zillow said it expects that the wind-down of its home-flipping outfit will take several quarters."

FOX Business has learned that Bakish once again won’t be attending the investment bank’s annual ""summer camp for billionaires"" in Sun Valley, Idaho where the rich and famous in the world of the media and finance think big thoughts and at times lay the groundwork for potential big deals.

The event officially begins Tuesday, but the top media executives began flying into the tiny hamlet 155 miles east of Boise on Monday. The resort area will for a week house more billionaires than possibly anywhere in the country. This year’s event will feature some controversial figures in media and tech such as former Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos who just days ago stepped down from e-commerce giant Amazon amid intense regulatory pressure.

'GREASE,' 'GODFATHER' TO RETURN ON PARAMOUNT+ AS VIACOMCBS MOUNTS STREAMING CHALLENGE

The Bakish-Allen & Co. contretemps stem back to 2017 when Bakish butted heads with bankers at the firm over Viacom’s planned acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive. Bakish was CEO of the then standalone Viacom. Discovery ultimately won the bidding war for the $12 billion takeover, but Bakish complained to his board about Allen’s work on the deal and banished them from further assignments. Since then Bakish hasn’t attended the high-profile conference. His last appearance came in 2017.

This year's apparent snub is more glaring given Bakish’s clout in the media business. In 2019 Bakish was named head of the combined ViacomCBS that is controlled by the Redstone family’s parent company National Amusements, thus making him one of the most powerful executives in media.

Bakish’s standing, particularly among investment bankers, could grow even more if, as rumored, he shops ViacomCBS to suitors. Such a possibility makes his absence all the more conspicuous.

A spokesman for ViacomCBS had no comment and a spokesperson from Allen & Co. could not be reached.

The 2021 event comes after a one-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As in past years, tech, media, and finance royalty are on the attendee list such as Bakish’s boss, Shari Redstone, president of National Amusements.

Investment bankers say Redstone will be shopping for deals at the conference including a possible Comcast merger, which would face significant antitrust hurdles since such a deal would have the companies combining rival broadcast networks CBS and NBC, the latter of which is owned by Comcast. Currently Federal Communications Commission rules ""prohibit a merger between any two of the big four broadcast television networks.""

One former mainstay attendee who will not be part of the festivities is former CBS chief Les Moonves who was ousted from the company in 2018 amid sexual harassment allegations. Redstone butted heads with Moonves who resisted her plan to merge both Viacom and CBS, which had been separate units controlled by Redstone’s late father, Sumner Redstone who passed away in August 2020.

When Shari Redstone combined the two companies, she appointed Bakish CEO of ViacomCBS which now controls some of the most well-known brands in media such as Paramount Pictures, CBS News, Comedy Central and MTV.

WINNERS & LOSERS IN DISCOVERY'S MARRIAGE WITH AT&T'S WARNERMEDIA

Other attendees of the event will be David Zaslav, newly anointed CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery which recently spun out of AT&T in one of the most high-profile tie-ups of the year. Bezos, who relinquished his position as Amazon CEO on Monday to Andy Jassy. Both are expected to attend while they face serious pressures from regulators in the Biden administration who want to break up the company on the grounds that it’s a monopoly.

Amazon has been on the deal-making hunt as well recently with its acquisition of MGM Studios for $8.5 billion. Meanwhile, investors have been speculating that Amazon will split its stock when Bezos steps down to get retail investors interested in its shares which closed Friday at a whopping $3,510.

The e-commerce giant's stock has been pretty stagnant over the past year, only posting 8% returns year-to-date. Investors believe a stock split will help drive the stock price higher.

Aside from Bezos, other big names in attendance include Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Netflix’s Reed Hastings, Comcast’s Brian Roberts and WarnerMedia’s Chief Executive, Jason Kilar. Bill Gates is also said to be on the list following a tumultuous year for the Microsoft founder including a divorce and rumored ties with the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein.

Gates also stepped down from Microsoft’s board in March of 2020 amid an investigation that he had an affair years ago with a Microsoft employee. A spokesperson for Gates said the decision to step down from the board was unrelated to the affair, which ended amicably.

Deal talk already circulating at Sun Valley ranges from mega-media deals to smaller streaming takeovers. Aside from finding a possible suitor for ViacomCBS, Lionsgate, the independent movie and TV studio, has long been said to be an acquisition target. John Feltheimer, CEO of Lionsgate, will be one of the big names in attendance. Also reportedly being shopped around is NFL Network and possible suitors could include Fox Corp, the parent company of FOX Business Network, bankers say.

Another big theme investors are watching is the rise in popularity of the video gaming space. Since the start of the pandemic, the video gaming industry has exploded, now worth more than $180 billion. Heads of gaming companies like Activision Blizzard Entertainment and Epic Games are expected to be in attendance, possibly looking to strike up deals of their own."

The dispute involves around 5,000 parking spaces the city and bondholders agreed to give the Yankees as part of the development project – a complex, multi-year effort to bring economic growth to the poor South Bronx neighborhood Yankee Stadium calls home.

The development included a new stadium for New York City’s professional soccer team, New York City F.C., a hotel and retail stores on grounds that currently house parking lots and garages for Yankee games that the city is mandated to provide under a 2007 agreement with the team. It would be financed with private money arranged by a consortium that includes a housing developer and the owners of the soccer team.

BITCOIN, CRYPTO IN MLB NO LONGER OUT OF LEFT FIELD

Bonds issued in 2007 to build the parking facilities have fallen into default in recent years, while the parking garages owe the city millions of dollars in back taxes. The consortium also agreed to pay $50 million to restructure the defaulted debt.

For years, city officials and bondholders have said they were eager to find a solution to the Yankee parking imbroglio and until last week, all indications were that they had one.

But Yankee officials say the city and bondholders have reneged on a key piece of the deal that has put the entire project on hold indefinitely and possibly forever. That deal involved a guarantee of first-class parking for its fans even as the team agreed to reduce the city’s initial 9,000 plus parking space commitment.

A term sheet providing details of the agreement between bondholders, the city’s Economic Development Corporation (EDC) and the Yankees were reviewed by FOX Business.

""I’m very disappointed,"" said Yankee President Randy Levine, a former prosecutor and top city official under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani who was the architect of the redevelopment proposal. ""This would have gone a long way to salvaging the bonds plus we were going to spend a billion dollars in private money to revitalize this area that would produce thousands of good paying jobs.""

Levine added: ""The deal broke down over the bondholders and the city refusing to do what they agreed to do in the bond offerings and in the terms sheets.""

A spokeswoman for New York City's EDC said it was the Yankees who were backing out of promises made to get the deal done. She would not elaborate.

In a statement, EDC President Rachel Loeb said, ""After years of negotiations with the New York Yankees and other parties, we are disappointed they will not commit to promises already made to the city and the community and attempted to change key terms of the deal only days before a community board vote.""

A spokeswoman for Nuveen told Fox Business: ""Nuveen remains committed to the transaction set forth in the term sheet and looks forward to a continued strong relationship with the Yankees and the City.""

MLB OPENING DAY: GEORGE STEINBRENNER IV TALKS YANKEES BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS AMID COVID

The blowup of the agreement could have significant political repercussions for the next mayor of New York City, who will need to make economic redevelopment a top priority following the COVID-19 pandemic that saw businesses close amid strict city-wide lockdowns.

Bill de Blasio, the current mayor, is leaving office next year under mandated term limits. It’s expected that the winner of the recent Democratic primary either Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams or former New York City Sanitation Commissioner Kathyrn Garcia, will become the next mayor in the heavily Democratic city. Both are locked in a tight race and votes are still being counted.

The controversy surrounding parking for the Yankees has been a long-running problem that began with the construction of the new Yankee Stadium in 2006. Under a deal with the city, the Yankees are guaranteed 9,127 spaces by a non-profit that runs the garages, Bronx Parking Development Corp., documents show. Starting in 2007, the company issued more than $200 million in debt to construct garages and make other renovations to maintain ""first-class"" parking facilities for Yankee fans.

But the garages have fallen into disrepair and are anything but first-class these days. Many fans now take nearby suburban trains and city subways to travel to Yankee Stadium. The parking bonds have been in default for years and trade at distressed levels.

Management of the Yankees led by Levine, came up with a possible solution in 2018. Since the Yankees are part owners of NYCFC – a franchise with Major League Soccer – with the Abu Dhabi royal family, Levine cobbled together a proposal to finance the soccer stadium with private money on spaces now occupied by the Yankees parking. To get community buy-in, the Yankees teamed up with a developer to provide low-income housing, a new school and other amenities to the neighborhood.

The Yankees agreed to give up their rights to 9,127 spaces for something closer to 5,611 as long as the parking lot was maintained, the document shows. Bondholders' debt would be restructured as part of a new company.

Nuveen, which holds most of the bonds, would be the primary beneficiary of the $50 million payment.

The $1 billion project was expected to create thousands of jobs for a neighborhood that routinely ranks as among the nation’s poorest. All parties signed off on the term sheet which described the city’s and the bondholder's commitments to provide the roughly 5,000 parking spaces for the Yankees. The neighborhood’s community board was expected to vote on the measure this month.

But the Yankees say last week the deal was upended when the city’s EDC – the lead city agency handling the deal – and Nuveen balked at a parking space guarantee even at the reduced numbers that the Yankees wanted in the official contracts of the redevelopment.

Both are said to fear that such specific guarantees could open the entities to future litigation and that specific ""third-party beneficiary rights"" were never part of any deal. Yankees officials counter that all they were doing was codifying guarantees in the earlier agreement, and in the term sheet, albeit at a lower number of spaces.

City Economic Development officials tell FOX Business that they are still hopeful a deal can be worked out that satisfies both parties and that the community board can vote on the project sometime in the Fall.

But according to Levine, it appears the two sides are deadlocked over the semantics of what the city and the bondholders consider a guarantee. ""I tried to explain to them that the company emerging out of bankruptcy should guarantee these spots because that’s what the bond issuance was for—providing parking for Yankee Stadium and the community,"" Levine said. ""It made no sense to us why the city and the bondholders didn’t want to guarantee these spots. They just don’t want to guarantee what they agreed to in the past and that's provide Yankee fans and the community with parking."""

And the answer they’re getting is a resounding ""yes.""

FOX Business has learned that top c-suite officials from the big banks have been setting up meetings with the relatively new chairman of the SEC in recent weeks to get a better idea of his agenda as head of Wall Street’s top cop.

Gensler was nominated by Democratic President Biden for the post and was confirmed by the Senate in April. People who have met with him say he hasn't yet fully moved into his office at the commission's Washington, DC headquarters. They say he is still largely working from his home in nearby Baltimore.

FEDS ACCELERATING CRYPTO WORLD CRACKDOWN

From his home office, however, Gensler is plotting to be a ""transformational"" SEC chair, according to Wall Street executives who know him. His top priority, he has signaled to these people: significant changes in what corporations must disclose to the public that reflect certain political, environmental and social goals an increasing number of investors are demanding.

Gensler is also telling executives that he will not ignore the traditional parts of his job and will be looking to enhance protections for small investors who have flooded the market in recent years, embracing risky financial products on a scale not seen since the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.

""He's worried about small investors getting ripped off, but the highest priority will be the new disclosure rules that appeal to the environment and issues like that,"" said one c-suite executive who asked not to be named.

An SEC spokesman had no comment.

Gensler, well-known and mostly well regarded among the Wall Street elite given his long years as a banker at the prestigious investment house Goldman Sachs and later while serving in various government finance-related roles including chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under former President Obama.

SEC PICKS AS CORPORATE REGULATOR A PROFESSOR WHO CRITICIZED STARTUP ‘UNICORNS’

His politics have transformed over the years from a left-of-center liberal on financial issues to someone who now embraces progressive edicts from the likes of Democratic Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fierce critic of corporate America. Wall Street executives say Gensler is so close to Warren he often confers with her on policy issues. A spokesman for Warren didn't return a call for comment.

Gensler's political beliefs are said to be at the center of his new – and according to some observers radical agenda – as SEC chair. He wants to impose new disclosure rules sometime before the end of the year that will force companies to go beyond alerting investors about financial issues that can materially impact their holdings. That will mean corporations will have to disclose issues about their carbon footprint, board-room diversity and other non-financial issues. It's unclear what exactly Gensler will be asking in terms of these new disclosures, but Wall Street executives say he is telling people he and his staff will provide details by the fall.

The disclosures will certainly draw criticism from some corporate executives and GOP politicians who believe Gensler is overstepping his role as a regulator of markets by embracing progressive political issues.

But Gensler appears undeterred. ""He is really serious about this stuff that probably comes right from Elizabeth Warren’s office,"" said one attorney who deals with major corporations on their dealings with the SEC. The attorney said Gensler will pass the rules through a party-line vote since Democrats outnumber Republican commissioners 3-to-2.

Other issues Gensler will focus on are those he believes involve more typical Wall Street abuse of small investors. He's said to be worried that there's not enough disclosure when retail investors buy shares of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies or SPACs. This is a new way a company can go public by being acquired by a shell company that buys several different ventures. Gensler is worried that small investors who buy shares at initial public offering are getting crushed with fees that aren't levied on big investors who sponsored the product.

SEC MULLS GAMESTOP, AMC ‘GAMIFICATION’ CRACKDOWN WITH REGULATORY LAYER

One particular concern in the SPAC space for Gensler is the so-called celebrity SPAC where movie stars and professional athletes lend their names to the SPAC even though they have no investment expertise, these people add.

Also on his list, as previously reported by FOX Business, the issues of payment for order flow and the gamification of trading. Payment for order flow is the system that allows small investors to trade for free or at a low cost through discount brokerages. Brokers sell their order flow, or buy and sell orders, to other financial firms to match the orders. The financial firms make money on the bid-and-ask spread and by handling so many trades even fractions of a penny could add up to enormous profits.

The SEC chairman is worried the system gives financial firms matching the orders--like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial--an unfair information advantage in the markets. One option he has discussed: Forcing discount brokers to send more of their trades to public exchanges where there is more transparency.

Gensler appears to be still grappling with how to regulate the so-called gamification of trading, where discount brokers appear to lure unsophisticated investors to their platform through gimmicks and incentives without properly disclosing the risks involved in trading. Wall Street executives say clues to how Gensler will regulate gamification might be found in the upcoming IPO documents for trading app Robinhood, which has been in negotiations with the SEC about becoming a public company via its private filing.

Robinhood, which offers trading with no fees, is planning to come public later this summer; its IPO document known as an S-1 will be publicly released imminently."

FOX Business has discussed the costs with Wall Street executives, analysts and think tank leaders, and while no exact estimate can be determined, the SEC’s new disclosure mandates involving everything from the environment to board diversity is likely to cost U.S. public companies well into the billions of dollars.

Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, known for his progressive leanings, has put at the top of the commission’s voting agenda new rules that will mandate disclosing information on so-called ESG or Environmental, Social, Governance issues. These issues involve a public company's commitment to alleviate climate change and other non-financial disclosures.

SEC PICKS AS CORPORATE REGULATOR A PROFESSOR WHO CRITICIZED STARTUP ‘UNICORNS’

Gensler met with President Biden and other top financial regulators on Monday to discuss climate-related financial risks and how regulators can push the president’s green and social agenda through edicts aimed at public companies. Gensler has said such disclosures are being demanded by a new breed of investor looking to make corporate America more socially responsible.

But critics such as business groups, and GOP lawmakers say the move by the SEC is part of a broader effort by the Biden administration to force companies to embrace a progressive social agenda. They also contend the commission is exceeding its authority that has traditionally focused on protecting small investors from financial fraud.

Gensler is forging ahead, however, and given the political makeup of the commission with Democrats outnumbering GOP commissioners by a 3-to-2 majority, he is likely to push through his new disclosure mandates possibly by the end of the year, say people with knowledge of the chairman’s thinking.

According to the proposed new disclosure standards, companies must ""ramp up disclosures regarding their climate change-related risks,"" and ""enhance (company) disclosures about the diversity of board members and nominees.""

SEC MULLS GAMESTOP, AMC ‘GAMIFICATION’ CRACKDOWN WITH REGULATORY LAYER

While there is a contentious debate about the need for such disclosures, one thing is certain: Companies will be spending significant sums of money on both lawyers and consultants on how best to disclose a corporation’s carbon footprint and the new diversity mandates.

For example, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, estimates that the new corporate disclosure rules will cost ""billions of dollars"", and possibly leading to lower shareholder returns. The group also warns of massive legal liabilities as progressive activists challenge the veracity of the corporate disclosures since the SEC rule, at least in its current proposed form, is amorphous and thus leaves room for various interpretations.

""It’s not a one size fits all approach"", says Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors. ""ESG reporting is so vague, there’s really no way to quantify it.""

An SEC spokesman declined to comment, but the woke disclosure rules have their support in certain areas of the financial business that has focused on ESG investing. Blackrock, the world’s largest money manager, is offering a slew of new ESG funds that screen for companies that meet ESG standards but also charge investors higher fees than other funds offered by the company.

Blackrock’s CEO, Larry Fink, has been an advocate of social investing and using Blackrock’s clout (it manages nearly $9 trillion) to push for these reforms at the companies it invests in. The firm recently voted to place on the board of oil giant ExxonMobil three activist shareholders from the ESG-centric fund, Engine No 1.

""I think spending billions (on these disclosures) is exaggerated,"" said Columbia law professor John Coffee, an expert in corporate governance matters. ""And as Engine No. 1 proved with Exxon, shareholders appear willing to vote for such goals.""

Some Wall Street analysts say the size of the costs for these disclosures could easily run into the billions of dollars as they spend money on consultants to prepare for the additional disclosure, plus in the case of banks, they may also be barred from doing business with companies that are deemed fully committed to the woke policies.

""Mandated disclosures could impact (banks) bottom line because they might be forced not to lend to companies and businesses that don't meet the ESG standards,"" said Dick Bove, an analyst at Odeon Capital.

Also, the costs will fall disproportionately on smaller public companies that don’t have the same cash on hand and the staff to deal with the new legal issues.

""This whole ESG thing is just one giant waste of time and money,"" added Whalen Global Advisors chief, Chris Whalen, ""It’s just a big show that only benefits the consultants and the lawyers who are making money off of this."""

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT IS ‘DECEPTIVE MARKETING’, WILL HURT STRUGGLING AMERICANS, ECONOMIST SAYS

The department said the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 9.1% in June from a year ago. Prices jumped 1.3% in the one-month period from May. Those figures were both far higher than the 8.8% headline figure and 1% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists.

The data marked the fastest pace of inflation since December 1981.

Price increases were extensive with energy prices rising 7.5% in June from the previous month and up 41.6% from last year. Gasoline, on average, costs 59.9% more than it did one year ago and 11.2% more than it did in May. The food index, meanwhile, climbed 1% in June, as consumers paid more for items like cereal, chicken, milk and fresh vegetables.

Summer staples, including hotdogs, have been costing more as well. Hot dogs increased by more than 16% compared to the same time last year and ice cream rose more than 12%.

FOX Business’ Madison Alworth spoke with Jersey Shore business owners who said people are still spending money on food in the area, but are now budgeting amid the inflationary environment.

Cali Coulter, the owner of The Food Shack in Point Pleasant Beach, noted that her customers have been changing their habits as a result of the price pressures.

""Maybe they are not getting the crumb cakes as an appetizer or they are not getting that extra side of home fries, they are just sticking to what will fill them up and they will be out the door,"" she said.

Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

Getting a personal loan can be difficult if you have a limited credit history or bad credit. Some lenders that target bad credit borrowers promise no credit check and fast funding. But these loans often come with expensive fees that can trap you in a cycle of debt.

If you’re struggling to choose the right personal loan — or finding it flat-out impossible — you may start to feel discouraged. Before you settle for an expensive loan product, though, here are some bad credit loans that you should avoid — whether you just need a few hundred dollars, want a $10,000 loan , or anything in between.



Credible makes it easy to see your prequalified personal loan rates from various lenders, all in one place.

1. Payday loans

A payday loan is a small, short-term loan intended to tide you over with an advance until your next payday. Storefront payday lenders typically offer these loans, but you may also find them online. Depending on your state, there may also be a maximum borrowing limit, often $500 or less. Lenders usually require borrowers to repay these loans in two to four weeks’ time, in one lump sum, plus fees.

If you’re struggling to make ends meet before your paycheck hits, this can seem like an enticing loan option, especially if you need same-day funds .

Why you should avoid them: Most payday loan lenders don’t have strict credit- or income-based qualifications, so they often loan money to people who may struggle to repay the debt . Additionally, these loans are notoriously expensive. While most states cap the interest that can be charged per $100 borrowed, this is usually in the range of $10 to $30.

While that may not sound like too much, when you consider the length of the loan term and the low borrowing limits, these fees work out to an astronomical APR. For example, a $100 payday loan with a two-week repayment term and a $15 fee equates to an APR of nearly 400%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

Compare that to the average interest rate on a 24-month personal loan — 8.73% in May 2022, according to the Federal Reserve — and it’s easy to see what a ""deal"" payday loans really work out to be.

2. Cash advance loans

A cash advance loan is similar to a payday loan, in that you can use its short-term funds to help you cover immediate or unexpected expenses. These loans can even be funded as quickly as the same day, depending on the lender.

Cash advance loans differ from payday loans in some important ways, though. For starters, you can usually borrow a lot more with a cash advance loan, with some lenders offering as much as $5,000. You don’t always have to repay a cash advance loan in just a few weeks, either; you may be able to take out a cash advance that you can repay in monthly installments.

Why you should avoid them: Cash advance loans are still significantly more expensive than traditional personal loans, or even credit cards. Depending on the lender, your cash advance loan could have an APR of 299% or more.

3. Car title loans

If you have bad credit and need to borrow money, using your vehicle as collateral to get a car title loan could be one option. But car title loans aren’t a good choice for most borrowers.

Title loans often have repayment terms as short as 30 days, though you might find installment options as long as 24 months. The amount you can borrow depends on your location, as well as the value of your vehicle — as long as you own your vehicle free and clear.

Why you should avoid them: The downside? You probably already guessed it: You’ll pay significantly more in interest with a title loan than with a traditional personal loan. It’s not uncommon for car title loans to have APRs in the triple digits.

More than that, though, you’re securing the loan with one of your most important assets: your car. If you were to default on your title loan, the lender could take ownership of your vehicle.

4. Pawn shop loans

A pawn shop loan is a short-term loan that’s secured by something you own, such as jewelry or other valuables. These loans typically allow you to access money quickly, depending on how much your valuables are worth.

Pawn shop lenders typically don’t run a credit check, so these loans can seem like a good option for borrowers with poor credit or those looking for a no-credit-check loan . The pawn shop will usually offer a percentage of the pawned item’s value in loan form. You’ll need to repay the loan by an agreed-upon date, or the shop keeps the item.

Why you should avoid them: If you repay the loan as agreed, you can get your valuables back. But your pawn shop loan will have accrued interest in the interim, which you’ll also need to pay. These loans also tend to have a variety of fees tacked on, such as storage, setup, and even appraisal fees. For this reason, a lower interest rate can be deceptive, as the loan will actually end up costing you considerably more in the end.

Try a personal loan instead

If you need funds for an unexpected expense, large purchase, or even to refinance high-interest debt, a traditional personal loan is often your best bet — even if you have bad credit. Here are some things you can do to increase your chances of qualifying for one:

Apply with a cosigner. Adding a cosigner with good credit to your personal loan application may be the answer to getting approved or snagging better interest rates. Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit.

Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit. Check your credit reports. If your low credit score is keeping you from getting a personal loan, it’s important to understand why. Check your credit reports to see what sort of negative items are bringing down your score. In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected.

In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected. Consider a secured personal loan. A secured loan uses one or more of your assets as collateral for the debt. Because of this added protection, lenders often have lower credit score requirements for secured loans and may even approve borrowers with a bad credit score. Some financial institutions might not even require a minimum credit score at all, as long as you’re securing the loan with an asset. But keep in mind that if you fall behind on your loan payments, the lender can take your collateral."

WHAT IS CASH-OUT REFINANCING AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

How mortgage rates have changed over time

Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac — 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates.

If you’re ready to take advantage of current mortgage refinance rates that are below average historical lows, you can use Credible to check rates from multiple lenders .

How to get your lowest mortgage refinance rate

When is it worth it to refinance?

Refinancing a mortgage can be a great way to save money. But it’s not always the best move for every homeowner.

People refinance for a number of reasons, including to get a lower interest rate, change their monthly payment amount and lower their interest costs. Generally, if you can lower your interest rate by at least 0.75%, refinancing might be a good move.

But before you refinance, be sure to weigh closing costs, and calculate how long it will take before your savings from the refinance cover the expenses of refinancing.

Generally, a good mortgage rate is one that’s the lowest you can qualify for based on your individual factors, such as credit history, income, other debts, down payment amount, and more.

A rate that’s good for your financial situation should result in a monthly mortgage payment that you can manage, while leaving plenty of room in your monthly budget to put toward savings, investments, and an emergency fund.

BNPL INCLUSION IN CREDIT REPORTS CAUSES GROWING CONSUMER CONCERNS, SURVEY CLAIMS

Americans coping with rising prices

Inflation is currently surging and increased in June to a new 40-year high, marking the fifth time it's broken that record this year. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 9.1% annually in June, hitting its highest point since November 1981, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

Because of this, many consumers are needing to dip into their savings or fund their purchases with credit, according to data from Morning Consult Economic Intelligence . Intentions to buy big-ticket items such as electronics, trips and vacations, home appliances and furniture have all decreased over the past year.

But despite these setbacks, consumer balance sheets are historically strong, according to Morning Consult. Net wealth as a share of disposable income is currently near a record high as household debt as a share of total assets is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, according to data from the Federal Reserve.

Because of this, some consumers, especially from higher-income households, are actually increasing their spending and expected spending, according to the Morning Consult report. Households with an annual income of at least $50,000 reported a 25% increase in monthly spending from May 2021 to May 2022.

""To put it simply: People still have the means to buy things, but they are expecting items to cost more,"" the report stated. ""And Morning Consult data indicates that they’re using BNPL to pay for some of them. The consistency with which U.S. consumers have used BNPL to fund their purchases throughout 2022 indicates that the payment form may be helping to keep their price sensitivity and substitutions at bay, and should be viewed as an indicator of the staying power of BNPL.""

If you have used BNPL to pay for your purchases and want to pay it down, consider using a personal loan to help pay your debt. Visit Credible to compare multiple lenders at once and choose the one with the best interest rate for you.

The use of BNPL payments is not slowing, and the share of adults who used BNPL to fund a purchase at least once in the past month has not dropped below 16% in 2022, according to Morning Consult’s report.

Adults with annual income between $50,000 and $99,999 as well as those with an annual income of $100,000 or more are even more likely to have used BNPL for a purchase over the past month at 21% and 20%, respectively.

And consumers expect to continue using BNPL.

""As more retailers partner with BNPL providers and more payment providers create their own BNPL offerings, adoption and strong usage will likely continue,"" the report stated.

Even as consumers purchase less big ticket items, they will continue to use BNPL for a wide variety of other purchases. Morning Consult’s report showed 35% of respondents used BNPL to purchase apparel, 32% used it to purchase electronics and 23% used it for footwear.

""I loved living there with the expansive view of the city and ocean,"" she said.","The Beverly Hills estate of 1930s star Greta Garbo is on the market for $12 million.

The home, which was built in 1937, was originally designed for the actress and her then-boyfriend, conductor Leopold Stokowski, the conductor for Disney’s ""Fantasia."" It’s now listed by Mark Mintz at Compass.

The property, which sits atop a hill in the Beverly Crest neighborhood, has six bedrooms and six bathrooms. It features sprawling 180-degree views spanning from downtown Los Angeles to the ocean and includes a spacious deck, lush lawns and an infinity pool. The space, which was fully renovated in 2006 by celebrated designer Nicole Sassaman, highlights open living areas, sliding glass doors, rich woods and stonework throughout.

NYC APARTMENT OF HOLLYWOOD LEGEND GRETA GARBO HITS MARKET FOR $7.25M: ‘CINEMATIC VIEWS'

The Oscar-nominated star, who was fiercely protective of her privacy, saw to it that the home kept her out of the public eye. In her lifetime, Garbo famously said, ""I just want to be left alone."" The original small windows, along with the towering exterior walls, provided a space for Garbo to leisurely roam and sunbathe in seclusion. The courtyard, which was enclosed by high walls, was well beyond the reach of photographers. It became a hot spot for Hollywood's elite to gather.

Garbo and Stokowski ultimately called it quits, and he went on to marry heiress Gloria Vanderbilt in 1945. Garbo kept the house, and it was eventually occupied by several tenants, including singer/actor Tab Hunter. A Russian filmmaker, who is the current homeowner, loved the home’s history so much that he bought it under ""Greta Garbo LLC.""

After earning three Academy Award nominations, Garbo retired at age 35 and moved to New York City, where she became a known recluse. Garbo passed away in 1990 at age 84.

Sassaman, who was also captivated by the home’s history, spent nearly two years remodeling the space, which was transformed into ""a modern marvel,"" Elle Decor reported. She doubled the living space by erecting a second story.

""The hilltop view was stunning, but the estate didn’t take advantage of it because the house had been built to keep the inhabitants in and the press out,"" Sassaman told the outlet. ""We added as much glass as city code would permit, and this tactic transformed the home from dark and secluded to open and airy.""

Sassaman also made changes to the layout of the home to enhance its charm. A patio was converted into a living room with panoramic views of both the city and the infinity pool. Garbo’s bedroom became a home office, and the primary suite was installed on the newly constructed second floor. Another outdoor patio was enclosed and added to the kitchen, which provided more space to cook, dine and entertain.

The lower bedroom and bath, previously a guest room during Hunter’s residency, became a gym. Each space in the property was specifically tweaked by Sassaman to ensure a view.

""I worked to meld the worlds of yesterday and today together,"" she said.

The curved fireplace in Garbo’s original master bedroom was retained, as was the home’s sinuous exterior. Sassaman said she also kept the home’s unusual lines to stay true to Garbo’s time.

""The first time I saw the house, I couldn't believe that it had been sitting in such a poor state for so long,"" said Sassaman. ""But I immediately saw how the home could be turned into something really special if I just let its glamorous past guide the renovation.""

Sassaman told the outlet that she stayed at the estate while building the pool and retaining wall in the backyard. She admitted it was easy to fall in love with it.

""It has kind of a long NASCAR history, which is pretty cool,"" he said.

Stenhouse reportedly purchased the home in 2013 and is now looking to pass it on as he builds a new home for himself and his fiancé.

Even though there’s a chance the future buyer will be involved in the racing industry, Tucker said the home also appeals to equestrian lovers and car collectors outside the community.

I’m going to have a grand ballroom that could hold 500 people.
He deserves to see his dream come true and I’m going to do it for him.
Siegel: That’s a good example.","Jackie Siegel is determined to finish building the largest single-family home in America – no matter the cost.

The Florida mom and her family, whose lives were the subject of the 2012 documentary ""The Queen of Versailles,"" is back for the Discovery+ docuseries ""The Queen of Versailles Reigns Again."" The show explores the challenges the 56-year-old and her husband David Siegel have endured in finishing the construction of their home, a project that has been more than 20 years in the making.

The 90,000-square-foot mega-mansion, inspired by the Versailles palace in France, features six kitchens, a 35-car garage, a 150-person dining room, a grand ballroom with gemstone-encrusted floors and a British pub. Siegel also has big dreams to have a Benihana hibachi grill installed and an aviary with toucans and flamingos. When done, the mother of eight suspects the home could be worth $200 million.

The Siegels have faced numerous obstacles over the years. After buying the land for the home in 2000, construction was halted during an economic downturn that impacted patriarch David Siegel, founder of Orlando-based Westgates Resorts. The family also endured a personal tragedy when their 18-year-old daughter, Victoria Siegel, passed away in 2015 from an overdose of methadone and antidepressants.

JILL ZARIN HEADS BACK TO 'HOUSEWIVES' AFTER BUILDING BUSINESS EMPIRE: 'IT WAS LIKE I NEVER LEFT'

Today, Siegel is feeling hopeful about the future of her family – and home. And she’s inviting cameras to follow her along for the ride. Siegel spoke to FOX Business about when the home will finally be completed, how she coped with the public scrutiny following her daughter’s death and the challenges she’s currently facing.

FOX Business: What compelled you to share your story in ""Queen of Versailles Reigns Again""?

Jackie Siegel: It’s been a rough road since the original documentary came out. A lot of offers came to us over the years, but we were very wary of how we were going to be portrayed. And then we lost our daughter. My world just crumbled down from there. It felt like nothing mattered anymore. I felt such sadness. I had lost my passion to do anything. It was a sad, dark time in my life.

But then, my husband and I started our foundation because we felt we could make a difference. We felt we were in a position to help others. I felt ready. When we were approached this time around, I felt the timing was right. The foundation had become a big part of our lives… And the truth is, everywhere I go, people always approach me and ask me the same question – whatever happened to the house? So this is my answer. It covers everything people have been wanting to know.

FOX Business: The show chronicles the challenges of building a house as large as yours. Why continue to create the largest single-family home in the country?

Siegel: The thing is we’ve already got over $50 million into the house. No one is going to buy it as is. And it’s my husband’s passion. We’re not getting any younger and our kids are growing up. I want to do this for him. And the house certainly has the queen’s touch. I want to live here as a family and the structure is already there. Right now we live on a private island in the middle of the lake that we bought in the meantime. Had we gotten this property first, we probably wouldn’t have built this other house. But it’s already under construction.

Also, my kids are getting involved. They’re really excited about this project. I’m also thinking about the possibilities. I’m going to have a grand ballroom that could hold 500 people. I could do a lot of events there to raise awareness and save lives from the drug epidemic. I can use the house to gain the attention that we need to raise awareness. I could host fundraisers, do a retreat or just invite people for a charity event where I can educate them. It will also be good for our kids, our grandkids and loved ones. We already have the home and own it. Why not see it through? I've got to find a way.

FOX Business: When do you believe the house will finally be finished?

Siegel: My goal is to have the house finished by May 3, 2023. That’s my husband’s 80th birthday. He almost missed his birthday last year because he was getting back surgery and was at the hospital. He caught pneumonia and at his age, that’s really scary. He deserves to see his dream come true and I’m going to do it for him.

FOX Business: What do you believe has been the biggest challenge you’ve faced recently in getting the house completed?

Siegel: The biggest problem is that there’s more than one problem *laughs*. The house was dormant for many years and wasn’t maintained. So I have issues with the natural aging of the house. The marble was falling off the exterior, and other areas were exposed and rusty. I had to structurally fix a lot of things, which I wasn’t anticipating. So it’s almost like it was under renovation at the same time we're constructing it.

We had to knock down walls and things like that because I’m redesigning the kids’ bedrooms. They no longer need a nanny’s room connected to their room. They rather have a large closet. And with the COVID pandemic, a lot of things slowed down in terms of the supply chain. For example, the floor of my grand ballroom is going to be made with semi-precious stones. These are beautiful stones from 22 different countries all over the world. And then we had to ship them to Indonesia. I went to Indonesia to check on the floor and do some quality control, which I’m glad I did because we still had to make changes.

There’s so much to oversee. Like the library, it’s going to have one of the most ornate wooden floors you’ve ever seen. We’re going to have an artist create something for us and this is his last project before he retires. He’s out in the country outside of Paris making our floor for us. We have to come up with the design for everything – and everything is a piece of art. This is more than a home. This is a palace.

FOX Business: Your home is even going to have a British pub among its many features. Did you originally have an idea for something that just didn’t work out?

Siegel: I needed a larger closet… but I couldn’t have two stories. I want to have a closet with an elevator so I can go up or down from my house. That’s a challenge. I originally wanted to find a way to connect the house to the island where you can do some zip-lining. But there are lots of high restrictions and things need to be approved. There are code issues as well. But if the sprinklers go off, for example, the artwork would be ruined. I had to put a fireproof stairwell that’s so ugly and takes up space, but it was necessary.

FOX Business: A big dream of yours, among many, is to have a Benihana built inside the home. How’s that going?

Siegel: That’s a good example. We have to take it out… But my husband really wants it. And our family is so picky when it comes to food, but one thing they all love is Benihana. They will all show up for that. We can all sit at the table together and everybody’s happy *laughs*. That’s the main reason he wants it.

FOX Business: What’s a misconception you feel the press or the public still has about you?

Siegel: … People that I’ve never met, of course, think that I married for money. But then when they see me, they’re the first ones to go, ""Oh my God, we love you."" *laughs*. My life isn’t about flashing money around and showing off. We’re doing all of this for us. We’re private people, except our story is exposed to the media.

BETHENNY FRANKEL REFLECTS ON HER BUSINESS EMPIRE, SKINNYGIRL'S FUTURE: 'I LIKE THAT BLOOD, SWEAT, TEARS'

… But the truth is, my family and our future come first. I’m still a small hometown girl at heart. My boys told me, ""Since we’re building a house like this one, we should really have a family crest."" If you would have asked me what a family crest was, I would pull out a tube of toothpaste! I’ve always been the same.

FOX Business: What kept you going after losing your daughter?

Siegel: … It was difficult, losing your child and then having the headlines bash family… Meanwhile, you’re mourning and wondering, ""What did I do wrong?"" But you can’t live with guilt your whole life. And those newspapers actually did us a favor because they pushed me and gave me the strength to speak about our experience publicly so that other parents are spared from going through a similar pain.

This notoriety puts me in a position where my voice can be heard. And it helps me to know that my daughter didn’t die in vain, that her story is, in some way, saving so many other lives. That so many people are learning about the impact of the opioid crisis. It helps with my healing process."

John McGraw, former chairman of McGraw-Hill Publishing, and his wife, Marjorie, were the first to purchase the property from the Garbo estate in 2017 for $8.5 million.

The McGraws took it upon themselves to renovate areas of the home, such as the kitchen and dining room, while preserving much of the home's Garbo-fashioned elements and spaces.

""This home is for the discerning buyer who is seeking dramatic, cinematic river and city views and the elegance that defined Garbo.""

Listing agent Brian Lewis of Compass Real Estate disclosed in an interview with Fox News Digital that the McGraws are choosing to sell the apartment now that they're spending a majority of their time away with family.

They would rather the home be enjoyed by ""someone who can really be there.""

And it’s not only with Marilyn items.","Marilyn Monroe’s market value is still shining brightly 60 years after her death.

The Hollywood actress, also known as America’s most famous sex symbol, died in August 1962 at age 36. According to reports, the star had a net worth of $800K at the time of her death, which is nearly $8 million in today's money.

Monroe’s net worth in 2022 is a reported $10 million. In 2020, she ranked No. 13 on Forbes’ list of highest-paid dead celebrities due to her image and name being used by nearly 100 brands globally. A fictionalized version of the star is the subject of an upcoming Netflix film, ""Blonde,"" which has received an NC-17 rating.

Scott Fortner, a lifelong fan, is determined to keep Monroe’s legacy alive by preserving some of her most prized possessions. Fortner, who is considered an authority on Monroe, assists major auction companies in authenticating and verifying memorabilia.

REMEMBERING MARILYN MONROE, ACTRESS, FASHION ICON, AND SEX SYMBOL 60 YEARS AFTER HER DEATH

He owns the world’s largest private collection of Monroe’s personal property and archives, which he shares on both his website and social media.

This year, he’ll be celebrating her life at several events at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California.

Fortner spoke to FOX Business about how he became a sought-after collector and why Monroe is more valuable than ever and offered his advice for fans eager to obtain an authentic piece of history.

FOX Business: How did you end up becoming a Marilyn Monroe memorabilia collector?

Scott Fortner: Like anyone, you’re just taken by someone or find yourself very interested in a particular figure. That’s what happened to me when I was probably 12 or 13. I was really fascinated by Marilyn Monroe. I started collecting books and magazines as I read and learned more about her. This continued through adulthood.

Then, in 1999, her entire estate was put up for auction at Christie’s in New York. That auction really set the stage for celebrity auctions. I acquired the catalog from the auction, which became another book for my collection. But then I started to see some items from the 1999 sale that were being resold online on eBay and at other auction houses.

I thought to myself, ""Why am I collecting books and magazines when I could be collecting items that Marilyn owned?"" That’s how it started over two decades ago. … This isn’t an organization or a company investing in these items for business purposes or other concepts. I just happen to be a fan who’s lucky enough to collect.

FOX Business: Do your items ever get loaned out to museums or is it strictly private?

Fortner: As someone lucky enough to obtain these items, I feel a bit of an obligation and a duty to share them with the rest of the world and give other fans an opportunity to see Marilyn through her objects in the same way that I do.

I loan my collection for exhibitions. It’s been on exhibit around the world. I’ve often participated in opportunities to raise money for charitable causes. For example, some items have been on display to raise money for the actual orphanage where Marilyn lived as a child, which is still in business today.

FOX Business: What’s your process like in finding authentic memorabilia?

Fortner: When I first started, I didn’t know much about the auction business as we know it today. Over the years, I’ve come to learn more about the auction industry. I’m now connected with most of the major auction companies around the world, such as Christie’s, Julien’s Auctions and Heritage. Those are your top auction companies for entertainment memorabilia.

I’m also pretty well known in the collecting community. A lot of times people will reach out to me privately to see if I might be interested in purchasing something that they may have. I believe networking and learning are really important if you want to expand your collection. And I’m always looking for the next thing to add to my collection.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

FOX Business: How many items do you currently own?

Fortner: I don’t have an exact number anymore. I stopped counting. But it’s in the several hundreds.

FOX Business: What would you say is your crown jewel?

Fortner: The item that I get asked the most about is Marilyn’s personal Pucci blouse. During the last few years of her life, she wore Pucci quite a lot. It was an Italian designer that she discovered, which shifted her look away from the ‘50s, such as the tight skirts and sweaters. It was a more modern, easier look. She had several Pucci items in her closet. She was also buried in a green Pucci dress. So the brand has become synonymous with Marilyn.

The blouse I own happens to be the blouse she was wearing in the photos taken on the weekend before she passed away, the last photos ever taken of her alive. It’s the item I get frequently asked about in terms of selling. It’s not for sale. I’m a collector, not a dealer.

The most recent item I’ve added to my collection is something I’ve wanted for quite some time. It’s a pair of Marilyn’s Ferragamo high heels. The white Ferragamo high heel was a go-to look for her. There are countless photos of Marilyn wearing them throughout the ‘50s and ‘60s. It’s a new staple in my collection that I added just last month.

MARILYN MONROE’S FIGURE-HUGGING GOWN BECOMES TOP SELLER AT AUCTION: SHE’S ‘STILL TURNING HEADS TO THIS DAY’

FOX Business: Which item was the hardest for you to obtain?

Fortner: Marilyn attended a benefit for the Actor’s Studio. She was an usherette. People would come into the theater, and Marilyn would escort them to their seats and hand them a program. I’m sure that must have been quite the experience to be escorted by Marilyn. She wore an ensemble that consisted of an evening dress and a matching cape. That item came up for auction several years ago. I bid on the item and was told that I had won. It turned out that it didn’t make the minimum bid or the reserve.

A lot of times, a seller will say, ""If it doesn’t reach this certain amount, I’m not going to sell the item."" I found out after the auction and I went through the grueling process of attempting to negotiate with the seller. I bought it privately after the fact. It took several months for that to happen. But I was fortunate because it’s probably one of Marilyn’s most well-known public events. Now I have that cape as part of my collection.

FOX Business: Marilyn passed away 60 years ago. Why do you believe she’s more valuable than ever?

Fortner: For starters, she’s an icon. And I think people relate to her in so many ways today. Some people just enjoy her photos. Others enjoy her films. Some people relate to the personal struggles that she endured throughout her life. What I often find is that people feel a connection to her. There’s a sense of wanting to protect her. I think her appeal is very broad. And it’s not just in the United States — it’s worldwide. I’ve connected with other collectors and fans around the world, so her reach is very extensive and long-lasting. She’s an icon of beauty, for fashion and a legend of the silver screen.

FOX Business: How difficult is it to find and buy authentic Marilyn memorabilia today?

Fortner: What I’m seeing now is that people are very much holding onto their collectibles and memorabilia because it is increasing in value as time goes by. So whenever there is an auction, the number of pieces available can be very limiting. And Marilyn is one of those people whose value doesn’t decrease. She holds value and increases in value. So people aren’t as quick to put up their items for auction. Therefore, the availability is getting harder.

MARILYN MONROE'S DRESSES FROM POPULAR MOVIES UP FOR AUCTION

FOX Business: How can one determine whether an item is authentic or not? What are some tell-tale signs you look out for?

Fortner: One of the first things you want to do is ensure you’re verifying authenticity. Where did the item come from? Did it come from that 1999 Christie’s sale or another auction sale, such as from Julien’s? You want to make sure it came from a major auction company and verify the year it was originally sold. Also, is there a photo that can be matched with the item? Is there a photo of Marilyn wearing the item, whether it was at home or a public event? Many items from my collection are photographed with Marilyn.

What I tell people to avoid is what I call second- or third-generation items, such as a seller saying, ""Marilyn gave this to me."" Those items usually come with a letter or certificate of authenticity. Those items are very risky purchases and, usually, they’re not authentic. There’s a huge market today, particularly on eBay, where people will create certificates of authenticity claiming this is an authentic item when, in reality, it was probably something acquired from a secondhand store. They’ll just purchase the item, create a letter of authenticity, and then sell it for thousands of dollars on eBay. Unfortunately, many people tend to believe an item is real just because it comes with a certificate claiming it came from Marilyn’s makeup artist or hairstylist. Usually, that’s not the case.

I’m so often contacted by people who say, ""I’ve got this item for sale, and here’s the letter of authenticity for it."" I’m in the position of having to tell them, ""This item is not real, and here’s how I know that."" A perfect example involves Marilyn’s foster sister, Bebe Goddard. Marilyn lived with the Goddard family for some time. [Later on], Bebe worked with a memorabilia dealer to create items that he sold for her, which were fake pieces. They even went as far as to spray Chanel No. 5 on those items. After she passed away, it was verified through her documents that these items were sold to people. Just because it was someone who was a part of Marilyn’s life, people believed they were real. And these items came with a certificate of authenticity claiming they were real.

Today, people continue to create these fake letters of authenticity. And it’s not only with Marilyn items. It’s with all kinds of celebrity memorabilia. There are a few real items on eBay that are authentic. I would advise people to stick with the major auction companies.

Also, autographs are very easy to forge. Today’s printers are so good. You can easily take a check, even an authentic Marilyn-owned check, and do a photocopy on the front and back. Then you’ll frame that item in a display case. A lot of times, people will do that. And, of course, many will think it’s real when, in reality, it’s just a copy. There are many other ways people forge signatures, even in autograph books and photographs. You have to do your homework and make sure that the item you’re purchasing is truly authentic.

FOX Business: What about if you’re a Marilyn fan and want to own something that once belonged to her? What’s the first piece of advice you would give them?

Fortner: My first piece of advice is to make sure this is something you’re going to have interest in the long-term, not just a spur-of-the-moment purchase. You don’t want to have buyer’s remorse. Also, set a budget. Auctions can get very emotional. It’s also very competitive. For some people, they just want to win. You want to make sure you set a budget and try not to go over it.

People also tend to forget there are premiums that the auction companies apply as part of selling an item, as well as taxes. I have come across people who don’t realize that, after winning an auction, there’s a certain percentage on top of that for the premium and then another percentage on top of that for state taxes. It does add up. I would also stick to the major auction companies, especially if you’re starting.

FOX Business: Every year, Marilyn continues to be one of the top-earning dead celebrities. How is she earning top dollar today?

Fortner: Marilyn’s estate is owned by Authentic Brands Group, which is a company that owns the rights, licenses, marketing, advertising and branding for many deceased celebrities. They license Marilyn’s name and image to people who want to promote certain products. She’s still very much in demand, which is why Marilyn is one of the highest-earning dead celebrities today."

Jobs reportedly presented the Apple 1 to Paul Terrell, the world’s first personal computer retail shop owner.

The Apple 1’s demonstration is said to have happened at Terrell’s computer store which was named The Byte Shop, in Mountain View, California, and the demo led Terrell to request a fully assembled computer that would later be sold for $666.66.

Eventually, Terrell submitted a purchase order of 50 Apple 1 computers.

Although the prototype is missing pieces and has visible cracks on its upper right side, RR Auction said the computer’s new owner can recreate components based on the photographs Terrell captured.

Both Ukraine and Russia are thought to be using DJI drones in combat, even though the company maintains that its products are intended for civilian use.

Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykhailo Federov wrote an open letter last month appealing to DJI to block sales of its drones in Russia, contending that Russian troops were using ""DJI products in Ukraine in order to navigate their missiles to kill civilians.""

The AeroScope system installed in DJI drones allows the detection and monitoring of other drones and their operators in the vicinity via special receivers. The worry is that Russians might be using the AeroScope system to attack Ukraine drone pilots.

DJI has rejected claims that it leaked data on Ukraine’s military positions to Russia, after German retailer Mediamarkt cited Russia’s use of DJI drones in the war as a reason it removed the company’s products from its shelves.

Last week, DJI said in a statement that its drones are not marketed or sold for military use. It said it ""unequivocally opposed attempts to attach weapons"" to its products.

What happened was just the opposite, and as the Supreme Court considers President Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate and COVID-19 testing rules for the nation’s businesses, justices should look closely at what appears to be a successful test of whether requiring vaccinations will be the key to the nation moving safely back to normal.

CTA, the consumer technology trade association that represents the $422 billion U.S. consumer tech industry and runs CES, decided to create its in-person show model from scratch. CTA President and CEO Gary Shapiro didn’t waver even as more than a dozen tech leaders scrubbed their travel plans. He insisted the show would go on.

In fact, it would be more than just another Vegas convention: it would be the first large-scale test in the nation of whether a massive indoor event drawing thousands of people from all over the world could be pulled off in the middle of a highly contagious pandemic without turning into a superspreader event.

How CES Tackled the Challenge

It wouldn’t be easy. Well before omicron was even identified, CTA began preparing. It put in a mass order with Abbott Labs for the company’s BinaxNOW COVID-19 rapid self-test kits and began working with health experts and Nevada’s Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak to formulate the protocols and the plan.

Upon arrival in Las Vegas, attendees would be required to present that proof at one of dozens of booths CES set up at airports, hotels and the convention center, after which they’d be handed their official credential and two free rapid COVID-19 tests. Masks would be required at all times on the convention floor and the 10 other CES venues around the city. Journalists could only remove their masks during live interviews. There would be free rapid testing at the convention center for the duration of the four-day event. The convention center, which spans more than 4 million square feet of exhibition space, was outfitted with enhanced air filtration systems, and international travelers would get a free PCR test after the show ended.

On Dec. 30, the nation set a devastating record: the highest number of daily infections reported.

By Dec. 31, citing the need for additional safety measures, CES announced it was dropping the last day of the four-day convention.

Business television networks Bloomberg and CNBC pulled out. My crew and I were still in. I made my pact when I chose this profession. Given a choice, I would run toward news stories. As a local news reporter, I’ve covered Category 5 hurricanes, riots, crack house busts and toxic explosions. Frank Merola, one of the FBN photographers coming with me to Vegas, had rushed to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster to cover it for the network. We would remain vigilant the entire trip.

Experts Weigh In

I won’t say I wasn’t concerned. I reached out to Dr. Harry Sax, executive vice chair of surgery at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. When I told him I was going to cover CES, he thought for a moment and then said, ""I think it’s important that you go. As long as you mitigate risk. Think about it. We don’t want planes to crash, but the answer isn’t ‘don’t fly planes.’ That’s not acceptable or realistic. The answer is, mitigate risk as best you can and then move forward. This vaccine-only event appears to be aiming for that. CES will be a test observed by the world.""

What It Was Like

Armed with a healthy dose of paranoia, my team and I arrived in Vegas on Jan. 4 to find greatly diminished crowds. At its peak in 2019, CES drew 170,000 exhibitors and leaders. This time, the final tally would shrink more than 70% to just over 45,000. But just as big names pulled out, 2,300 small- and medium-sized businesses, along with major names from Samsung to Chrysler parent Stellantis to smartphone chip giant Qualcomm to farm equipment maker John Deere (which brought a 44,000-pound autonomous tractor), arrived.

VIPs, including a dozen members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, attended. In order to maintain social distance, organizers limited tables to seven people each vs. the usual 10.

Did It Work?

Sunday, CTA gave some final numbers. More than 2,300 businesses had voluntarily bought into the mandate and made the trip to CES, as did 4,500 attendees. Shapiro told FOX Business, ""At this point, I am aware of only a few positive COVID tests of actual CES attendees."" While he declined to give specific numbers because CTA was still compiling exact figures, I can say not one of my crew tested positive, even though there were points during the three-day conference when we were surrounded by crowds. Because of the CES rules, those crowds were all masked and vaccinated.

As the Supreme Court ponders whether the federal government has the authority to impose such mandates, leaving it up to businesses to impose mandates appropriate for their workforce is a good idea and CES proves that businesses will buy into such a policy when it furthers their business interests. Moreover, the mandates required by CES appear to have worked.

So, however the Supreme Court rules, businesses should stick to a mandate policy. If 45,000 people congregating indoors can avoid being a superspreader event because of vaccination and mask mandates, then let's have corporations spread these super best practices far and wide."

How to detect spyware

Spyware surreptitiously gathers information about you, such as internet usage data, and then sends it to another party. The most malicious spyware will install software that changes the settings on your phone and/or steals usernames and passwords.

It typically lands on your phone along with a program or app that you installed yourself. ""Spyware often accompanies programs that are disguised as useful software, such as download managers, registry cleaners, and so on,"" Internet security company Kaspersky says.

DHS REQUIRES 'CRITICAL' PIPELINES TO AMP UP CYBERSECURITY PROTECTIONS IN WAKE OF COLONIAL PIPELINE HACK

In some cases, spyware is secretly installed by a parent but it may also be installed by a suspicious partner, according to a spyware primer from Avast, which offers internet security applications.

Some indicators of spyware can be an overheating phone, a battery that drains too fast, excessive data usage, and annoying messages that pop up when you’re browsing the internet, Avast says.

How to remove spyware

Think you have spyware? Spyware removal tools may help in detecting and removing it. Anti-virus companies such as McAfee offer spyware removal apps.

You can also manually remove suspicious apps that you don’t recognize. Just follow iOS or Android instructions for deleting apps on your phone.

In a worst-case scenario, you can do a factory reset of your phone. This will erase all data from your phone, including the spyware. But you need to make sure the backup you use for the reset is dated before you got the spyware, says Avast.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

One of the best strategies is to make sure your phone’s operating system software is up to date.

""Some iPhone spy software is effective only because of an iOS security flaw. Hackers are always looking for software vulnerabilities to exploit, which Apple regularly fixes via Apple security updates,"" says Avast. So, the best way to stop the spyware is updating to the latest iOS release."

Weird to normalOne of the worst things about change is that the new way of doing things just feels weird.
Having the ability to accept and respond well to necessary change is going to become more important with every passing day.
Therefore, I invite you to rewire yourself in this way: to learn to think and feel differently about change; to become change-capable.
Erika Andersen is the founding partner of Proteus, a coaching, consulting and training firm that focuses on leader readiness.","Think of the last time your boss, your boss's boss or an HR person told you that a change was coming – some new way to do something, or a restructuring, or a new system to learn.

If you’re like most people, your first reaction was probably more negative than positive. Perhaps something like: ""Arrgh, as if the past eighteen months haven’t been stressful enough…"" – along with a sinking feeling and a sense of being newly overwhelmed.

Why is the idea of change – especially change imposed upon us – so often unwelcome? Given the past few years of massive change and disruption on so many levels, you’d think we would have gotten used to non-stop personal and professional change by now.

Our Anti-Change Wiring

Blame our experience as a species. For most of human history, change has been dangerous; the safest course of action has generally been to return to the known. If there was a famine, you wanted to get back to eating regularly. If there was an invading army, you wanted to get back to peace and prosperity.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS

You get the idea. Most of the time, returning to a previous set of stable conditions was the way to go.

Over many thousands of years, this has resulted in most people seeing most change as a threat. But today, to be successful, we often have to make changes in how we work, who we work with, and how we deal with customers.

So, what’s a human to do? Try these five things:

1. Find out more

When an unexpected change comes at us, we often just shut down and stop listening after the word ""different."" But there’s some key information about any change that will help you decide how best to respond. First, ask for more clarity about what the change is – what it means for you, practically. Then ask why it’s happening, so you get some sense of possible benefits. Finally, ask the person promoting the change what the post-change future will look like – how it will affect the business, the customers, the employees. Having this key information can make the change start to seem less overwhelming and more understandable.



2. Difficult to doable

Most often, when we first hear about a change, we assume it’s going to be difficult – that we won’t know how to do it, or that others will make it hard to do. Instead, turn your mind toward how you could make it easier. Is there someone who already knows how to do what you’re being asked to do, who could help you? Is there training available? Can you talk to your boss about what it will take?

3. Costly to rewarding

We also tend to think that a change is going to take away more than it gives us: that learning how to do it will take time we can’t spare or that it will hurt our reputation – that we’ll look bad trying to do something we’re not used to doing. The change will seem less daunting if you can also focus on how it might be rewarding: maybe the new way of doing things will take less time, once you’ve learned it, or will solve a problem that you know customers have been complaining about.

4. Weird to normal

One of the worst things about change is that the new way of doing things just feels weird. Anyone who’s ever had to learn to drive a stick shift as an adult, for instance, or gone to a religious celebration of another faith, knows that feeling of ""this just isn’t what I’m used to.""

Making a change feel normal is an important way to get past our hesitation, and sometimes the quickest way to do that is to find someone you like and respect who understands and is doing things in the new way and ask them to share with you what feels OK about it to them.

5. Practice makes perfect … or at Least OK

And finally, perhaps, the most important way to get comfortable with a new way of doing things or thinking about things is to do it. And then do it again.

If you think about anything you’ve learned as an adult – from swing dancing to speaking another language, to using a new social media platform – you probably remember the day when you had practiced enough that you suddenly thought, ""Oh, this isn’t so hard."" Once you’ve gotten some basic information about the change and started to look for ways it could be easy (or at least doable), rewarding and normal, take a deep breath and just jump into trying it out.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

Every indication is that the pace of change in our lives and in the world is going to continue to increase. It doesn’t look like we’re ever going to return to a time when everything is mostly status quo. Having the ability to accept and respond well to necessary change is going to become more important with every passing day.

Therefore, I invite you to rewire yourself in this way: to learn to think and feel differently about change; to become change-capable. It’s your best path to a successful, satisfying personal and professional life in this era of non-stop change.

Lore last week unveiled plans for his utopia, called Telosa, from the ancient Greek word Telos, meaning ""highest purpose.""

""The mission of Telosa is to create a more equitable, sustainable future. That’s our North Star,"" Lore said in a promotional video. ""We are going to be the most open, the most fair and the most inclusive city in the world.""

WALMART INVESTING NEARLY $1B TO COVER TUITION, BOOK COSTS FOR US EMPLOYEES

Key to the city’s plans is Lore’s economic vision, called ""Equitism,"" in which the land upon which the city is built will be donated to a community endowment.

Residents, in turn, own their homes on the land and are enriched as home values increase, according to the project’s site, and after a period of ""hyper-growth,"" residents can buy the land from the community endowment.

""If you went into the desert where the land was worth nothing, or very little, and you created a foundation that owned the land, and people moved there and tax dollars built infrastructure and we built one of the greatest cities in the world, the foundation could be worth a trillion dollars,"" Lore told Bloomberg Businessweek.

""And if the foundation’s mission was to take the appreciation of the land and give it back to the citizens in the form of medicine, education, affordable housing, social services: Wow, that’s it!""

The city is meant to take on what Lore views as the United States’ biggest challenge — the rapidly growing wealth gap, which he said ""is going to bring down America.""

""While the current economic system is a growth engine, it has led to increasing inequality,"" the project’s website explains. ""Equitism is inclusive growth.""

The initial phase of the project, targeted for completion by 2030, would be built to accommodate 50,000 residents across roughly 1,500 acres at a cost of $25 billion, Businessweek reported.

Over 40 years, the city will eventually require $400 billion in funding and grow to house as many as 5 million people across 150,000 acres, the site says.

The project’s planners have yet to commit to a location, but the website identifies Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Texas and the Appalachian region as possible sites.

In June, Lore hired Copenhagen-based architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group to design the city.

Sleek renderings imagine plenty of space for pedestrians to stroll in the lush metropolis, and include images of planes and other aircrafts that appear to be from Archer Aviation, the electric ""air taxi"" startup in which Lore is an investor.

Another image on the site shows a skyscraper called Equitism tower that houses elevated water storage, aeroponic farms and an energy-producing roof.

The streets ""prioritize bikes and pedestrians,"" according to the website, and slow-moving self-driving cars share the street.

Lore, who reportedly has a net worth of up to $4 billion, founded Quidsi, a company that owned e-commerce sites including diapers.com, and sold it to Amazon in 2010 for around $545 million.

He left Amazon after two years and founded Jet.com before selling it to Walmart in 2016, joining the retail giant as head of US e-commerce.

The chronic entrepreneur left the company earlier this year to pursue other projects that were unannounced at the time.

He’s since bought a stake in the Minnesota Timberwolves and Lynx, and started a new venture capital firm with Alex Rodriguez called Vision Capital People.

The typical living costs for a full-time college student during the 2022-23 academic year will range from $20,470 on a low budget to $30,560 on a moderate budget, according to College Board . That’s a substantial chunk of change for college students already tasked with covering their school tuition, often with student loans.

The good news is student loans cover more than just tuition. You can use student loans to pay for living expenses like room and board, transportation, and miscellaneous costs. Here’s a closer look at how to pay for college living expenses, including what you can and can’t pay for with student loans.



Credible lets you compare private student loan rates from multiple lenders, all in one place.

You can use student loans for living expenses

Your lender generally disburses student loan funds directly to your school to pay for your tuition and fees. Any remaining funds are paid to you, and you can use the money to cover living expenses and other costs related to your education.

Before you apply for student loans , always begin by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) . Schools use this form to determine what types of federal aid you qualify for. Exhaust all your FAFSA options — like scholarships, grants, and federal loans — before turning to private student loans to bridge any funding gaps.

Student loans backed by the federal government provide access to better benefits, like low, fixed rates, access to income-driven repayment plans, and the potential for loan forgiveness. Additionally, federal student loans may be easier to obtain if you have bad credit since they don’t require a credit check or consider your credit score.

Also, keep in mind that some student loans come with limits which will determine your borrowing amount. You might receive more money if you’re a graduate student, as graduate student loans typically carry substantially higher limits than undergraduate loans.

For example, undergraduates may qualify for a Direct Unsubsidized Loan with limits ranging from $5,500 and $12,500 per year, depending on whether you’re a dependent or an independent student. By contrast, student loan limits for graduates and professionals top out at $20,500 per year.

The amount you may borrow in private student loans varies from lender to lender, but many offer loan amounts up to 100% of the cost of attendance.

What expenses can you pay for with student loans?

Student loans are intended to help you pay for expenses that fall under the cost of attendance (COA) for your school, including:

Tuition

Education-related fees, such as registration, graduation, and parking

Textbooks

Room and board

Housing utilities

Housing supplies

Transportation expenses

Computers

Food and meal plans

Dependent care

Disability expenses

Consult with your school’s financial aid office to determine the COA for your school and for more information on acceptable uses for student loan funds.



If you need to take out private student loans, visit Credible to compare private student loan rates from various lenders in minutes.

What can’t student loans be used for?

The list of expenses you can pay for with federal or private student loan funds is extensive, but there are exceptions. Aim to keep your student loan debt low by being mindful of how you spend your loan funds, and try to use them sparingly for essential expenses as necessary.

Along those lines, you can’t use student loans for unapproved expenses, such as:

Clothing

Video games

Business expenses

Down payment on a home

Entertainment

Vacations

New vehicle (but gas, operation, and maintenance expenses are allowed)

Remember, when you sign for a student loan , you agree only to use the money to pay for your education and related expenses. If the U.S. Department of Education discovers that you used student loan funds for unapproved expenses, they may cancel your loan agreement and seek immediate repayment.

Other ways to pay for living expenses while in college

Student loans aren’t the only way to pay for higher education. Here are some alternative options:

Apply for gift aid. Paying for college doesn’t have to involve debt. Federal grants and college scholarships can help you get the money you need, and you don’t have to repay them.

Can you get a student loan with a 600 credit score?

In most cases, if you have bad credit, your options may be more limited if you want to qualify for a private student loan on your own — many lenders typically require good credit and a steady source of income to qualify.

Some lenders may offer student loans for borrowers with bad credit , but these loans may come with higher interest rates compared to loans for borrowers with good credit. You can consider taking out a loan with a cosigner who has good credit so that you can increase your chances of qualifying for a loan or of getting a better rate.

It’s important to find a cosigner you trust and to look for a loan that offers a cosigner release if you want that option. When doing your research, see if the lender offers a cosigner release option and what the requirements are. For example, some lenders may require you to make a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments before you can apply for a cosigner release."

Moving students into separate housing, she said, ""is kind of closing the barn door after the horse is gone.""
""The method or approach to providing content and makeup work for the students is at the instructor's discretion,"" the school said.","Colleges this fall are no longer treating Covid-19 as an emergency upending their operations, shifting to eliminate mask requirements and mandatory coronavirus testing and letting students who contract the virus isolate in their dorms with their roommates.

With easy access to vaccinations and low hospitalization rates among college-aged adults -- even during the latest surge in BA.5 subvariant cases -- administrators said it is time to lift or at least rethink restrictions and redefine the virus as endemic, not a pandemic. That means scaling back mass testing, removing bans on large indoor gatherings and preparing for a fall term that more closely resembles life before Covid.

Another issue driving the decisions is exhaustion, according to public-health experts and academics on several campuses. Students and staff have been subjected to two years of daily health checks, weekly trots to a testing center and a roller coaster of mask protocols.

""It really comes down to a change in mind-set,"" said Ken Henderson, who was co-chair of Northeastern University's Covid-management operations until the group disbanded in January. Citing clinical therapies and the reduced severity of current variants, he said, ""We've pivoted significantly to more living with the virus.""

DESPITE HIGH INFLATION, BACK-TO-SCHOOL SPENDING PROJECTED TO HIT $37B

Northeastern is mandating vaccines and boosters for the fall, but already eliminated indoor mask mandates and surveillance testing and no longer offers dedicated isolation space for infected students.

""Campuses are moving in the direction of pretending Covid is no longer an issue,"" said Chris Marsicano, an assistant professor of educational studies at Davidson College who has been tracking colleges' responses to Covid since early 2020. ""When there's a flare-up, treat the flare-up. Don't have restrictions all the time.""

That should be fine for most students and staff who are vaccinated and not immunocompromised, said A. David Paltiel, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health. But ""indifference to off-campus transmission and transmission to more vulnerable members of the community is a little bit heartbreaking.""

Schools said they could still reverse course if variants lead to more-severe illness or local health officials recommend changes.

One of the biggest changes schools are making is dropping surveillance testing of asymptomatic students and staff, and, with that shift, abandoning online dashboards that tracked cases and positivity rates the past two years.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION CANCELING $6 BILLION IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR 200,000 BORROWERS

The College of Charleston in South Carolina isn't requiring students to show negative Covid-19 tests upon arrival this fall, said Alicia Caudill, executive vice president for student affairs. The school did require entry testing last year. She said the college will have thousands of at-home tests and KN-95 masks for students who want them.

""You have to make the best decisions for yourself,"" rather than relying on blanket policies from the school, Ms. Caudill said.

Georgia Institute of Technology did away with asymptomatic surveillance testing in July and instead will study wastewater to try to detect large outbreaks.

Dr. Paltiel said that approach makes sense, given how quickly the latest Omicron subvariants seem to be spreading, and how virulent future strains might be.

""You're sounding like the generals who are always getting ready to fight the previous war,"" he said of schools sticking with old approaches, like mandatory weekly testing.

Most schools are maintaining vaccine mandates, but some are adjusting who is covered by the rules or exactly what counts as being vaccinated.

BOSTON UNIVERSITY ISSUES LARGEST TUITION INCREASE IN 14 YEARS, BLAMES INFLATION

The board of trustees at San Joaquin Delta College in California voted last month to remove vaccine and booster requirements for students.

""We're trying to be flexible while recognizing that we really do need to provide in-person services,"" said spokesman Alex Breitler, adding that unvaccinated students previously couldn't participate in hands-on programs.

The State University of New York's Orange County Community College isn't mandating boosters this fall, while the San Diego Community College District no longer requires vaccines for students. The district maintains a mask mandate.

Schools are often issuing guidance that students who test positive for Covid isolate in place, meaning they lock down in their dorms, even with uninfected roommates, rather than moving to other designated housing while contagious.

In its guidance for the fall, Cornell University recommended that students who test positive ""wear a high-quality mask at all times except when eating, sleeping or using bathroom facilities (e.g., showering, brushing teeth).""

University of California, Irvine, set aside 166 beds for isolation housing this fall, down from 362 in the spring. David Souleles, director of the school's Covid-19 response team, said that is partly in response to updated guidance from public-health officials. Cutting isolation beds will also free up more beds for the general student population in the midst of a housing crunch.

MISSOURI UNIVERSITY AGREES TO $1.65 MILLION SETTLEMENT IN COVID-19 LAWSUIT FROM STUDENTS

Leslie Bienen, a public-health researcher at Oregon Health and Science University-Portland State University School of Public Health, said that by the time one roommate tests positive for Covid, chances are anyone else they lived with was already exposed.

Moving students into separate housing, she said, ""is kind of closing the barn door after the horse is gone.""

As in-person classes once again become the norm, schools are scaling back their online and hybrid offerings -- including for students who fall ill.

How mortgage rates have changed over time

Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac – 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates. When considering a mortgage refinance or purchase, it’s important to take into account closing costs such as appraisal, application, origination and attorney’s fees. These factors, in addition to the interest rate and loan amount, all contribute to the cost of a mortgage.

Everyone’s situation is different, but generally, it may be a good time to refinance if:

You’ll be able to get a lower interest rate than you currently have.

Refinancing will save you money over the life of your home loan.

Your savings from refinancing will ultimately exceed closing costs.

You know you’ll be staying in your home long enough to recoup the costs of refinancing.

You have sufficient equity in your home to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI).

If your home needs significant, costly repairs it might be a good time to refinance in order to withdraw some equity to pay for those repairs. Just be aware that lenders generally limit the amount you can take from your home in a cash-out refinance.

The Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF generally invests in U.S. Treasury bonds that mature in three to 10 years.","In 1994, financial planner William Bengen laid out a compelling case for a very simple retirement withdrawal strategy that is now commonly known as the 4% rule. His work showed how an investment strategy diversified across common stocks and intermediate-term Treasury bonds could help a retiree navigate a 30-year retirement with very little chance of running out of money.

Today, in the age of low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on indexes, it becomes pretty simple to create such a portfolio with just two funds. For stocks, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is certainly worth considering. For intermediate Treasury bonds, it's hard to beat the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury Fund Index ETF. Put those two ETFs together in an intelligent way, and they could very well wind up being all you need for retirement.

How the 4% rule works

Bengen's work that came up with the 4% rule focused on retirees who maintained a well-diversified portfolio that was somewhere between a mix of 75% stocks and 25% bonds and a 50-50 mix of the two. He looked back across historical market returns and inflation rates and assumed that a retiree would want to maintain a steady lifestyle throughout retirement, after accounting for inflation.

With those assumptions in place, he checked to see how much a person could withdraw every year and still have a very strong chance of winding up completing a 30-year retirement without running out of money. He calculated that by keeping that diversified and balanced portfolio, a retiree could start by spending 4% of the portfolio's initial account balance and adjust those withdrawals for inflation each year.

Say, for instance, that you expect to need $48,000 a year in retirement ($4,000 per month) to cover your costs and that Social Security should provide you around $1,500 per month. Since Social Security adjusts its payout for inflation each year, you'd need your nest egg to cover the other $2,500 per month -- $30,000 per year. Thanks to the 4% rule, it looks like you could cover that gap with a nest egg of $750,000 across the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight and the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETFs.

Why include the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF?

The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF invests in the same companies that make up most S&P 500 trackers, but it does so a little bit differently. While the typical S&P 500 fund is market-capitalization weighted, the Invesco ETF uses an equal-weighting strategy. In other words, it seeks to own about the same dollar amount in each company in that index.

That gives the Invesco ETF a leg up on diversification, as by market capitalization, the top 10 companies (11 securities due to different share classes) represent nearly 30% of the index. By contrast, in the Invesco ETF, the top 10 holdings represent less than 2.7% of the fund's holdings. That means the Invesco fund is less exposed to challenges that face the largest companies in that index than the typical S&P 500 fund is.

It offers that diversification benefit while still carrying a modest 0.2% expense ratio, which means that the fund's shareholders get virtually all the returns of owning the underlying stocks. Between that modest expense ratio and that diversified portfolio of S&P 500 stocks, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is worthy of consideration for the stock allocation of your retirement portfolio.

Why include the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF?

The Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF generally invests in U.S. Treasury bonds that mature in three to 10 years.

That time frame is important. As an intermediate-term bond fund, it doesn't own the bonds with the shortest or the longest maturity dates. That three-to-10-year range can provide a sweet spot where the bonds offer higher interest rates than the shortest-term bonds but don't fall in price nearly as far as long-term bonds can when rates rise.

In addition, as an ETF that owns Treasury bonds, it faces a fairly low default risk. The U.S. government can print dollars while generally borrowing in dollar-denominated bonds. While printing money can drive inflation, that combination -- along with the government's ability to tax -- does provide a very high likelihood that U.S. Treasury debt will be paid.

Although intermediate-term Treasury bonds are not likely to provide a high rate of return over time, they do offer more stability of pricing than stocks do. That's why they play a role in the 4% rule: to make sure you have some higher-certainty money available when you need spending cash. With a nearly invisible 0.05% expense ratio, investors in the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF get the benefits of owning those bonds for very low overhead.

Two funds for a great future

The beauty of these two ETFs is that not only can they be the core to your plan once you retire, but you can also use them while you're accumulating your retirement nest egg as well. With a longer time horizon while you're still working, you'll likely want to tilt your allocation more heavily toward the stock fund.

As your retirement approaches, you'll want to draw closer to the balanced allocation that's so important when you're spending down your nest egg. Still, you can get away with just these two ETFs and have a great shot at making it to (and through) a financially comfortable retirement.

Planning on hold

More than 40% of the general population put their retirement planning on hold during the pandemic, and that number was even higher, at 55%, among young investors ages 18-35. In fact, nearly half of respondents from that next generation said they do not even see a point in saving for their later years until things return to ""normal.""

Of the next-geners who quit their jobs during the Great Resignation and had a 401(k), 1 in 5, or 21%, cashed out their accounts after leaving.

""The fact that so many people who left their jobs as a result of the Great Resignation also cashed out of their 401(k)s may be cause for concern,"" said Rita Assaf, vice president of retirement at Fidelity. ""Taking money out of your retirement accounts completely should be avoided unless the immediate need is critical and there are no other options, not only because of the tax implications, but also due to the impact on your retirement nest egg.""

Inflation emerges

Although a majority of Americans expressed optimism that hang-ups from the past two years are behind them, with 65% of those polled telling Fidelity that 2022 is their year for waving goodbye to the pandemic and looking to the future, numbers show a new fear has emerged: inflation.

One of the biggest concerns Fidelity observed was that 71% of Americans are worried about inflation's impact on their retirement planning — and almost one-third don’t know how to make sure their retirement savings keep up.

But this is no time to panic, Assaf says.

""The encouraging news is, rising costs might not be as big a threat to your retirement lifestyle as you may fear,"" she told FOX Business.

Funds -- ETFs in particular -- can also make you a millionaire, even though many of them never beat the market.
Since you're targeting millionaire status by retirement, you'll want a higher percentage of stock ETFs versus bond ETFs.
That growth rate should be attainable over 20-plus years in a retirement portfolio that's heavy on stock ETFs.
CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSSeven figures via ETFsYou can retire a millionaire with ETFs.","Can you retire a millionaire with ETFs alone? The simple answer is yes, you can. Here's how.

You don't have to beat the market

It's a common belief that investors get rich by picking individual stocks and beating the market. While that can be true, stock picking isn't the only path for investors to build wealth. Funds -- ETFs in particular -- can also make you a millionaire, even though many of them never beat the market.

In truth, the broader market provides enough growth potential to build a seven-figure retirement fund. Follow the four rules below to harness that market power and achieve your wealth goals without having to pick a single stock.

INFLATION-FIGHTING ETFS: HOW TO INVEST

1. Choose efficiency

Funds have administrative expenses that they pass along to shareholders. Those expenses dilute the returns of the underlying stock portfolio. If you choose cost-efficient funds, a greater portion of the ETF's earnings flow through to your bottom line.

Expense ratio is the metric you'll use to compare funds on cost efficiency. You'll see this number presented as a percentage that's some fraction of 1%, say 0.10%. A 0.10% expense ratio equates to expenses of $10 for every $10,000 you have invested.

Some index ETFs have expense ratios that are close to zero. iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, for example, both have expense ratios of 0.03%.

THIS VANGUARD ETF COULD MAKE YOU A MULTIMILLIONAIRE WITH ZERO EFFORT

If your 401(k) doesn't offer low-cost ETFs, ask your administrator if your account has a brokerage window. Or, invest in these funds in an IRA or taxable brokerage account instead.

2. Plan your asset allocation

Asset allocation is the composition of your portfolio across different asset classes, like stocks and bonds. Stocks deliver growth, with some risk, while bonds provide stability. You can mix and match the two to tailor your portfolio's risk and reward characteristics.

Since you're targeting millionaire status by retirement, you'll want a higher percentage of stock ETFs versus bond ETFs. If retirement is still decades away and you can handle some volatility, you could hold up to 90% stock funds. Start with a lower percentage if retirement is within 15 years or if stock market volatility makes you nervous.

3 BETTER WAYS TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT THAN A 401(K)

3. Invest generously and consistently

To amass seven figures with ETFs, you must invest generously and consistently -- for decades. The numbers below show monthly contributions required to get to $1 million on different timelines. Note that the monthly contributions could include your employer match.

$2,265 → 20 years

$1,518 → 25 years

$1,054 → 30 years

$748 → 35 years

$538 → 40

All scenarios assume average annual growth of 6%, which is a bit less than the stock market's long-term average after inflation. That growth rate should be attainable over 20-plus years in a retirement portfolio that's heavy on stock ETFs.

You can see that the monthly contribution gets unmanageable if you wait too long to start investing. That's your cue to kick this plan off today. Even if you're 30 years out from retirement and you can't afford to contribute $1,000 monthly, invest whatever you can today. You can raise your contribution later as your income increases.

4. Don't time the market

Whatever happens with the stock market, commit to staying invested and continuing your contributions. If you start pulling back on contributions or selling to avoid losses, you may never hit that million-dollar target.

It may sound counterintuitive, but selling to avoid losses usually lowers your returns. For example, the market drops, so you sell at a lower share price to stop the bleeding. You then wait until the market has stabilized to reinvest. At that point, you buy back your shares at higher prices than when you sold them for. Selling low and buying high creates a loss, which reduces your long-term returns.

If you stay invested when the market goes sideways, you don't have to worry about when to reinvest. You also remain well positioned to benefit when the market recovers.

Seven figures via ETFs

You can retire a millionaire with ETFs. The strategy is to ride the market's long-term growth trend. For that to work, you must choose low-cost funds, be strategic about your asset allocation, and invest consistently over time -- without getting spooked by market fluctuations.

3 SOCIAL SECURITY SECRETS FOR EVEN BIGGER CHECKS2.","Knowing when you'll quit the workforce is a crucial part of retirement planning, but few people give as much attention to where they're going to retire. Yet it's worth thinking about if you haven't already.

Where you live can drastically affect the cost of your retirement and how far your savings will go. Here's a closer look at three ways your home can affect your retirement expenses.

BEST STATES FOR RETIREMENT IN 2022: REPORT

1. Some states tax Social Security benefits

When calculating your retirement income, you may assume that all your Social Security checks will go directly into your pocket. But that's not always the case. The following 13 states tax some of their residents' Social Security benefits:

1. Colorado

2. Connecticut

3. Kansas

4. Minnesota

5. Missouri

6. Montana

7. Nebraska

8. New Mexico

9. North Dakota

10. Rhode Island

11. Utah

12. Vermont

13. West Virginia

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

But living in one of these places isn't a guarantee that you'll owe anything. Each state has its own rules, but most only take a cut of your benefits if your annual income or Social Security benefit exceeds certain thresholds.

If you live in one of the above 13 states or you intend to do so in retirement, you may want to check with the state department of taxation to learn which seniors owe benefit taxes. These rules may change between now and your retirement, so be sure to check on this every few years so you know what to expect.

If you don't want to deal with Social Security benefit taxes at all, you could consider retiring in one of the 37 states that don't tax seniors' Social Security benefits. But even if you do this, you could still owe federal taxes. The only way around these is to limit your taxable income. If that's not possible, you'll have to account for Social Security benefit taxes in your retirement plan.

3 SOCIAL SECURITY SECRETS FOR EVEN BIGGER CHECKS

2. Some places have a higher cost of living than others

Urban areas tend to have a higher cost of living than rural areas, so retirees living in cities will often have to save more to cover all their retirement expenses. Even among cities, though, there's a lot of variation in terms of cost.

If you plan to remain in your current city during retirement, you probably already have an idea of how much your expenses will be. But if you plan to move, it's a good idea to look at how the average cost of living in your chosen retirement city stacks up to the cost of living in your current city.

You should especially pay attention to the basics, like food and housing. But medical care should be high on your list, as well. People often see their healthcare expenses rise as they age, and this can take a significant bite out of your retirement savings.

THIS IS YOUR BIGGEST ENEMY WHEN SAVING FOR RETIREMENT

3. Staying put could save you money if you own your home outright

A monthly rent or mortgage payment can take up a significant portion of your budget, but it's not something all seniors have to deal with. Those who own their homes outright may find it's more affordable for them to remain where they are, rather than move elsewhere and take on a new housing payment.

Even if you owe money on your home, staying where you are could still be the right choice. This is especially true if housing costs have risen in your area since you first bought your home. If you try to move elsewhere, you might find that you're paying a lot more per month than you would have to if you remained in your current home.

But sometimes, moving could be the best decision. If you're downsizing, for example, you might end up with a more affordable monthly payment. Or if you sell your home for a sizable profit, you may be able to buy a more affordable home elsewhere and actually make a little money.

Ultimately, you have to base your decision on what you feel would make you the happiest in retirement. But once you've decided on that, make sure you've tailored your retirement budget to where you're going to be living. Things like cost of living and tax laws can change over time. So when you review your retirement plan annually, make sure you're reviewing these things, as well, to see if you need to make any adjustments."

Buffett has long said he believes Berkshire’s operating earnings are a better measure of the company’s performance because they exclude investment gains and losses, which can vary widely quarter to quarter.

WARREN BUFFETT'S BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY TAKES CITIGROUP STAKE

By that measure, Berkshire’s earnings were up significantly to $9.28 billion, or $6,312.49 per Class A share from last year’s $6.69 billion, or $4,399.92 per Class A share.

Analysts covering Berkshire expected the company to report operating earnings per Class A share of $4,741.64.

Berkshire said its revenue grew more than 10% to $76.2 billion in the quarter as many of its businesses increased prices.

Berkshire's many companies still performed well, suggesting the overall economy is weathering the pressure from inflation and rising interest rates.

It was a rough quarter for shares of three of Berkshire's biggest investments — Apple, American Express and Bank of America.

They all fell significantly during the second quarter, but rebounded during the third quarter, boosting the value of Berkshire’s portfolio since the end of the quarter.

Besides investments, Berkshire owns more than 90 companies outright. Berkshire said operating profits were up at all of its major units, including its insurance companies, major utilities and BNSF railroad.

BUFFETT'S BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY BUYS EVEN MORE OCCIDENTAL SHARES

Berkshire did report a $487 million pretax underwriting loss at Geico, which reported bigger auto claims losses because of the soaring value of vehicles and ongoing shortages of car parts.

Berkshire is often seen as a microcosm of the broader economy because its collection of manufacturing, retail, insurance, utility and service businesses touches so many different industries, and Berkshire’s profits tend to follow whatever the economy is doing.

Berkshire said it was sitting on $105.4 billion cash at the end of the quarter, which was little changed from the $106 billion it reported at the end of the first quarter.

Musk wants to know how many are ‘spam bots’ and how many are real people.

The billionaire CEO of Tesla agreed to buy Twitter in April for $44 billion, but has been trying to back out of the deal since July, accusing Twitter of misleading his team about the true size of its user base and other problems he said amounted to fraud and breach of contract.

Twitter sued him last month to complete the acquisition and Musk countersued.

The two sides are headed to a trial in October in a Delaware court.

""If Twitter simply provides their method of sampling 100 accounts and how they’re confirmed to be real, the deal should proceed on original terms,"" Musk tweeted early Saturday. ""However, if it turns out that their SEC filings are materially false, then it should not.""

Musk, who has more than 100 million Twitter followers, went on to challenge Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal to a ""public debate about the Twitter bot percentage.""

Twitter declined comment Saturday. The company has repeatedly disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission an estimate that fewer than 5% of user accounts are fake or spam, with a disclaimer that it could be higher. Musk waived his right to further due diligence when he signed the April merger agreement.

In details reported about Musk's countersuit, he is accusing Twitter of intentionally ""miscounting"" the number of spam accounts it hosts in order to juice its user metrics ""as part of its scheme to mislead investors about the company's prospects.""

He also claims that Twitter's reliance on the metric mDAU, or monetizable daily active Twitter users, as a basis of revenue is misleading in and of itself.

""But the historical significance of the piece, arguably the most important boxing award ever made available at public auction, is quite simply immeasurable.

FOX Business has reached out to Lemoine for comment but did not hear back before publication.

Lemoine appeared to reference his firing in a Saturday tweet, referring to a blog post he wrote in which he anticipated being fired for raising his concerns about AI ethics.

""Today I was placed on ‘paid administrative leave’ by Google in connection to an investigation of AI ethics concerns I was raising within the company,"" Lemoine wrote.

Google did not respond to FOX Business’ request for comment.

In a statement to the Big Technology Podcast, Google said all employees’ concerns about the company’s work are ""extensively"" reviewed, and found Lemoine’s claims about LaMDA being sentient ""wholly unfounded.""

Good luck with that. The Democrats can't walk away from $5 gas that easily.

And they can't walk away from the border crisis, or the debacle in Afghanistan, or the impending recession.

Comic book collectors will rejoice over Collect Forever's variant cover options, which Masherah likened to opening a trading card pack.
""If I'm a comic book collector, I want my comic books.
If I'm a trading card collector, I want my trading cards.""
We're launching with comic books; all the comic books are obtained directly from Marvel and DC – we're not touching anything in a secondary market.","For the first time since 2019, the Mecca for SciFi and Fantasy enthusiasts returns to San Diego for its first in-person convention since before the coronavirus pandemic - and in anticipation of the highly-anticipated four-day event beginning July 21, the famed global sports/entertainment trading card and collectibles company Upper Deck announced its newest initiative on Comic-Con Preview Night: the launch of ‘Collect Forever.’



""Our goal is to service collectors and help them collect the way they want to collect,"" Upper Deck President Jason Masherah told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview of the revolutionary expansion - which he said moves to bridge NFTs with tangible collectibles and includes a ""very natural extension"" into comic books given its established partnership with staples like Marvel.



""We wanted to create a space where people could essentially bring any collectible into this ecosystem and allow them to trade — and what's really cool as a collector is, you could now trade a Wayne Gretzky trading card for a Spider-Man comic book,"" the Upper Deck president said, noting the company's desire to extend to other collectibles outside the trading card realm.



Masherah introduced the world to Collect Forever at the multi-genre entertainment event Wednesday, adding that initial products to be available for purchase will include pre-ordered collectibles from Marvel, DC Comics, and Funko POP.



WONDER WOMAN COMIC DEBUT SOLD FOR $1.6M AT AUCTION



""We're much more than people realize,"" Masherah noted. ""We're typically known as a trading card company, but we have three distinct divisions of the company here. We have trading cards - which not only include sports trading cards but entertainment trading cards, which a lot of people don't realize; we have the autographed memorabilia, and then we have games. We make tabletop games, board games, and trading card games.""



As of Wednesday, the company will now add comic books to its repertoire.



Comic book collectors will rejoice over Collect Forever's variant cover options, which Masherah likened to opening a trading card pack.



""There's this phenomenon in the comic book world called variant covers; typically they're incentives for the comic book shops; if you buy 20 copies of a comic, you get a limited edition variant cover - and typically, the shop either has them designated for other customers, or they use them to try and make a profit in the shop,"" Masherah explained.



""We're actually randomly distributing those when people buy comics; so if you buy a $5 comic book, you have the opportunity to get a variant cover that might be worth $50 or $100. It's kind of like opening a trading card pack,"" Masherah said of the new offering.

""We're giving people access to things they might not have had access to before,"" Jason Masherah told Fox News Digital of Upper Deck's new launch, ‘Collect Forever’

Collect Forever, in addition to Upper Deck's e-Pack, will serve as a one-stop shop for collectors, bridging the benefits of an NFT with a true, tangible collectible and allowing consumers an opportunity to store their collectibles on an e-Pack account.



Masherah explained the setup allows collectors who may not have the physical space to store their entire collection of comic books, toys, figurines, etc., at home the ability to, instead, store them virtually (in physical vault-like storage facilities owned by Upper Deck).



He added that the expansion's objective targets not only those who lack the room to house their collectibles, but collectors who don't live in proximity to a brick and mortar:



""We also want to provide an online experience for people who maybe don't have a trading card or a comic book store close.

West Virginia announced last week it would bar five major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, from entering into banking contracts with the state treasurer's office or any state agency. Each of the five corporations had committed to policies limiting commercial engagement with the fossil fuel industry, which paid a whopping $769 million in taxes to West Virginia's state government.

""We're not going to pay for our own destruction, we're not going to subsidize that,"" West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore told FOX Business during an interview.

He noted that U.S. Bancorp backed off its prohibition of fossil fuel lending and was, as a result, kept off the state's restricted list of financial institutions.

Moore's action, a first-of-its-kind response to major banks' ESG push, is likely to be the start of many similar actions nationwide. At least 15 Republican-led states, which collectively manage tens of billions of dollars in public funds, have proposed laws or policies that would similarly punish anti-fossil fuel banks over the last year, according to a FOX Business analysis.

In addition to Texas, state financial officers in Kentucky, Oklahoma, Florida, South Carolina, Arizona, Louisiana, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas and North Dakota said they would take or consider action against banks that boycott energy companies. Kentucky and Oklahoma, like Texas, are compiling lists as required by recently passed state laws.

Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., unveiled a bill Wednesday seeking to force states to allow hydraulic fracturing by tying federal funds to the method of fossil fuel extraction.

States with statewide bans on fracking would be barred from receiving any funds from the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program under Tenney's legislation which was first obtained by FOX Business. The bill, which is set to be formally introduced Friday, is intended to target Tenney's home state of New York which first banned fracking in 2014 and codified the ban in 2020.

MANCHIN-SCHUMER BILL WOULD REINSTATE TAX ON IMPORTED OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

""New York State is sitting on top of natural gas formations that could power our state with clean energy for decades,"" Tenney told FOX Business in a statement. ""Unfortunately, far-left policies in Albany and Washington have severely limited our ability to safely tap into these reserves, threatening America’s energy independence, raising prices for consumers, and killing thousands of well-paying jobs.""

""As Americans struggle with record-high costs due to the Joe Biden and Kathy Hochul’s energy and economic illiteracy, it is time we take actions to reverse this disaster and restore our nation’s energy independence,"" she continued. ""Americans need clean energy at lower costs now, and delivering on this commitment can and should start right here in New York.""

The EECBG program, which is overseen by the Department of Energy, provides state and local governments grants to reduce fossil fuel emissions, reduce energy use and improve energy efficiency across various sectors. The program was appropriated $550 million under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which President Biden signed in November.

Tenney's office said the program is a ""perfect fit for being the enforcement mechanism of the law"" in a one-page summary of the bill shared with FOX Business.

GOP HAMMERS BIDEN FOR ALLOWING EMERGENCY OIL RESERVES TO GO TO CHINA: 'COMPROMISING OUR ENERGY SECURITY'

Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., issued a statewide ban on fracking in 2014 and, in 2020, introduced a bill codifying the ban into state law. The New York state legislature approved the bill as part of the fiscal year 2021 budget.

""New York's leadership on hydraulic fracturing protects the environment, our drinking water, and our health,"" Cuomo tweeted after he introduced the permanent ban in January 2020. ""We must make the ban permanent.""

New York is a net importer of natural gas, most which comes via pipeline from Pennsylvania, even though the Marcellus Shale, the nation's most prolific natural gas formation, runs through the western part of the state, according to the Energy Information Administration. In 2021, natural gas generated more than 45% of the New York's electricity, making it the largest source of statewide power by far.

Vermont, Washington and Maryland have also banned fracking. However, Vermont has no fossil energy reserves while Washington and Maryland have few reserves of their own.

The Washington-based conservative group Americans for Tax Reform says the tax ""will be paid by consumers in the form of higher gas and energy costs,"" Bloomberg reported.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced an agreement last week on legislation boosting taxes on huge corporations and wealthy individuals, bolstering fossil fuels and climate change efforts and curbing pharmaceutical prices. Overall, it would raise $739 billion over 10 years in revenue and spend $433 billion, leaving over $300 billion to modestly reduce federal deficits. But a Penn Wharton analysis found that the bill would probably increase inflation slightly for its first two years, before possibly reducing inflation later.

BIDEN'S RADICAL SEC AGENDA USES AGENCY TO MANDATE CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION

The tax on imported oil and petroleum products would seemingly break President Biden’s pledge that tax hikes will affect only those Americans earning $400,000 or more per year. Manchin has said the Democratic package honors that pledge. Taxes on oil and petroleum products are usually passed on to consumers in the form of higher energy prices. Energy prices have already broken records during Biden's presidency, and inflation has hit its highest rate in decades.

Manchin told ""The Faulkner Focus"" on Tuesday that an Inflation Reduction Act tax analysis which suggested the bill would raise taxes on nearly all Americans had been ""written by my friends on the Republican"" committee and not done by the whole Joint Committee on Taxation.

FOX Business reached out to JCT Chief of Staff Thomas A. Barthold who said the tax analysis was prepared ""by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.""

""The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation is a nonpartisan staff serving both sides of the Hill and both sides of the aisle. There is not a Republican staff. There is not a Democratic staff,"" he said.

A spokesperson for Manchin told FOX Business that Republicans on the Committee ""released a partial analysis of one portion of the bill to advance a partisan agenda that does not accurately reflect the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act on average Americans.""

SOARING INFLATION DRIVES MORE AMERICANS TO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK DESPITE 5.1% INCREASE IN WAGES

Manchin is one of Congress' most conservative and contrarian Democrats. He has spent over a year forcing his party to trim its economic proposals, citing inflation fears starkly, and his compromise with Schumer last week shocked colleagues who'd given up hope that he would agree to such a wide-ranging measure.

Manchin has asserted the bill's imposition of a 15% minimum tax on corporations earning over $1 billion annually is not a tax increase. He says it closes loopholes such companies use to escape paying the current 21% corporate tax.

Republicans mocked that reasoning and said its tax boosts would weaken the economy and kill jobs. They cited a report from Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that said about half of the corporate minimum tax would hit manufacturing firms.

""So in the middle of a supply chain crisis, Democrats want huge job-killing tax hikes that will disproportionately crush American manufacturing and manufacturing jobs,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Schumer said he expected votes to begin this week in the Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris could cast the tie-breaking vote to assure its passage.

Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa put the untitled 1982 painting up for sale, and an Asian telephone bidder represented by a Phillips representative based in Taipei won it after a four-minute competition.

The sale didn’t break the $110.5 million record for a Basquiat, held by an untitled blue work from 1982 that Maezawa won in 2017. Still, the red example sold by Phillips reaped a tidy profit for Maezawa, the mogul behind the e-commerce site Zozotown, who bought the red Basquiat six years earlier for $57.3 million. That represents a 48% return for the collector.

The Phillips auction continued the art market’s hot streak over two weeks of sales that has seen record prices for works like the ""Shot Sage Blue Marilyn"" and an iconic Man Ray photograph. Buoyed by the art market’s recent strength and Basquiat’s international appeal, Phillips headed into the sale with a measure of confidence, giving the work featuring a devilish figure a $70 million estimate.

The house hedged its bet, signing up an outside investor ahead of the sale to pledge to bid an undisclosed sum for it if no one else stepped up in the moment, guaranteeing the Basquiat would be sold.

PICASSO PAINTING FETCHES $67.5M AT AUCTION

Such financial mechanisms, called third-party guarantors, are increasingly common in the auction industry and in several cases helped larger rival Sotheby’s $409 million modern-art sale the night before. Sotheby’s sale amounted to the house’s third-largest single sale total ever. But its success hinged in part on selling several pieces by Pablo Picasso and others to guarantors who only had to place single bids to win.

Market watchers pay attention to the number of bidders who compete for works at the priciest levels because thin bidding can hint at potential cracks in collector confidence. On Wednesday, two bidders vied for the Basquiat—so that could indicate collectors still crave his work at a broad level. The work’s wall-spanning size may also have played a role in its appeal.

MARILYN MONROE'S DRESSES FROM POPULAR MOVIES UP FOR AUCTION

Increasingly, millennial collectors are starting to champion a fresh slate of artists born long after Basquiat died in 1988. These include Anna Weyant, whose 2021 ""Buffet II"" sold to a telephone bidder in Hong Kong for $730,800 over its $150,000 high estimate. Another auction newcomer this season, María Berrío’s 2013 ""Burrow of the Yellow,"" also sold for $998,000 over its estimate of $400,000 to $600,000.

The bill also imposes a 15% minimum tax on corporations based on profits they publicly report on their financial statements to shareholders.
The minimum book tax would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income.
The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.","The sweeping climate, health care and tax bill that Senate Democrats passed Sunday includes one of the biggest tax hikes in decades, including a new levy for corporations that repurchase their own stock.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which passed along party lines with Democrats employing the budget reconciliation process, would raise an estimated $739 billion over the next decade, with the revenues going toward initiatives designed to combat climate change and curb pharmaceutical prices, as well as efforts to reduce the nation's $30 trillion debt.

It includes about $433 billion in new spending, while roughly $300 billion of the new revenue raised would go toward paying down the nation's deficit.

Some of the main revenue raisers stem from new levies on wealthy businesses, including a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases that is poised to take effect in 2023. Democrats, who estimated this new levy will raise about $74 billion over the next decade, are hoping to slow companies' tendency to buy back their own stock from investors with the tax.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT: WHAT TAX HIKES ARE IN THE BILL?

Companies have been allowed to buy their own shares since 1982, and the practice has since become commonplace on Wall Street. In 2019, stock buybacks hit a record $1 trillion, according to the SEC. Buybacks already hit a record $281 billion in the first three months of 2022, according to S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt. Although they were down 17.4% in the second quarter.

""I hate stock buybacks,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""I think they are one of the most self-serving things that corporate America does.""

The bill also imposes a 15% minimum tax on corporations based on profits they publicly report on their financial statements to shareholders. The minimum book tax would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income. Democrats said the levy would affect around 200 of the country's largest corporations with profits exceeding $1 billion and that pay less than the current 21% rate for businesses.

Experts expect the two taxes to drag on 2023 earnings, with Goldman Sachs forecasting a 1.5% decline per share of S&P 500 companies. The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.

UBS strategists led by Solita Marcelli, meanwhile, projected the new taxes would have a ""very minimal 1% drag on S&P 500 earnings per share, although some companies will be more affected than others.""

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSA Feeding America food bank survey earlier this year showed that 80% of food banks were reporting either an increase or steady demand for emergency food services.","Inflation has been a ""concern"" for Los Angeles Regional Food Bank CEO Michael Flood, who stressed Tuesday that the price hikes for necessities, including food and gas, have ""put a lot of pressure"" on household budgets.

He also noted that the inflationary pressures have led to soaring demand at food banks.

""We’re worried,"" Flood told ""Varney & Co."" on Tuesday.

""We rely mostly on donated food from farmers, retailers, manufacturers and then we supplement that with food purchases and so being a nonprofit, it’s a matter of what resources are coming in, in terms of the amount of food, the amount of funding to supplement that food, so it’s a concern right now as we look between now and the end of the year, especially because of inflation.""

FOOD BANKS ARE SERVING MORE PEOPLE AGAIN AS INFLATION SQUEEZES BUDGETS

""It’s really put a lot of pressure on families and household budgets and it’s leading a lot of people needing to seek food assistance,"" he stressed.

Flood provided the insight the day before July’s inflation data will be released.

Last month, the Labor Department revealed that inflation accelerated more than expected to a new four-decade high in June, exacerbating a financial strain for millions of Americans.

The department said the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 9.1% in June from a year ago. Prices jumped 1.3% in the one-month period from May. Those figures were both far higher than the 8.8% headline figure and 1% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists.

The data marked the fastest pace of inflation since December 1981.

Price increases were extensive with energy prices rising 7.5% in June from the previous month and 41.6% compared to the same time last year. Gasoline, on average, costs 59.9% more than it did one year ago and 11.2% more than it did in May. The food index, meanwhile, climbed 1% in June, as consumers paid more for items like cereal, chicken, milk, and fresh vegetables.

Shelter costs – which account for roughly one-third of the CPI – sped up again in June, climbing 0.6%, matching an 18-year-high set in May. On an annual basis, shelter costs have climbed 5.6%, the fastest since February 1991.

Rent costs also surged in June, jumping 0.8% over the month, the largest monthly increase since April 1986. Rising rents are a concerning development because higher housing costs most directly and acutely affect household budgets.

Flood pointed out the shift in the trend he has been noticing as it pertains to the demographic visiting food banks.

He noted that during the pandemic ""we had so many people who were furloughed or lost their jobs and didn’t have employment.""

""Now the employment picture has improved when you compare it to 2020 and 2021, so now we’re seeing a lot of people who are working, sometimes two jobs, in the family or household, sometimes more,"" Flood said.

He stressed that even so, ""the high prices of food, of fuel, and housing in a place like Los Angeles and other metro areas puts a lot of pressure on budgets.""

With inflation at 40-year highs, many Americans are looking for aid for the first time and food banks are struggling to meet demand.

Charitable food distribution has exceeded any amounts given out before the COVID-19 pandemic, although there was some relief last year.

Distribution by California's Alameda County Community Food Bank has risen this summer and Texas' Houston Food Bank now gives out an average of 610,000 pounds.

In Southern California, the Los Angeles bank gave away around 30 million pounds of food during the first three months of this year, far more than the 22 million pounds passed out during the first quarter of 2020.

A spokesperson said that was up from 500,000 daily pounds before the pandemic.

Unplanned disruptions at LNG plants in the United States, Nigeria and Australia have wrong-footed traders, including BP and Shell, forcing them to pay inflated costs for alternative supplies.

In a market already struggling to meet global demand for natural gas after Russia sharply reduced pipeline supplies into Europe, the lost LNG cargoes which can be transported by ship, have pushed global prices sharply higher in recent months.

BP took a more than $500 million hit to replace LNG cargoes lost after a sudden shutdown of the Freeport LNG plant in Texas in June, industry sources told Reuters.

BREWERIES SCRAMBLE FOR CO2 AMID SHORTAGE: 'A SCARY SITUATION'

Freeport, the second-biggest U.S. LNG export plant, supplies BP with 4 million tonnes per year from a total portfolio of 18 million tonnes, BP Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss told Reuters.

""Freeport does create an impact in the quarter and we've provided for that for the year,"" Auchincloss said. The company had deducted the expected costs from its second-quarter profit, but Auchincloss did not specify costs.

A BP spokesperson declined to comment on the loss figure.

France's TotalEnergies also said it would replace eight cargoes of LNG it was scheduled to receive from Freeport by buying in the spot market in the third quarter of the year. It was unclear how much the replacement cargoes would cost TotalEnergies.

Freeport produces 15 million tonnes of LNG per year.

RUSSIA BANS INVESTORS FROM 'UNFRIENDLY COUNTRIES' FROM SELLING SHARES IN RUSSIAN ENERGY OR BANKING

Traders typically sign long-term offtake agreements with LNG producers and agree on separate deals to supply consumers with cargoes from their global portfolios. It's rare to use plant outages to justify not supplying consumers through what is known as force majeure.

Shell , the world's largest LNG trader with a 20% market share, cut its LNG production volumes in the second quarter by 4%, mainly due to supply losses from the Sakhalin-2 plant in Russia, where it exited operations after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February.

The company continues to receive LNG cargoes under existing long-term deals with Sakhalin-2, a company spokesperson said.

But the future of the contracts is shrouded in uncertainty after Russia gave foreign investors in the project one month to claim their stakes in a new entity that will replace the existing one. Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said it was ""highly unlikely"" Shell would join the new entity.

The supply loss impacted Shell's second-quarter profit by around $200 million in the quarter, according to estimates by industry sources. Shell declined to comment on the figure.

CRUDE OIL PRICES RISE AS RUSSIA SUSPENDS EXPORTS TO EUROPE THROUGH PIPELINE

On top of that, Shell and its partners lost LNG production at the giant Prelude floating LNG off the western coast of Australia after shutting it down amid a pay dispute.

Nigeria's huge LNG export terminal on Bonny Island has also seen output declines in recent months as a result of a shortfall in natural gas supplies due to rampant theft and sabotage to oil and gas pipelines.

The money lost is dwarfed by enormous profits both BP and Shell recorded this year on the back of soaring refining margins and high oil and gas prices.

But lower availability of LNG has pushed benchmark prices to record highs as Europe sought to ramp up imports rapidly to replace lost Russian pipeline natural gas.

At current prices, an average cargo of LNG would cost around $100 million in the spot market.

European LNG imports from January to July surpassed a record 100 billion cubic metres (bcm), or 75 million tonnes (Mt), almost reaching the level observed through the entire 2021, according to Nnenna Amobi, senior LNG analyst at Refinitiv.

Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

As a parent, you have two main options to help pay for your child’s college expenses: Parent PLUS Loans and private student loans .

The federal government offers Parent PLUS Loans and they come with unique benefits. Private loans come from private lenders, and they may have lower interest rates if you have good credit.

In this article, we’ll go over the main differences between the two types of loans to help you figure out which may be right for you.



Credible lets you compare private student loan rates from multiple lenders, all in one place.

Parent PLUS Loans vs. private parent loans

Both Parent PLUS Loans and private parent loans give you the opportunity to borrow money for your child’s higher education expenses. But they differ significantly in how interest rates are set and how you’ll repay them.

Parent PLUS Loans

The U.S. Department of Education offers Parent PLUS Loans, which are more formally known as Direct PLUS Loans. Graduate or professional students can take these loans out, as well as parents of undergraduate students.

You generally apply for these loans online through the StudentAid.gov website . In most cases, you won’t qualify if you have an adverse credit history, like a bankruptcy or foreclosure in the last five years or a history of late or missed payments.

Parent PLUS Loans have a fixed interest rate set by the federal government, which is currently 7.54%. That means the interest rate won’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You’re able to borrow up to the full cost of attendance, as determined by your child’s school, minus any other financial aid the student receives. When you take out the loan, you’ll also pay a fee of 4.228% of the loan amount. To pay the fee, the government will deduct a portion of the funds from each loan payout.

Private parent loans

Private parent student loans have no standard requirements. Instead, individual lenders set their own qualifications, interest rates, and repayment terms. But in general, lenders determine the interest rate based on your credit score. People with higher credit scores will qualify for lower rates, while people with poor credit will get higher rates, if they qualify.

You may find private parent loans with fixed or variable rates. Variable-rate loans typically begin with a lower APR, but this rate can rise over time. Fixed-rate loans don’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You usually have the option to make full principal and interest payments while your child is in school, or you can make interest-only payments to keep the interest from building up. Most private parent loans must be repaid within 15 years, though loan terms may be shorter depending on the lender.

The best private parent loans feature zero loan fees. Just like with Parent PLUS Loans, you’re solely responsible for repaying a private parent loan.

Cosigned student loans

A third option for helping your child pay for their college education is by cosigning their student loan. When you do this, your child is the primary borrower on the loan but you’re agreeing to be responsible for repaying the loan if your child defaults.

You may consider cosigning a private student loan with your child. In many cases, students aren’t able to qualify for a loan on their own since they may have little or no credit history. By cosigning, lenders take your credit into account as well. Any missed payments will hurt both your credit and your child’s. Many lenders offer a cosigner release option, which allows you to remove yourself from the loan once your child has made a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments.

A cosigner usually isn’t required on federal student loans.

When does it make sense to take out a Parent PLUS Loan?

A Parent PLUS Loan may make the most sense if you have fair credit. With these federal loans, the interest rate is the same no matter your credit score. If you don’t have any major credit problems, but your score simply isn’t the best, you may get a lower rate on a Parent PLUS Loan than you would on a private loan.

A Parent PLUS Loan may also be the best choice if you want to take advantage of one of the unique repayment plans the government offers:

Standard Repayment Plan — This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years.

This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years. Extended Repayment Plan — This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan.

This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan. Graduated Repayment Plan — This plan can help if you expect to have a higher income in the future. Your payments start low, but rise over time. Ideally, your income would grow along with your payment. You also have up to 10 years to repay your loan under this plan.

If your payments are still too high, you may have the option to combine all the Parent PLUS Loans you have into a federal Direct Consolidation Loan, which gives you the option of enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. With these plans, your monthly payment is capped at a certain percentage of your discretionary income. This can be a great option if your discretionary income is relatively low.

When does it make sense to take out a private parent student loan?

If your child has exhausted all their scholarship, grant, and federal loan options, and if you have excellent credit, a private parent student loan may make the most sense. You’ll likely be able to qualify for a lower rate than what you’d receive with a Parent PLUS Loan, saving you money in interest.

Private loans may also make sense if you’d like to choose a variable interest rate. This option gives you a lower initial rate, though it can rise over time. If you expect to pay off the loan quickly, though, you may be able to keep the lower interest rate and pay off the loan before it rises."

Nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, fell at 2.5% pace from a year ago. It also declined sharply in the second quarter at a 4.6% annualized rate, after having declined by an upwardly revised 7.4% in the first three months of the year, the report showed.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity would decline at a 4.7% rate in the April-June period.

Large shifts in the composition of the U.S. workforce in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have made it harder to measure underlying productivity growth, which some economists put at about 1.0% or less, making the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation more difficult.

19 of the company's models over the last seventeen years risk brake failure, according to a report filed in July with the National High Traffic Safety Administration. The report states that the vehicles are equipped with inefficient brake fluid reservoir caps that may not cause vent pressure efficiently. These faulty caps can create a vacuum ""that could potentially leak brake fluid, which may lead to partial or total loss of braking capability.""

Stocks in this Article ZG ZILLOW GROUP INC. $36.33 -2.65 (-6.80%)

The firm’s termination of its tech-enabled home-flipping business, known as ""iBuying,"" follows Zillow’s announcement about two weeks ago that it was halting all new home purchases for the rest of the year. At the time, Zillow pointed to labor and supply shortages for its inability to renovate and flip houses fast enough.

In a statement Tuesday, Chief Executive Rich Barton said Zillow had failed to predict the pace of home-price appreciation accurately, marking an end to a venture the company once said could generate $20 billion a year. Instead, the company said it now plans to cut 25% of its workforce.

ZILLOW STOCK DROPS AS COMPANY PUTS HOMEBUYING ON HOLD

""We’ve determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated and continuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility,"" Barton said.

Zillow and other tech-powered house flippers, known as iBuyers, purchase homes, renovate them and then try to sell them quickly, making money on transaction fees and home-price appreciation. Zillow used an algorithm to make home price estimates, called the ""Zestimate,"" and determine what it would pay home sellers.

Ultralow mortgage-interest rates and a need for more space to work from home have driven robust home-buying demand in the past year and a half. Prices have climbed sharply in almost every corner of the U.S.

""It feels like this would be a hard time to lose money buying and selling houses,"" said Benjamin Keys, professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ""This is a time frame where prices have gone up in a lot of places, dramatically.""

In recent months, sky-high prices have forced out some buyers, and the market has showed signs of cooling off, as many economists expected. The median existing-home sales price rose 13.3% in September from a year earlier—still unusually robust, though down from 23.6% year-over-year price growth in May, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Even this gradual tapering in price growth flummoxed Zillow’s algorithm, leading the company to pull the plug on the venture.

ZILLOW RIDES BOOMING REAL ESTATE MARKET TO 70% REVENUE GROWTH

Zillow’s class C share price was down 10% on Tuesday, falling before the company announced after the market closed that it would end home flipping. Shares continued to slide in after-hours trading.

The move represents a big hit to Zillow’s top line. Home-flipping was the company’s largest source of revenue, but it has never turned a profit.

Zillow, which released earnings Tuesday, said its home-flipping business, Zillow Offers, lost $381 million last quarter, as measured by adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That resulted in a combined adjusted Ebitda loss of $169 million across all of Zillow.

Zillow has an inventory of about 9,800 homes across the United States that it is currently shopping to investors. Additionally, there are another 8,200 homes in contract it has agreed to buy. The company expects to lose somewhere between 5% and 7% on these homes, the company said.

Starting in the summer, competitors such as OpenDoor and Offerpad began to pull back from home purchases in one of the biggest home-flipping markets, Phoenix, as the red-hot pandemic market began to cool.

But Zillow accelerated, according to an analysis of sales records by real-estate tech researcher Mike DelPrete, scholar-in-residence at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Zillow also paid significantly more than those competitors for each home it purchased, buying homes priced $65,000 above the median on average, according to DelPrete’s analysis.

By October, the company had listed 250 Phoenix homes at a median-price discount of 6.2% below what it had paid for them. DelPrete called Zillow’s price blunder a catastrophic failure.

A wider look at Zillow’s national performance by analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets found it had listed 66% of homes at prices below what it had paid for them, with an average discount of 4.5%.

""The fact that Zillow can’t make it work shouldn’t be the final death knell for iBuying,"" DelPrete said. ""The other companies are making improvements, and Zillow’s not. They’re still losing lots of money.""

Zillow said it expects that the wind-down of its home-flipping outfit will take several quarters."

FOX Business has learned that Bakish once again won’t be attending the investment bank’s annual ""summer camp for billionaires"" in Sun Valley, Idaho where the rich and famous in the world of the media and finance think big thoughts and at times lay the groundwork for potential big deals.

The event officially begins Tuesday, but the top media executives began flying into the tiny hamlet 155 miles east of Boise on Monday. The resort area will for a week house more billionaires than possibly anywhere in the country. This year’s event will feature some controversial figures in media and tech such as former Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos who just days ago stepped down from e-commerce giant Amazon amid intense regulatory pressure.

'GREASE,' 'GODFATHER' TO RETURN ON PARAMOUNT+ AS VIACOMCBS MOUNTS STREAMING CHALLENGE

The Bakish-Allen & Co. contretemps stem back to 2017 when Bakish butted heads with bankers at the firm over Viacom’s planned acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive. Bakish was CEO of the then standalone Viacom. Discovery ultimately won the bidding war for the $12 billion takeover, but Bakish complained to his board about Allen’s work on the deal and banished them from further assignments. Since then Bakish hasn’t attended the high-profile conference. His last appearance came in 2017.

This year's apparent snub is more glaring given Bakish’s clout in the media business. In 2019 Bakish was named head of the combined ViacomCBS that is controlled by the Redstone family’s parent company National Amusements, thus making him one of the most powerful executives in media.

Bakish’s standing, particularly among investment bankers, could grow even more if, as rumored, he shops ViacomCBS to suitors. Such a possibility makes his absence all the more conspicuous.

A spokesman for ViacomCBS had no comment and a spokesperson from Allen & Co. could not be reached.

The 2021 event comes after a one-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As in past years, tech, media, and finance royalty are on the attendee list such as Bakish’s boss, Shari Redstone, president of National Amusements.

Investment bankers say Redstone will be shopping for deals at the conference including a possible Comcast merger, which would face significant antitrust hurdles since such a deal would have the companies combining rival broadcast networks CBS and NBC, the latter of which is owned by Comcast. Currently Federal Communications Commission rules ""prohibit a merger between any two of the big four broadcast television networks.""

One former mainstay attendee who will not be part of the festivities is former CBS chief Les Moonves who was ousted from the company in 2018 amid sexual harassment allegations. Redstone butted heads with Moonves who resisted her plan to merge both Viacom and CBS, which had been separate units controlled by Redstone’s late father, Sumner Redstone who passed away in August 2020.

When Shari Redstone combined the two companies, she appointed Bakish CEO of ViacomCBS which now controls some of the most well-known brands in media such as Paramount Pictures, CBS News, Comedy Central and MTV.

WINNERS & LOSERS IN DISCOVERY'S MARRIAGE WITH AT&T'S WARNERMEDIA

Other attendees of the event will be David Zaslav, newly anointed CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery which recently spun out of AT&T in one of the most high-profile tie-ups of the year. Bezos, who relinquished his position as Amazon CEO on Monday to Andy Jassy. Both are expected to attend while they face serious pressures from regulators in the Biden administration who want to break up the company on the grounds that it’s a monopoly.

Amazon has been on the deal-making hunt as well recently with its acquisition of MGM Studios for $8.5 billion. Meanwhile, investors have been speculating that Amazon will split its stock when Bezos steps down to get retail investors interested in its shares which closed Friday at a whopping $3,510.

The e-commerce giant's stock has been pretty stagnant over the past year, only posting 8% returns year-to-date. Investors believe a stock split will help drive the stock price higher.

Aside from Bezos, other big names in attendance include Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Netflix’s Reed Hastings, Comcast’s Brian Roberts and WarnerMedia’s Chief Executive, Jason Kilar. Bill Gates is also said to be on the list following a tumultuous year for the Microsoft founder including a divorce and rumored ties with the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein.

Gates also stepped down from Microsoft’s board in March of 2020 amid an investigation that he had an affair years ago with a Microsoft employee. A spokesperson for Gates said the decision to step down from the board was unrelated to the affair, which ended amicably.

Deal talk already circulating at Sun Valley ranges from mega-media deals to smaller streaming takeovers. Aside from finding a possible suitor for ViacomCBS, Lionsgate, the independent movie and TV studio, has long been said to be an acquisition target. John Feltheimer, CEO of Lionsgate, will be one of the big names in attendance. Also reportedly being shopped around is NFL Network and possible suitors could include Fox Corp, the parent company of FOX Business Network, bankers say.

Another big theme investors are watching is the rise in popularity of the video gaming space. Since the start of the pandemic, the video gaming industry has exploded, now worth more than $180 billion. Heads of gaming companies like Activision Blizzard Entertainment and Epic Games are expected to be in attendance, possibly looking to strike up deals of their own."

The dispute involves around 5,000 parking spaces the city and bondholders agreed to give the Yankees as part of the development project – a complex, multi-year effort to bring economic growth to the poor South Bronx neighborhood Yankee Stadium calls home.

The development included a new stadium for New York City’s professional soccer team, New York City F.C., a hotel and retail stores on grounds that currently house parking lots and garages for Yankee games that the city is mandated to provide under a 2007 agreement with the team. It would be financed with private money arranged by a consortium that includes a housing developer and the owners of the soccer team.

BITCOIN, CRYPTO IN MLB NO LONGER OUT OF LEFT FIELD

Bonds issued in 2007 to build the parking facilities have fallen into default in recent years, while the parking garages owe the city millions of dollars in back taxes. The consortium also agreed to pay $50 million to restructure the defaulted debt.

For years, city officials and bondholders have said they were eager to find a solution to the Yankee parking imbroglio and until last week, all indications were that they had one.

But Yankee officials say the city and bondholders have reneged on a key piece of the deal that has put the entire project on hold indefinitely and possibly forever. That deal involved a guarantee of first-class parking for its fans even as the team agreed to reduce the city’s initial 9,000 plus parking space commitment.

A term sheet providing details of the agreement between bondholders, the city’s Economic Development Corporation (EDC) and the Yankees were reviewed by FOX Business.

""I’m very disappointed,"" said Yankee President Randy Levine, a former prosecutor and top city official under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani who was the architect of the redevelopment proposal. ""This would have gone a long way to salvaging the bonds plus we were going to spend a billion dollars in private money to revitalize this area that would produce thousands of good paying jobs.""

Levine added: ""The deal broke down over the bondholders and the city refusing to do what they agreed to do in the bond offerings and in the terms sheets.""

A spokeswoman for New York City's EDC said it was the Yankees who were backing out of promises made to get the deal done. She would not elaborate.

In a statement, EDC President Rachel Loeb said, ""After years of negotiations with the New York Yankees and other parties, we are disappointed they will not commit to promises already made to the city and the community and attempted to change key terms of the deal only days before a community board vote.""

A spokeswoman for Nuveen told Fox Business: ""Nuveen remains committed to the transaction set forth in the term sheet and looks forward to a continued strong relationship with the Yankees and the City.""

MLB OPENING DAY: GEORGE STEINBRENNER IV TALKS YANKEES BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS AMID COVID

The blowup of the agreement could have significant political repercussions for the next mayor of New York City, who will need to make economic redevelopment a top priority following the COVID-19 pandemic that saw businesses close amid strict city-wide lockdowns.

Bill de Blasio, the current mayor, is leaving office next year under mandated term limits. It’s expected that the winner of the recent Democratic primary either Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams or former New York City Sanitation Commissioner Kathyrn Garcia, will become the next mayor in the heavily Democratic city. Both are locked in a tight race and votes are still being counted.

The controversy surrounding parking for the Yankees has been a long-running problem that began with the construction of the new Yankee Stadium in 2006. Under a deal with the city, the Yankees are guaranteed 9,127 spaces by a non-profit that runs the garages, Bronx Parking Development Corp., documents show. Starting in 2007, the company issued more than $200 million in debt to construct garages and make other renovations to maintain ""first-class"" parking facilities for Yankee fans.

But the garages have fallen into disrepair and are anything but first-class these days. Many fans now take nearby suburban trains and city subways to travel to Yankee Stadium. The parking bonds have been in default for years and trade at distressed levels.

Management of the Yankees led by Levine, came up with a possible solution in 2018. Since the Yankees are part owners of NYCFC – a franchise with Major League Soccer – with the Abu Dhabi royal family, Levine cobbled together a proposal to finance the soccer stadium with private money on spaces now occupied by the Yankees parking. To get community buy-in, the Yankees teamed up with a developer to provide low-income housing, a new school and other amenities to the neighborhood.

The Yankees agreed to give up their rights to 9,127 spaces for something closer to 5,611 as long as the parking lot was maintained, the document shows. Bondholders' debt would be restructured as part of a new company.

Nuveen, which holds most of the bonds, would be the primary beneficiary of the $50 million payment.

The $1 billion project was expected to create thousands of jobs for a neighborhood that routinely ranks as among the nation’s poorest. All parties signed off on the term sheet which described the city’s and the bondholder's commitments to provide the roughly 5,000 parking spaces for the Yankees. The neighborhood’s community board was expected to vote on the measure this month.

But the Yankees say last week the deal was upended when the city’s EDC – the lead city agency handling the deal – and Nuveen balked at a parking space guarantee even at the reduced numbers that the Yankees wanted in the official contracts of the redevelopment.

Both are said to fear that such specific guarantees could open the entities to future litigation and that specific ""third-party beneficiary rights"" were never part of any deal. Yankees officials counter that all they were doing was codifying guarantees in the earlier agreement, and in the term sheet, albeit at a lower number of spaces.

City Economic Development officials tell FOX Business that they are still hopeful a deal can be worked out that satisfies both parties and that the community board can vote on the project sometime in the Fall.

But according to Levine, it appears the two sides are deadlocked over the semantics of what the city and the bondholders consider a guarantee. ""I tried to explain to them that the company emerging out of bankruptcy should guarantee these spots because that’s what the bond issuance was for—providing parking for Yankee Stadium and the community,"" Levine said. ""It made no sense to us why the city and the bondholders didn’t want to guarantee these spots. They just don’t want to guarantee what they agreed to in the past and that's provide Yankee fans and the community with parking."""

And the answer they’re getting is a resounding ""yes.""

FOX Business has learned that top c-suite officials from the big banks have been setting up meetings with the relatively new chairman of the SEC in recent weeks to get a better idea of his agenda as head of Wall Street’s top cop.

Gensler was nominated by Democratic President Biden for the post and was confirmed by the Senate in April. People who have met with him say he hasn't yet fully moved into his office at the commission's Washington, DC headquarters. They say he is still largely working from his home in nearby Baltimore.

FEDS ACCELERATING CRYPTO WORLD CRACKDOWN

From his home office, however, Gensler is plotting to be a ""transformational"" SEC chair, according to Wall Street executives who know him. His top priority, he has signaled to these people: significant changes in what corporations must disclose to the public that reflect certain political, environmental and social goals an increasing number of investors are demanding.

Gensler is also telling executives that he will not ignore the traditional parts of his job and will be looking to enhance protections for small investors who have flooded the market in recent years, embracing risky financial products on a scale not seen since the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.

""He's worried about small investors getting ripped off, but the highest priority will be the new disclosure rules that appeal to the environment and issues like that,"" said one c-suite executive who asked not to be named.

An SEC spokesman had no comment.

Gensler, well-known and mostly well regarded among the Wall Street elite given his long years as a banker at the prestigious investment house Goldman Sachs and later while serving in various government finance-related roles including chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under former President Obama.

SEC PICKS AS CORPORATE REGULATOR A PROFESSOR WHO CRITICIZED STARTUP ‘UNICORNS’

His politics have transformed over the years from a left-of-center liberal on financial issues to someone who now embraces progressive edicts from the likes of Democratic Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fierce critic of corporate America. Wall Street executives say Gensler is so close to Warren he often confers with her on policy issues. A spokesman for Warren didn't return a call for comment.

Gensler's political beliefs are said to be at the center of his new – and according to some observers radical agenda – as SEC chair. He wants to impose new disclosure rules sometime before the end of the year that will force companies to go beyond alerting investors about financial issues that can materially impact their holdings. That will mean corporations will have to disclose issues about their carbon footprint, board-room diversity and other non-financial issues. It's unclear what exactly Gensler will be asking in terms of these new disclosures, but Wall Street executives say he is telling people he and his staff will provide details by the fall.

The disclosures will certainly draw criticism from some corporate executives and GOP politicians who believe Gensler is overstepping his role as a regulator of markets by embracing progressive political issues.

But Gensler appears undeterred. ""He is really serious about this stuff that probably comes right from Elizabeth Warren’s office,"" said one attorney who deals with major corporations on their dealings with the SEC. The attorney said Gensler will pass the rules through a party-line vote since Democrats outnumber Republican commissioners 3-to-2.

Other issues Gensler will focus on are those he believes involve more typical Wall Street abuse of small investors. He's said to be worried that there's not enough disclosure when retail investors buy shares of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies or SPACs. This is a new way a company can go public by being acquired by a shell company that buys several different ventures. Gensler is worried that small investors who buy shares at initial public offering are getting crushed with fees that aren't levied on big investors who sponsored the product.

SEC MULLS GAMESTOP, AMC ‘GAMIFICATION’ CRACKDOWN WITH REGULATORY LAYER

One particular concern in the SPAC space for Gensler is the so-called celebrity SPAC where movie stars and professional athletes lend their names to the SPAC even though they have no investment expertise, these people add.

Also on his list, as previously reported by FOX Business, the issues of payment for order flow and the gamification of trading. Payment for order flow is the system that allows small investors to trade for free or at a low cost through discount brokerages. Brokers sell their order flow, or buy and sell orders, to other financial firms to match the orders. The financial firms make money on the bid-and-ask spread and by handling so many trades even fractions of a penny could add up to enormous profits.

The SEC chairman is worried the system gives financial firms matching the orders--like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial--an unfair information advantage in the markets. One option he has discussed: Forcing discount brokers to send more of their trades to public exchanges where there is more transparency.

Gensler appears to be still grappling with how to regulate the so-called gamification of trading, where discount brokers appear to lure unsophisticated investors to their platform through gimmicks and incentives without properly disclosing the risks involved in trading. Wall Street executives say clues to how Gensler will regulate gamification might be found in the upcoming IPO documents for trading app Robinhood, which has been in negotiations with the SEC about becoming a public company via its private filing.

Robinhood, which offers trading with no fees, is planning to come public later this summer; its IPO document known as an S-1 will be publicly released imminently."

""It’s not a one size fits all approach"", says Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors.

FOX Business has discussed the costs with Wall Street executives, analysts and think tank leaders, and while no exact estimate can be determined, the SEC’s new disclosure mandates involving everything from the environment to board diversity is likely to cost U.S. public companies well into the billions of dollars.

Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, known for his progressive leanings, has put at the top of the commission’s voting agenda new rules that will mandate disclosing information on so-called ESG or Environmental, Social, Governance issues. These issues involve a public company's commitment to alleviate climate change and other non-financial disclosures.

SEC PICKS AS CORPORATE REGULATOR A PROFESSOR WHO CRITICIZED STARTUP ‘UNICORNS’

Gensler met with President Biden and other top financial regulators on Monday to discuss climate-related financial risks and how regulators can push the president’s green and social agenda through edicts aimed at public companies. Gensler has said such disclosures are being demanded by a new breed of investor looking to make corporate America more socially responsible.

But critics such as business groups, and GOP lawmakers say the move by the SEC is part of a broader effort by the Biden administration to force companies to embrace a progressive social agenda. They also contend the commission is exceeding its authority that has traditionally focused on protecting small investors from financial fraud.

Gensler is forging ahead, however, and given the political makeup of the commission with Democrats outnumbering GOP commissioners by a 3-to-2 majority, he is likely to push through his new disclosure mandates possibly by the end of the year, say people with knowledge of the chairman’s thinking.

According to the proposed new disclosure standards, companies must ""ramp up disclosures regarding their climate change-related risks,"" and ""enhance (company) disclosures about the diversity of board members and nominees.""

SEC MULLS GAMESTOP, AMC ‘GAMIFICATION’ CRACKDOWN WITH REGULATORY LAYER

While there is a contentious debate about the need for such disclosures, one thing is certain: Companies will be spending significant sums of money on both lawyers and consultants on how best to disclose a corporation’s carbon footprint and the new diversity mandates.

For example, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, estimates that the new corporate disclosure rules will cost ""billions of dollars"", and possibly leading to lower shareholder returns. The group also warns of massive legal liabilities as progressive activists challenge the veracity of the corporate disclosures since the SEC rule, at least in its current proposed form, is amorphous and thus leaves room for various interpretations.

""It’s not a one size fits all approach"", says Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors. ""ESG reporting is so vague, there’s really no way to quantify it.""

An SEC spokesman declined to comment, but the woke disclosure rules have their support in certain areas of the financial business that has focused on ESG investing. Blackrock, the world’s largest money manager, is offering a slew of new ESG funds that screen for companies that meet ESG standards but also charge investors higher fees than other funds offered by the company.

Blackrock’s CEO, Larry Fink, has been an advocate of social investing and using Blackrock’s clout (it manages nearly $9 trillion) to push for these reforms at the companies it invests in. The firm recently voted to place on the board of oil giant ExxonMobil three activist shareholders from the ESG-centric fund, Engine No 1.

""I think spending billions (on these disclosures) is exaggerated,"" said Columbia law professor John Coffee, an expert in corporate governance matters. ""And as Engine No. 1 proved with Exxon, shareholders appear willing to vote for such goals.""

Some Wall Street analysts say the size of the costs for these disclosures could easily run into the billions of dollars as they spend money on consultants to prepare for the additional disclosure, plus in the case of banks, they may also be barred from doing business with companies that are deemed fully committed to the woke policies.

""Mandated disclosures could impact (banks) bottom line because they might be forced not to lend to companies and businesses that don't meet the ESG standards,"" said Dick Bove, an analyst at Odeon Capital.

Also, the costs will fall disproportionately on smaller public companies that don’t have the same cash on hand and the staff to deal with the new legal issues.

""This whole ESG thing is just one giant waste of time and money,"" added Whalen Global Advisors chief, Chris Whalen, ""It’s just a big show that only benefits the consultants and the lawyers who are making money off of this."""

Seven out of 18 categories tracked by Adobe in July — including electronics, jewelry, books, toys, computers, sporting goods and apparel — saw year-over-year price drops. However, 14 categories saw month-over-month price drops.

The price of all electronics, in particular, saw one of biggest drops in July, falling 9.3% compared to a year earlier. Prices of electronics also decreased 2% from June.

The cost for apparel fell 1% year-over-year for the second consecutive month and dropped 6.3% since June, according to the data. Meanwhile, the cost of toys also fell 8.2% year-over-year and 2.9% since June.

Wavering consumer confidence combined with a pullback in spending and oversupply for some retailers ""is driving prices down in major online categories like electronics and apparel,"" according to Patrick Brown, Adobe vice president of growth marketing and insights.

Regardless, it's providing some relief for consumers who are battling surging food costs online and in-store, Brown added.

Food costs was one category that hasn't let up. According to the data, prices for groceries jumped a record 13.4% compared to a year ago. That's the biggest increase of all 18 categories.

Throughout the entire month of July, consumers doled out $73.7 billion online, which is up 20% from a year ago. Prime Day, Amazon's highly anticipated 48-hour shopping holiday, drove record online sales for the entire industry last month, according to Adobe."

The problem stems from one of the nation's largest gas production hubs in Mississippi called the Jackson Dome. It's a natural source for CO2, and it's where many breweries get their supply from.

John Raquet, the Chairman and Founder of Gas World, a leading news outlet covering the gas industry, says the dome is still producing CO2, but has elevated levels of other hydrocarbons that do not meet food and beverage standards for use.

""It's causing a tightness in the market,"" Raquet said. ""I think it is a crisis at the moment when you have breweries telling their staff you're going to be laid off because we're not getting supplies until September or October.

Landry says if the CO2 does not meet beverage standards, it has the potential to create off flavors in their beer.

Policymakers approved two consecutive 75-basis point rate hikes in June and July and have suggested that another increase of that magnitude is on the table in September.

Businesses also struggled to onboard new employees, with nearly half of owners (49%) reporting that they could not fill open jobs. The Labor Department reported last week that there were 10.7 million open jobs at the end of June.

The department said the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 9.1% in June from a year ago. Prices jumped 1.3% in the one-month period from May. Those figures were both far higher than the 8.8% headline figure and 1% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists.

The data marked the fastest pace of inflation since December 1981.

Price increases were extensive with energy prices rising 7.5% in June from the previous month and up 41.6% from last year. Gasoline, on average, costs 59.9% more than it did one year ago and 11.2% more than it did in May. The food index, meanwhile, climbed 1% in June, as consumers paid more for items like cereal, chicken, milk and fresh vegetables.

Summer staples, including hotdogs, have been costing more as well. Hot dogs increased by more than 16% compared to the same time last year and ice cream rose more than 12%.

Because of this added protection, lenders often have lower credit score requirements for secured loans and may even approve borrowers with a bad credit score.","Our goal here at Credible Operations, Inc., NMLS Number 1681276, referred to as ""Credible"" below, is to give you the tools and confidence you need to improve your finances. Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

Getting a personal loan can be difficult if you have a limited credit history or bad credit. Some lenders that target bad credit borrowers promise no credit check and fast funding. But these loans often come with expensive fees that can trap you in a cycle of debt.

If you’re struggling to choose the right personal loan — or finding it flat-out impossible — you may start to feel discouraged. Before you settle for an expensive loan product, though, here are some bad credit loans that you should avoid — whether you just need a few hundred dollars, want a $10,000 loan , or anything in between.



Credible makes it easy to see your prequalified personal loan rates from various lenders, all in one place.

1. Payday loans

A payday loan is a small, short-term loan intended to tide you over with an advance until your next payday. Storefront payday lenders typically offer these loans, but you may also find them online. Depending on your state, there may also be a maximum borrowing limit, often $500 or less. Lenders usually require borrowers to repay these loans in two to four weeks’ time, in one lump sum, plus fees.

If you’re struggling to make ends meet before your paycheck hits, this can seem like an enticing loan option, especially if you need same-day funds .

Why you should avoid them: Most payday loan lenders don’t have strict credit- or income-based qualifications, so they often loan money to people who may struggle to repay the debt . Additionally, these loans are notoriously expensive. While most states cap the interest that can be charged per $100 borrowed, this is usually in the range of $10 to $30.

While that may not sound like too much, when you consider the length of the loan term and the low borrowing limits, these fees work out to an astronomical APR. For example, a $100 payday loan with a two-week repayment term and a $15 fee equates to an APR of nearly 400%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

Compare that to the average interest rate on a 24-month personal loan — 8.73% in May 2022, according to the Federal Reserve — and it’s easy to see what a ""deal"" payday loans really work out to be.

2. Cash advance loans

A cash advance loan is similar to a payday loan, in that you can use its short-term funds to help you cover immediate or unexpected expenses. These loans can even be funded as quickly as the same day, depending on the lender.

Cash advance loans differ from payday loans in some important ways, though. For starters, you can usually borrow a lot more with a cash advance loan, with some lenders offering as much as $5,000. You don’t always have to repay a cash advance loan in just a few weeks, either; you may be able to take out a cash advance that you can repay in monthly installments.

Why you should avoid them: Cash advance loans are still significantly more expensive than traditional personal loans, or even credit cards. Depending on the lender, your cash advance loan could have an APR of 299% or more.

3. Car title loans

If you have bad credit and need to borrow money, using your vehicle as collateral to get a car title loan could be one option. But car title loans aren’t a good choice for most borrowers.

Title loans often have repayment terms as short as 30 days, though you might find installment options as long as 24 months. The amount you can borrow depends on your location, as well as the value of your vehicle — as long as you own your vehicle free and clear.

Why you should avoid them: The downside? You probably already guessed it: You’ll pay significantly more in interest with a title loan than with a traditional personal loan. It’s not uncommon for car title loans to have APRs in the triple digits.

More than that, though, you’re securing the loan with one of your most important assets: your car. If you were to default on your title loan, the lender could take ownership of your vehicle.

4. Pawn shop loans

A pawn shop loan is a short-term loan that’s secured by something you own, such as jewelry or other valuables. These loans typically allow you to access money quickly, depending on how much your valuables are worth.

Pawn shop lenders typically don’t run a credit check, so these loans can seem like a good option for borrowers with poor credit or those looking for a no-credit-check loan . The pawn shop will usually offer a percentage of the pawned item’s value in loan form. You’ll need to repay the loan by an agreed-upon date, or the shop keeps the item.

Why you should avoid them: If you repay the loan as agreed, you can get your valuables back. But your pawn shop loan will have accrued interest in the interim, which you’ll also need to pay. These loans also tend to have a variety of fees tacked on, such as storage, setup, and even appraisal fees. For this reason, a lower interest rate can be deceptive, as the loan will actually end up costing you considerably more in the end.

Try a personal loan instead

If you need funds for an unexpected expense, large purchase, or even to refinance high-interest debt, a traditional personal loan is often your best bet — even if you have bad credit. Here are some things you can do to increase your chances of qualifying for one:

Apply with a cosigner. Adding a cosigner with good credit to your personal loan application may be the answer to getting approved or snagging better interest rates. Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit.

Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit. Check your credit reports. If your low credit score is keeping you from getting a personal loan, it’s important to understand why. Check your credit reports to see what sort of negative items are bringing down your score. In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected.

In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected. Consider a secured personal loan. A secured loan uses one or more of your assets as collateral for the debt. Because of this added protection, lenders often have lower credit score requirements for secured loans and may even approve borrowers with a bad credit score. Some financial institutions might not even require a minimum credit score at all, as long as you’re securing the loan with an asset. But keep in mind that if you fall behind on your loan payments, the lender can take your collateral."

WHAT IS CASH-OUT REFINANCING AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

How mortgage rates have changed over time

Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac — 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates.

If you’re ready to take advantage of current mortgage refinance rates that are below average historical lows, you can use Credible to check rates from multiple lenders .

How to get your lowest mortgage refinance rate

If you’re interested in refinancing your mortgage, improving your credit score and paying down any other debt could secure you a lower rate . It’s also a good idea to compare rates from different lenders if you're hoping to refinance so you can find the best rate for your situation.

When is it worth it to refinance?

Refinancing a mortgage can be a great way to save money. But it’s not always the best move for every homeowner.

People refinance for a number of reasons, including to get a lower interest rate, change their monthly payment amount and lower their interest costs. Generally, if you can lower your interest rate by at least 0.75%, refinancing might be a good move.

But before you refinance, be sure to weigh closing costs, and calculate how long it will take before your savings from the refinance cover the expenses of refinancing.

What is a good mortgage rate?

Generally, a good mortgage rate is one that’s the lowest you can qualify for based on your individual factors, such as credit history, income, other debts, down payment amount, and more.

A rate that’s good for your financial situation should result in a monthly mortgage payment that you can manage, while leaving plenty of room in your monthly budget to put toward savings, investments, and an emergency fund. And a good rate should be competitive with average rates in the geographic area where you’re looking to buy.

BNPL INCLUSION IN CREDIT REPORTS CAUSES GROWING CONSUMER CONCERNS, SURVEY CLAIMS

Americans coping with rising prices

Inflation is currently surging and increased in June to a new 40-year high, marking the fifth time it's broken that record this year. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 9.1% annually in June, hitting its highest point since November 1981, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

Because of this, many consumers are needing to dip into their savings or fund their purchases with credit, according to data from Morning Consult Economic Intelligence . Intentions to buy big-ticket items such as electronics, trips and vacations, home appliances and furniture have all decreased over the past year.

But despite these setbacks, consumer balance sheets are historically strong, according to Morning Consult. Net wealth as a share of disposable income is currently near a record high as household debt as a share of total assets is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, according to data from the Federal Reserve.

Because of this, some consumers, especially from higher-income households, are actually increasing their spending and expected spending, according to the Morning Consult report. Households with an annual income of at least $50,000 reported a 25% increase in monthly spending from May 2021 to May 2022.

""To put it simply: People still have the means to buy things, but they are expecting items to cost more,"" the report stated. ""And Morning Consult data indicates that they’re using BNPL to pay for some of them. The consistency with which U.S. consumers have used BNPL to fund their purchases throughout 2022 indicates that the payment form may be helping to keep their price sensitivity and substitutions at bay, and should be viewed as an indicator of the staying power of BNPL.""

If you have used BNPL to pay for your purchases and want to pay it down, consider using a personal loan to help pay your debt. Visit Credible to compare multiple lenders at once and choose the one with the best interest rate for you.

APPLE’S CONSUMER DATA PROVIDES 'COMPETITIVE EDGE' FOR BNPL, EXPERT SAYS

Americans continue to use BNPL options for purchases

The use of BNPL payments is not slowing, and the share of adults who used BNPL to fund a purchase at least once in the past month has not dropped below 16% in 2022, according to Morning Consult’s report.

Adults with annual income between $50,000 and $99,999 as well as those with an annual income of $100,000 or more are even more likely to have used BNPL for a purchase over the past month at 21% and 20%, respectively.

And consumers expect to continue using BNPL.

""As more retailers partner with BNPL providers and more payment providers create their own BNPL offerings, adoption and strong usage will likely continue,"" the report stated.

Even as consumers purchase less big ticket items, they will continue to use BNPL for a wide variety of other purchases. Morning Consult’s report showed 35% of respondents used BNPL to purchase apparel, 32% used it to purchase electronics and 23% used it for footwear.

The home, which was built in 1937, was originally designed for the actress and her then-boyfriend, conductor Leopold Stokowski, the conductor for Disney’s ""Fantasia."" It’s now listed by Mark Mintz at Compass.

The property, which sits atop a hill in the Beverly Crest neighborhood, has six bedrooms and six bathrooms. It features sprawling 180-degree views spanning from downtown Los Angeles to the ocean and includes a spacious deck, lush lawns and an infinity pool. The space, which was fully renovated in 2006 by celebrated designer Nicole Sassaman, highlights open living areas, sliding glass doors, rich woods and stonework throughout.

NYC APARTMENT OF HOLLYWOOD LEGEND GRETA GARBO HITS MARKET FOR $7.25M: ‘CINEMATIC VIEWS'

The Oscar-nominated star, who was fiercely protective of her privacy, saw to it that the home kept her out of the public eye. In her lifetime, Garbo famously said, ""I just want to be left alone."" The original small windows, along with the towering exterior walls, provided a space for Garbo to leisurely roam and sunbathe in seclusion. The courtyard, which was enclosed by high walls, was well beyond the reach of photographers. It became a hot spot for Hollywood's elite to gather.

Garbo and Stokowski ultimately called it quits, and he went on to marry heiress Gloria Vanderbilt in 1945. Garbo kept the house, and it was eventually occupied by several tenants, including singer/actor Tab Hunter. A Russian filmmaker, who is the current homeowner, loved the home’s history so much that he bought it under ""Greta Garbo LLC.""

After earning three Academy Award nominations, Garbo retired at age 35 and moved to New York City, where she became a known recluse. Garbo passed away in 1990 at age 84.

Sassaman, who was also captivated by the home’s history, spent nearly two years remodeling the space, which was transformed into ""a modern marvel,"" Elle Decor reported. She doubled the living space by erecting a second story.

""The hilltop view was stunning, but the estate didn’t take advantage of it because the house had been built to keep the inhabitants in and the press out,"" Sassaman told the outlet. ""We added as much glass as city code would permit, and this tactic transformed the home from dark and secluded to open and airy.""

Sassaman also made changes to the layout of the home to enhance its charm. A patio was converted into a living room with panoramic views of both the city and the infinity pool. Garbo’s bedroom became a home office, and the primary suite was installed on the newly constructed second floor. Another outdoor patio was enclosed and added to the kitchen, which provided more space to cook, dine and entertain.

The lower bedroom and bath, previously a guest room during Hunter’s residency, became a gym. Each space in the property was specifically tweaked by Sassaman to ensure a view.

""I worked to meld the worlds of yesterday and today together,"" she said.

The curved fireplace in Garbo’s original master bedroom was retained, as was the home’s sinuous exterior. Sassaman said she also kept the home’s unusual lines to stay true to Garbo’s time.

""The first time I saw the house, I couldn't believe that it had been sitting in such a poor state for so long,"" said Sassaman. ""But I immediately saw how the home could be turned into something really special if I just let its glamorous past guide the renovation.""

Sassaman told the outlet that she stayed at the estate while building the pool and retaining wall in the backyard. She admitted it was easy to fall in love with it.

He deserves to see his dream come true and I’m going to do it for him.
Siegel: That’s a good example.","Jackie Siegel is determined to finish building the largest single-family home in America – no matter the cost.

The Florida mom and her family, whose lives were the subject of the 2012 documentary ""The Queen of Versailles,"" is back for the Discovery+ docuseries ""The Queen of Versailles Reigns Again."" The show explores the challenges the 56-year-old and her husband David Siegel have endured in finishing the construction of their home, a project that has been more than 20 years in the making.

The 90,000-square-foot mega-mansion, inspired by the Versailles palace in France, features six kitchens, a 35-car garage, a 150-person dining room, a grand ballroom with gemstone-encrusted floors and a British pub. Siegel also has big dreams to have a Benihana hibachi grill installed and an aviary with toucans and flamingos. When done, the mother of eight suspects the home could be worth $200 million.

The Siegels have faced numerous obstacles over the years. After buying the land for the home in 2000, construction was halted during an economic downturn that impacted patriarch David Siegel, founder of Orlando-based Westgates Resorts. The family also endured a personal tragedy when their 18-year-old daughter, Victoria Siegel, passed away in 2015 from an overdose of methadone and antidepressants.

JILL ZARIN HEADS BACK TO 'HOUSEWIVES' AFTER BUILDING BUSINESS EMPIRE: 'IT WAS LIKE I NEVER LEFT'

Today, Siegel is feeling hopeful about the future of her family – and home. And she’s inviting cameras to follow her along for the ride. Siegel spoke to FOX Business about when the home will finally be completed, how she coped with the public scrutiny following her daughter’s death and the challenges she’s currently facing.

FOX Business: What compelled you to share your story in ""Queen of Versailles Reigns Again""?

Jackie Siegel: It’s been a rough road since the original documentary came out. A lot of offers came to us over the years, but we were very wary of how we were going to be portrayed. And then we lost our daughter. My world just crumbled down from there. It felt like nothing mattered anymore. I felt such sadness. I had lost my passion to do anything. It was a sad, dark time in my life.

But then, my husband and I started our foundation because we felt we could make a difference. We felt we were in a position to help others. I felt ready. When we were approached this time around, I felt the timing was right. The foundation had become a big part of our lives… And the truth is, everywhere I go, people always approach me and ask me the same question – whatever happened to the house? So this is my answer. It covers everything people have been wanting to know.

FOX Business: The show chronicles the challenges of building a house as large as yours. Why continue to create the largest single-family home in the country?

Siegel: The thing is we’ve already got over $50 million into the house. No one is going to buy it as is. And it’s my husband’s passion. We’re not getting any younger and our kids are growing up. I want to do this for him. And the house certainly has the queen’s touch. I want to live here as a family and the structure is already there. Right now we live on a private island in the middle of the lake that we bought in the meantime. Had we gotten this property first, we probably wouldn’t have built this other house. But it’s already under construction.

Also, my kids are getting involved. They’re really excited about this project. I’m also thinking about the possibilities. I’m going to have a grand ballroom that could hold 500 people. I could do a lot of events there to raise awareness and save lives from the drug epidemic. I can use the house to gain the attention that we need to raise awareness. I could host fundraisers, do a retreat or just invite people for a charity event where I can educate them. It will also be good for our kids, our grandkids and loved ones. We already have the home and own it. Why not see it through? I've got to find a way.

FOX Business: When do you believe the house will finally be finished?

Siegel: My goal is to have the house finished by May 3, 2023. That’s my husband’s 80th birthday. He almost missed his birthday last year because he was getting back surgery and was at the hospital. He caught pneumonia and at his age, that’s really scary. He deserves to see his dream come true and I’m going to do it for him.

FOX Business: What do you believe has been the biggest challenge you’ve faced recently in getting the house completed?

Siegel: The biggest problem is that there’s more than one problem *laughs*. The house was dormant for many years and wasn’t maintained. So I have issues with the natural aging of the house. The marble was falling off the exterior, and other areas were exposed and rusty. I had to structurally fix a lot of things, which I wasn’t anticipating. So it’s almost like it was under renovation at the same time we're constructing it.

We had to knock down walls and things like that because I’m redesigning the kids’ bedrooms. They no longer need a nanny’s room connected to their room. They rather have a large closet. And with the COVID pandemic, a lot of things slowed down in terms of the supply chain. For example, the floor of my grand ballroom is going to be made with semi-precious stones. These are beautiful stones from 22 different countries all over the world. And then we had to ship them to Indonesia. I went to Indonesia to check on the floor and do some quality control, which I’m glad I did because we still had to make changes.

There’s so much to oversee. Like the library, it’s going to have one of the most ornate wooden floors you’ve ever seen. We’re going to have an artist create something for us and this is his last project before he retires. He’s out in the country outside of Paris making our floor for us. We have to come up with the design for everything – and everything is a piece of art. This is more than a home. This is a palace.

FOX Business: Your home is even going to have a British pub among its many features. Did you originally have an idea for something that just didn’t work out?

Siegel: I needed a larger closet… but I couldn’t have two stories. I want to have a closet with an elevator so I can go up or down from my house. That’s a challenge. I originally wanted to find a way to connect the house to the island where you can do some zip-lining. But there are lots of high restrictions and things need to be approved. There are code issues as well. But if the sprinklers go off, for example, the artwork would be ruined. I had to put a fireproof stairwell that’s so ugly and takes up space, but it was necessary.

FOX Business: A big dream of yours, among many, is to have a Benihana built inside the home. How’s that going?

Siegel: That’s a good example. We have to take it out… But my husband really wants it. And our family is so picky when it comes to food, but one thing they all love is Benihana. They will all show up for that. We can all sit at the table together and everybody’s happy *laughs*. That’s the main reason he wants it.

FOX Business: What’s a misconception you feel the press or the public still has about you?

Siegel: … People that I’ve never met, of course, think that I married for money. But then when they see me, they’re the first ones to go, ""Oh my God, we love you."" *laughs*. My life isn’t about flashing money around and showing off. We’re doing all of this for us. We’re private people, except our story is exposed to the media.

BETHENNY FRANKEL REFLECTS ON HER BUSINESS EMPIRE, SKINNYGIRL'S FUTURE: 'I LIKE THAT BLOOD, SWEAT, TEARS'

… But the truth is, my family and our future come first. I’m still a small hometown girl at heart. My boys told me, ""Since we’re building a house like this one, we should really have a family crest."" If you would have asked me what a family crest was, I would pull out a tube of toothpaste! I’ve always been the same.

FOX Business: What kept you going after losing your daughter?

Siegel: … It was difficult, losing your child and then having the headlines bash family… Meanwhile, you’re mourning and wondering, ""What did I do wrong?"" But you can’t live with guilt your whole life. And those newspapers actually did us a favor because they pushed me and gave me the strength to speak about our experience publicly so that other parents are spared from going through a similar pain.

This notoriety puts me in a position where my voice can be heard. And it helps me to know that my daughter didn’t die in vain, that her story is, in some way, saving so many other lives. That so many people are learning about the impact of the opioid crisis. It helps with my healing process."

John McGraw, former chairman of McGraw-Hill Publishing, and his wife, Marjorie, were the first to purchase the property from the Garbo estate in 2017 for $8.5 million.

The McGraws took it upon themselves to renovate areas of the home, such as the kitchen and dining room, while preserving much of the home's Garbo-fashioned elements and spaces.

""This home is for the discerning buyer who is seeking dramatic, cinematic river and city views and the elegance that defined Garbo.""

Listing agent Brian Lewis of Compass Real Estate disclosed in an interview with Fox News Digital that the McGraws are choosing to sell the apartment now that they're spending a majority of their time away with family.

They would rather the home be enjoyed by ""someone who can really be there.""

The unit is based in The Campanile at the end of a cul-de-sac on 52nd St. It offers panoramic views of the East River and of the Queensboro Bridge.

Co-listing agent Will Kerr with Corcoran Real Estate detailed on a call with Fox News Digital that the 1927 pre-war building — pre-dating Manhattan's FDR Drive — has a ""beautiful"" venetian-style facade and exudes a ""real energy and calmness.""

""The level that you sit on the river, the relationship between the sky and the water is supreme,"" he added. ""There’s a really nice energy and relevance. It's timeless.""

The Compass real estate professional pointed out that Garbo’s bedroom still features custom elements that the movie star herself designed, including the wallpaper, the rugs and woodwork made out of wood shipped from Sweden.

The Swedish-born actress, who starred in classic ‘20s and ‘30s films like ""Mata Hari"" and ""Grand Hotel,"" first purchased the fifth-floor, luxury unit in 1954. She lived there until her death in 1990.

It’s been said the star chose this home because the boats passing on the river reminded her of her native Stockholm.

Since then, the home has been modernized with amenities such as an HVAC system, a gas fireplace and the McGraws' renovated kitchen and dining spaces.

FOX Business: Marilyn passed away 60 years ago.
FOX Business: How difficult is it to find and buy authentic Marilyn memorabilia today?
And it’s not only with Marilyn items.","Marilyn Monroe’s market value is still shining brightly 60 years after her death.

The Hollywood actress, also known as America’s most famous sex symbol, died in August 1962 at age 36. According to reports, the star had a net worth of $800K at the time of her death, which is nearly $8 million in today's money.

Monroe’s net worth in 2022 is a reported $10 million. In 2020, she ranked No. 13 on Forbes’ list of highest-paid dead celebrities due to her image and name being used by nearly 100 brands globally. A fictionalized version of the star is the subject of an upcoming Netflix film, ""Blonde,"" which has received an NC-17 rating.

Scott Fortner, a lifelong fan, is determined to keep Monroe’s legacy alive by preserving some of her most prized possessions. Fortner, who is considered an authority on Monroe, assists major auction companies in authenticating and verifying memorabilia.

REMEMBERING MARILYN MONROE, ACTRESS, FASHION ICON, AND SEX SYMBOL 60 YEARS AFTER HER DEATH

He owns the world’s largest private collection of Monroe’s personal property and archives, which he shares on both his website and social media.

This year, he’ll be celebrating her life at several events at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California.

Fortner spoke to FOX Business about how he became a sought-after collector and why Monroe is more valuable than ever and offered his advice for fans eager to obtain an authentic piece of history.

FOX Business: How did you end up becoming a Marilyn Monroe memorabilia collector?

Scott Fortner: Like anyone, you’re just taken by someone or find yourself very interested in a particular figure. That’s what happened to me when I was probably 12 or 13. I was really fascinated by Marilyn Monroe. I started collecting books and magazines as I read and learned more about her. This continued through adulthood.

Then, in 1999, her entire estate was put up for auction at Christie’s in New York. That auction really set the stage for celebrity auctions. I acquired the catalog from the auction, which became another book for my collection. But then I started to see some items from the 1999 sale that were being resold online on eBay and at other auction houses.

I thought to myself, ""Why am I collecting books and magazines when I could be collecting items that Marilyn owned?"" That’s how it started over two decades ago. … This isn’t an organization or a company investing in these items for business purposes or other concepts. I just happen to be a fan who’s lucky enough to collect.

FOX Business: Do your items ever get loaned out to museums or is it strictly private?

Fortner: As someone lucky enough to obtain these items, I feel a bit of an obligation and a duty to share them with the rest of the world and give other fans an opportunity to see Marilyn through her objects in the same way that I do.

I loan my collection for exhibitions. It’s been on exhibit around the world. I’ve often participated in opportunities to raise money for charitable causes. For example, some items have been on display to raise money for the actual orphanage where Marilyn lived as a child, which is still in business today.

FOX Business: What’s your process like in finding authentic memorabilia?

Fortner: When I first started, I didn’t know much about the auction business as we know it today. Over the years, I’ve come to learn more about the auction industry. I’m now connected with most of the major auction companies around the world, such as Christie’s, Julien’s Auctions and Heritage. Those are your top auction companies for entertainment memorabilia.

I’m also pretty well known in the collecting community. A lot of times people will reach out to me privately to see if I might be interested in purchasing something that they may have. I believe networking and learning are really important if you want to expand your collection. And I’m always looking for the next thing to add to my collection.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

FOX Business: How many items do you currently own?

Fortner: I don’t have an exact number anymore. I stopped counting. But it’s in the several hundreds.

FOX Business: What would you say is your crown jewel?

Fortner: The item that I get asked the most about is Marilyn’s personal Pucci blouse. During the last few years of her life, she wore Pucci quite a lot. It was an Italian designer that she discovered, which shifted her look away from the ‘50s, such as the tight skirts and sweaters. It was a more modern, easier look. She had several Pucci items in her closet. She was also buried in a green Pucci dress. So the brand has become synonymous with Marilyn.

The blouse I own happens to be the blouse she was wearing in the photos taken on the weekend before she passed away, the last photos ever taken of her alive. It’s the item I get frequently asked about in terms of selling. It’s not for sale. I’m a collector, not a dealer.

The most recent item I’ve added to my collection is something I’ve wanted for quite some time. It’s a pair of Marilyn’s Ferragamo high heels. The white Ferragamo high heel was a go-to look for her. There are countless photos of Marilyn wearing them throughout the ‘50s and ‘60s. It’s a new staple in my collection that I added just last month.

MARILYN MONROE’S FIGURE-HUGGING GOWN BECOMES TOP SELLER AT AUCTION: SHE’S ‘STILL TURNING HEADS TO THIS DAY’

FOX Business: Which item was the hardest for you to obtain?

Fortner: Marilyn attended a benefit for the Actor’s Studio. She was an usherette. People would come into the theater, and Marilyn would escort them to their seats and hand them a program. I’m sure that must have been quite the experience to be escorted by Marilyn. She wore an ensemble that consisted of an evening dress and a matching cape. That item came up for auction several years ago. I bid on the item and was told that I had won. It turned out that it didn’t make the minimum bid or the reserve.

A lot of times, a seller will say, ""If it doesn’t reach this certain amount, I’m not going to sell the item."" I found out after the auction and I went through the grueling process of attempting to negotiate with the seller. I bought it privately after the fact. It took several months for that to happen. But I was fortunate because it’s probably one of Marilyn’s most well-known public events. Now I have that cape as part of my collection.

FOX Business: Marilyn passed away 60 years ago. Why do you believe she’s more valuable than ever?

Fortner: For starters, she’s an icon. And I think people relate to her in so many ways today. Some people just enjoy her photos. Others enjoy her films. Some people relate to the personal struggles that she endured throughout her life. What I often find is that people feel a connection to her. There’s a sense of wanting to protect her. I think her appeal is very broad. And it’s not just in the United States — it’s worldwide. I’ve connected with other collectors and fans around the world, so her reach is very extensive and long-lasting. She’s an icon of beauty, for fashion and a legend of the silver screen.

FOX Business: How difficult is it to find and buy authentic Marilyn memorabilia today?

Fortner: What I’m seeing now is that people are very much holding onto their collectibles and memorabilia because it is increasing in value as time goes by. So whenever there is an auction, the number of pieces available can be very limiting. And Marilyn is one of those people whose value doesn’t decrease. She holds value and increases in value. So people aren’t as quick to put up their items for auction. Therefore, the availability is getting harder.

MARILYN MONROE'S DRESSES FROM POPULAR MOVIES UP FOR AUCTION

FOX Business: How can one determine whether an item is authentic or not? What are some tell-tale signs you look out for?

Fortner: One of the first things you want to do is ensure you’re verifying authenticity. Where did the item come from? Did it come from that 1999 Christie’s sale or another auction sale, such as from Julien’s? You want to make sure it came from a major auction company and verify the year it was originally sold. Also, is there a photo that can be matched with the item? Is there a photo of Marilyn wearing the item, whether it was at home or a public event? Many items from my collection are photographed with Marilyn.

What I tell people to avoid is what I call second- or third-generation items, such as a seller saying, ""Marilyn gave this to me."" Those items usually come with a letter or certificate of authenticity. Those items are very risky purchases and, usually, they’re not authentic. There’s a huge market today, particularly on eBay, where people will create certificates of authenticity claiming this is an authentic item when, in reality, it was probably something acquired from a secondhand store. They’ll just purchase the item, create a letter of authenticity, and then sell it for thousands of dollars on eBay. Unfortunately, many people tend to believe an item is real just because it comes with a certificate claiming it came from Marilyn’s makeup artist or hairstylist. Usually, that’s not the case.

I’m so often contacted by people who say, ""I’ve got this item for sale, and here’s the letter of authenticity for it."" I’m in the position of having to tell them, ""This item is not real, and here’s how I know that."" A perfect example involves Marilyn’s foster sister, Bebe Goddard. Marilyn lived with the Goddard family for some time. [Later on], Bebe worked with a memorabilia dealer to create items that he sold for her, which were fake pieces. They even went as far as to spray Chanel No. 5 on those items. After she passed away, it was verified through her documents that these items were sold to people. Just because it was someone who was a part of Marilyn’s life, people believed they were real. And these items came with a certificate of authenticity claiming they were real.

Today, people continue to create these fake letters of authenticity. And it’s not only with Marilyn items. It’s with all kinds of celebrity memorabilia. There are a few real items on eBay that are authentic. I would advise people to stick with the major auction companies.

NYC APARTMENT OF HOLLYWOOD LEGEND GRETA GARBO HITS MARKET FOR $7.25M: ‘CINEMATIC VIEWS'

Also, autographs are very easy to forge. Today’s printers are so good. You can easily take a check, even an authentic Marilyn-owned check, and do a photocopy on the front and back. Then you’ll frame that item in a display case. A lot of times, people will do that. And, of course, many will think it’s real when, in reality, it’s just a copy. There are many other ways people forge signatures, even in autograph books and photographs. You have to do your homework and make sure that the item you’re purchasing is truly authentic.

FOX Business: What about if you’re a Marilyn fan and want to own something that once belonged to her? What’s the first piece of advice you would give them?

Fortner: My first piece of advice is to make sure this is something you’re going to have interest in the long-term, not just a spur-of-the-moment purchase. You don’t want to have buyer’s remorse. Also, set a budget. Auctions can get very emotional. It’s also very competitive. For some people, they just want to win. You want to make sure you set a budget and try not to go over it.

People also tend to forget there are premiums that the auction companies apply as part of selling an item, as well as taxes. I have come across people who don’t realize that, after winning an auction, there’s a certain percentage on top of that for the premium and then another percentage on top of that for state taxes. It does add up. I would also stick to the major auction companies, especially if you’re starting.

FOX Business: Every year, Marilyn continues to be one of the top-earning dead celebrities. How is she earning top dollar today?

Fortner: Marilyn’s estate is owned by Authentic Brands Group, which is a company that owns the rights, licenses, marketing, advertising and branding for many deceased celebrities. They license Marilyn’s name and image to people who want to promote certain products. She’s still very much in demand, which is why Marilyn is one of the highest-earning dead celebrities today."

The boys took acting classes together, sparking what would become a lifelong partnership as collaborators and friends.

Affleck obtained his first professional acting job when he was just 7 years old for a local independent film.

Affleck, 49, made his mark in several blockbuster films, including 1998’s ""Armageddon"" and ""Shakespeare in Love,"" also released that same year. He has also appeared in every View Askewniverse film by his pal, director Kevin Smith, including 1999’s ""Dogma,"" 2001’s ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" 2006’s ""Clerks II,"" and 2019’s ""Jay and Silent Bob Reboot."" Affleck, who has had a passion for working behind the scenes, directed his first film, ""Gone Baby Gone,"" in 2007. He wrote, produced and directed 2010’s ""The Town."" He produced, directed and starred in 2012’s ""Argo,"" which won the Oscar for Best Picture.

Affleck’s paycheck in Hollywood has increased over the years. The 2000 film ""Reindeer Games"" earned him $6 million, while 2002’s ""Changing Lanes"" and ""The Sum of All Fears"" resulted in $10 million each. While ""Daredevil"" and ""Gigli"" were box office bombs, he still obtained $11.5 million and $12.5 million for his roles.

Over the years, Affleck has supported several charities, including the Paralyzed Veterans of America, Eastern Congo Initiative, the A-T Children's Project and Feeding America.

INSIDE THE WILD $65M MANSION JENNIFER LOPEZ AND BEN AFFLECK JUST TOURED

When it came to real estate, Affleck and Lopez spent $17.5 million in 2009 for a home previously owned by producer Brian Grazer. Lopez lived in the property until late 2018, when she and Affleck reportedly sold the mansion to Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine for $32 million. That year, Affleck bought a $19 million mansion in the Pacific Palisades.

Lopez and Affleck famously dated in the early 2000s, spawning the nickname ""Bennifer,"" before rekindling their romance last year. They earlier starred together in 2003′s ""Gigli"" and 2004′s ""Jersey Girl."" Around that time, they became engaged but never wed.

Affleck married Jennifer Garner in 2005, with whom he shares three children. They divorced in 2018.

Lopez has been married three times before. She was briefly married to Ojani Noa from 1997-1998 and to Cris Judd from 2001-2003. She and singer Marc Anthony were married for a decade after their wedding in 2004 and share 14-year-old twins.

Both Ukraine and Russia are thought to be using DJI drones in combat, even though the company maintains that its products are intended for civilian use.

Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykhailo Federov wrote an open letter last month appealing to DJI to block sales of its drones in Russia, contending that Russian troops were using ""DJI products in Ukraine in order to navigate their missiles to kill civilians.""

The AeroScope system installed in DJI drones allows the detection and monitoring of other drones and their operators in the vicinity via special receivers. The worry is that Russians might be using the AeroScope system to attack Ukraine drone pilots.

DJI has rejected claims that it leaked data on Ukraine’s military positions to Russia, after German retailer Mediamarkt cited Russia’s use of DJI drones in the war as a reason it removed the company’s products from its shelves.

Last week, DJI said in a statement that its drones are not marketed or sold for military use. It said it ""unequivocally opposed attempts to attach weapons"" to its products.

But Sievert’s cancellation opened the floodgates. It was as if the Hoover Dam of show guests had broken.

I’ve been covering CES since 2008 and every year, the world’s largest microchip manufacturer has claimed the biggest footprint – a sprawling booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center where the company spent a fortune designing a huge, glittering display of its latest silicon chips that laptop and tablet makers couldn’t run or compute without.

What happened was just the opposite, and as the Supreme Court considers President Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate and COVID-19 testing rules for the nation’s businesses, justices should look closely at what appears to be a successful test of whether requiring vaccinations will be the key to the nation moving safely back to normal.

CTA, the consumer technology trade association that represents the $422 billion U.S. consumer tech industry and runs CES, decided to create its in-person show model from scratch. CTA President and CEO Gary Shapiro didn’t waver even as more than a dozen tech leaders scrubbed their travel plans. He insisted the show would go on.

In fact, it would be more than just another Vegas convention: it would be the first large-scale test in the nation of whether a massive indoor event drawing thousands of people from all over the world could be pulled off in the middle of a highly contagious pandemic without turning into a superspreader event.

How CES Tackled the Challenge

It wouldn’t be easy. Well before omicron was even identified, CTA began preparing. It put in a mass order with Abbott Labs for the company’s BinaxNOW COVID-19 rapid self-test kits and began working with health experts and Nevada’s Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak to formulate the protocols and the plan.

Every attendee would have to register his or her proof of two vaccination shots (one if they got the Johnson & Johnson jab) via the Clear App. Vaccines must be FDA or World Health Organization-approved. No exceptions.

Upon arrival in Las Vegas, attendees would be required to present that proof at one of dozens of booths CES set up at airports, hotels and the convention center, after which they’d be handed their official credential and two free rapid COVID-19 tests. Masks would be required at all times on the convention floor and the 10 other CES venues around the city. Journalists could only remove their masks during live interviews. There would be free rapid testing at the convention center for the duration of the four-day event. The convention center, which spans more than 4 million square feet of exhibition space, was outfitted with enhanced air filtration systems, and international travelers would get a free PCR test after the show ended.

On Dec. 30, the nation set a devastating record: the highest number of daily infections reported.

By Dec. 31, citing the need for additional safety measures, CES announced it was dropping the last day of the four-day convention.

Business television networks Bloomberg and CNBC pulled out. My crew and I were still in. I made my pact when I chose this profession. Given a choice, I would run toward news stories. As a local news reporter, I’ve covered Category 5 hurricanes, riots, crack house busts and toxic explosions. Frank Merola, one of the FBN photographers coming with me to Vegas, had rushed to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster to cover it for the network. We would remain vigilant the entire trip.

Experts Weigh In

I won’t say I wasn’t concerned. I reached out to Dr. Harry Sax, executive vice chair of surgery at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. When I told him I was going to cover CES, he thought for a moment and then said, ""I think it’s important that you go. As long as you mitigate risk. Think about it. We don’t want planes to crash, but the answer isn’t ‘don’t fly planes.’ That’s not acceptable or realistic. The answer is, mitigate risk as best you can and then move forward. This vaccine-only event appears to be aiming for that. CES will be a test observed by the world.""

What It Was Like

Armed with a healthy dose of paranoia, my team and I arrived in Vegas on Jan. 4 to find greatly diminished crowds. At its peak in 2019, CES drew 170,000 exhibitors and leaders. This time, the final tally would shrink more than 70% to just over 45,000. But just as big names pulled out, 2,300 small- and medium-sized businesses, along with major names from Samsung to Chrysler parent Stellantis to smartphone chip giant Qualcomm to farm equipment maker John Deere (which brought a 44,000-pound autonomous tractor), arrived.

Before a large crowd Tuesday night, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon unveiled a virtual reality headset for the metaverse. Qualcomm is partnering with Microsoft to create the new digital universe hardware. Amon told FOX Business, ""We’re happy to be here. We had a press conference yesterday. People told me there are (only) going to be five people in the room, but we actually had a full room of 250 people.""

Thursday night, CTA also made the decision to hold its annual Leaders in Technology dinner at the Wynn Cristal Ballroom. VIPs, including a dozen members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, attended. In order to maintain social distance, organizers limited tables to seven people each vs. the usual 10.

Did It Work?

Sunday, CTA gave some final numbers. More than 2,300 businesses had voluntarily bought into the mandate and made the trip to CES, as did 4,500 attendees. Shapiro told FOX Business, ""At this point, I am aware of only a few positive COVID tests of actual CES attendees."" While he declined to give specific numbers because CTA was still compiling exact figures, I can say not one of my crew tested positive, even though there were points during the three-day conference when we were surrounded by crowds. Because of the CES rules, those crowds were all masked and vaccinated.

As the Supreme Court ponders whether the federal government has the authority to impose such mandates, leaving it up to businesses to impose mandates appropriate for their workforce is a good idea and CES proves that businesses will buy into such a policy when it furthers their business interests. Moreover, the mandates required by CES appear to have worked.

So, however the Supreme Court rules, businesses should stick to a mandate policy. If 45,000 people congregating indoors can avoid being a superspreader event because of vaccination and mask mandates, then let's have corporations spread these super best practices far and wide."

How to detect spyware

Spyware surreptitiously gathers information about you, such as internet usage data, and then sends it to another party. The most malicious spyware will install software that changes the settings on your phone and/or steals usernames and passwords.

It typically lands on your phone along with a program or app that you installed yourself. ""Spyware often accompanies programs that are disguised as useful software, such as download managers, registry cleaners, and so on,"" Internet security company Kaspersky says.

DHS REQUIRES 'CRITICAL' PIPELINES TO AMP UP CYBERSECURITY PROTECTIONS IN WAKE OF COLONIAL PIPELINE HACK

In some cases, spyware is secretly installed by a parent but it may also be installed by a suspicious partner, according to a spyware primer from Avast, which offers internet security applications.

Some indicators of spyware can be an overheating phone, a battery that drains too fast, excessive data usage, and annoying messages that pop up when you’re browsing the internet, Avast says.

How to remove spyware

Think you have spyware? Spyware removal tools may help in detecting and removing it. Anti-virus companies such as McAfee offer spyware removal apps.

You can also manually remove suspicious apps that you don’t recognize. Just follow iOS or Android instructions for deleting apps on your phone.

In a worst-case scenario, you can do a factory reset of your phone. This will erase all data from your phone, including the spyware. But you need to make sure the backup you use for the reset is dated before you got the spyware, says Avast.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

One of the best strategies is to make sure your phone’s operating system software is up to date.

""Some iPhone spy software is effective only because of an iOS security flaw. Hackers are always looking for software vulnerabilities to exploit, which Apple regularly fixes via Apple security updates,"" says Avast. So, the best way to stop the spyware is updating to the latest iOS release."

Weird to normalOne of the worst things about change is that the new way of doing things just feels weird.
Having the ability to accept and respond well to necessary change is going to become more important with every passing day.
Therefore, I invite you to rewire yourself in this way: to learn to think and feel differently about change; to become change-capable.
Erika Andersen is the founding partner of Proteus, a coaching, consulting and training firm that focuses on leader readiness.","Think of the last time your boss, your boss's boss or an HR person told you that a change was coming – some new way to do something, or a restructuring, or a new system to learn.

If you’re like most people, your first reaction was probably more negative than positive. Perhaps something like: ""Arrgh, as if the past eighteen months haven’t been stressful enough…"" – along with a sinking feeling and a sense of being newly overwhelmed.

Why is the idea of change – especially change imposed upon us – so often unwelcome? Given the past few years of massive change and disruption on so many levels, you’d think we would have gotten used to non-stop personal and professional change by now.

Our Anti-Change Wiring

Blame our experience as a species. For most of human history, change has been dangerous; the safest course of action has generally been to return to the known. If there was a famine, you wanted to get back to eating regularly. If there was an invading army, you wanted to get back to peace and prosperity.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS

You get the idea. Most of the time, returning to a previous set of stable conditions was the way to go.

Over many thousands of years, this has resulted in most people seeing most change as a threat. But today, to be successful, we often have to make changes in how we work, who we work with, and how we deal with customers.

So, what’s a human to do? Try these five things:

1. Find out more

When an unexpected change comes at us, we often just shut down and stop listening after the word ""different."" But there’s some key information about any change that will help you decide how best to respond. First, ask for more clarity about what the change is – what it means for you, practically. Then ask why it’s happening, so you get some sense of possible benefits. Finally, ask the person promoting the change what the post-change future will look like – how it will affect the business, the customers, the employees. Having this key information can make the change start to seem less overwhelming and more understandable.



2. Difficult to doable

Most often, when we first hear about a change, we assume it’s going to be difficult – that we won’t know how to do it, or that others will make it hard to do. Instead, turn your mind toward how you could make it easier. Is there someone who already knows how to do what you’re being asked to do, who could help you? Is there training available? Can you talk to your boss about what it will take?

3. Costly to rewarding

We also tend to think that a change is going to take away more than it gives us: that learning how to do it will take time we can’t spare or that it will hurt our reputation – that we’ll look bad trying to do something we’re not used to doing. The change will seem less daunting if you can also focus on how it might be rewarding: maybe the new way of doing things will take less time, once you’ve learned it, or will solve a problem that you know customers have been complaining about.

4. Weird to normal

One of the worst things about change is that the new way of doing things just feels weird. Anyone who’s ever had to learn to drive a stick shift as an adult, for instance, or gone to a religious celebration of another faith, knows that feeling of ""this just isn’t what I’m used to.""

Making a change feel normal is an important way to get past our hesitation, and sometimes the quickest way to do that is to find someone you like and respect who understands and is doing things in the new way and ask them to share with you what feels OK about it to them.

5. Practice makes perfect … or at Least OK

And finally, perhaps, the most important way to get comfortable with a new way of doing things or thinking about things is to do it. And then do it again.

If you think about anything you’ve learned as an adult – from swing dancing to speaking another language, to using a new social media platform – you probably remember the day when you had practiced enough that you suddenly thought, ""Oh, this isn’t so hard."" Once you’ve gotten some basic information about the change and started to look for ways it could be easy (or at least doable), rewarding and normal, take a deep breath and just jump into trying it out.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

Every indication is that the pace of change in our lives and in the world is going to continue to increase. It doesn’t look like we’re ever going to return to a time when everything is mostly status quo. Having the ability to accept and respond well to necessary change is going to become more important with every passing day.

Therefore, I invite you to rewire yourself in this way: to learn to think and feel differently about change; to become change-capable. It’s your best path to a successful, satisfying personal and professional life in this era of non-stop change.

""The mission of Telosa is to create a more equitable, sustainable future. That’s our North Star,"" Lore said in a promotional video. ""We are going to be the most open, the most fair and the most inclusive city in the world.""

WALMART INVESTING NEARLY $1B TO COVER TUITION, BOOK COSTS FOR US EMPLOYEES

Key to the city’s plans is Lore’s economic vision, called ""Equitism,"" in which the land upon which the city is built will be donated to a community endowment.

Residents, in turn, own their homes on the land and are enriched as home values increase, according to the project’s site, and after a period of ""hyper-growth,"" residents can buy the land from the community endowment.

""If you went into the desert where the land was worth nothing, or very little, and you created a foundation that owned the land, and people moved there and tax dollars built infrastructure and we built one of the greatest cities in the world, the foundation could be worth a trillion dollars,"" Lore told Bloomberg Businessweek.

""And if the foundation’s mission was to take the appreciation of the land and give it back to the citizens in the form of medicine, education, affordable housing, social services: Wow, that’s it!""

The city is meant to take on what Lore views as the United States’ biggest challenge — the rapidly growing wealth gap, which he said ""is going to bring down America.""

""While the current economic system is a growth engine, it has led to increasing inequality,"" the project’s website explains. ""Equitism is inclusive growth.""

The initial phase of the project, targeted for completion by 2030, would be built to accommodate 50,000 residents across roughly 1,500 acres at a cost of $25 billion, Businessweek reported.

Over 40 years, the city will eventually require $400 billion in funding and grow to house as many as 5 million people across 150,000 acres, the site says.

The project’s planners have yet to commit to a location, but the website identifies Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Texas and the Appalachian region as possible sites.

In June, Lore hired Copenhagen-based architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group to design the city.

Sleek renderings imagine plenty of space for pedestrians to stroll in the lush metropolis, and include images of planes and other aircrafts that appear to be from Archer Aviation, the electric ""air taxi"" startup in which Lore is an investor.

Another image on the site shows a skyscraper called Equitism tower that houses elevated water storage, aeroponic farms and an energy-producing roof.

The streets ""prioritize bikes and pedestrians,"" according to the website, and slow-moving self-driving cars share the street.

Lore, who reportedly has a net worth of up to $4 billion, founded Quidsi, a company that owned e-commerce sites including diapers.com, and sold it to Amazon in 2010 for around $545 million.

He left Amazon after two years and founded Jet.com before selling it to Walmart in 2016, joining the retail giant as head of US e-commerce.

The chronic entrepreneur left the company earlier this year to pursue other projects that were unannounced at the time.

He’s since bought a stake in the Minnesota Timberwolves and Lynx, and started a new venture capital firm with Alex Rodriguez called Vision Capital People.

STUART VARNEY: Two 40th anniversaries this week and both have great significance for the present.

Start with IBM's first home computer. Introduced on August 12, 1981. The IBM 51-50 model was a real breakthrough. It was huge. It weighed 25 pounds and was built in Boca Raton, Florida. Imagine that, made in America.

It had 16 kilobytes of memory! Even I know that’s not much.

The other anniversary is 40 years ago on August 13, President Reagan launched massive tax cuts.

The typical living costs for a full-time college student during the 2022-23 academic year will range from $20,470 on a low budget to $30,560 on a moderate budget, according to College Board . That’s a substantial chunk of change for college students already tasked with covering their school tuition, often with student loans.

The good news is student loans cover more than just tuition. You can use student loans to pay for living expenses like room and board, transportation, and miscellaneous costs. Here’s a closer look at how to pay for college living expenses, including what you can and can’t pay for with student loans.



Credible lets you compare private student loan rates from multiple lenders, all in one place.

You can use student loans for living expenses

Your lender generally disburses student loan funds directly to your school to pay for your tuition and fees. Any remaining funds are paid to you, and you can use the money to cover living expenses and other costs related to your education.

Before you apply for student loans , always begin by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) . Schools use this form to determine what types of federal aid you qualify for. Exhaust all your FAFSA options — like scholarships, grants, and federal loans — before turning to private student loans to bridge any funding gaps.

Student loans backed by the federal government provide access to better benefits, like low, fixed rates, access to income-driven repayment plans, and the potential for loan forgiveness. Additionally, federal student loans may be easier to obtain if you have bad credit since they don’t require a credit check or consider your credit score.

Also, keep in mind that some student loans come with limits which will determine your borrowing amount. You might receive more money if you’re a graduate student, as graduate student loans typically carry substantially higher limits than undergraduate loans.

For example, undergraduates may qualify for a Direct Unsubsidized Loan with limits ranging from $5,500 and $12,500 per year, depending on whether you’re a dependent or an independent student. By contrast, student loan limits for graduates and professionals top out at $20,500 per year.

The amount you may borrow in private student loans varies from lender to lender, but many offer loan amounts up to 100% of the cost of attendance.

What expenses can you pay for with student loans?

Student loans are intended to help you pay for expenses that fall under the cost of attendance (COA) for your school, including:

Tuition

Education-related fees, such as registration, graduation, and parking

Textbooks

Room and board

Housing utilities

Housing supplies

Transportation expenses

Computers

Food and meal plans

Dependent care

Disability expenses

Consult with your school’s financial aid office to determine the COA for your school and for more information on acceptable uses for student loan funds.

What can’t student loans be used for?

The list of expenses you can pay for with federal or private student loan funds is extensive, but there are exceptions. Aim to keep your student loan debt low by being mindful of how you spend your loan funds, and try to use them sparingly for essential expenses as necessary.

Along those lines, you can’t use student loans for unapproved expenses, such as:

Clothing

Video games

Business expenses

Down payment on a home

Entertainment

Vacations

New vehicle (but gas, operation, and maintenance expenses are allowed)

Remember, when you sign for a student loan , you agree only to use the money to pay for your education and related expenses. If the U.S. Department of Education discovers that you used student loan funds for unapproved expenses, they may cancel your loan agreement and seek immediate repayment.

Other ways to pay for living expenses while in college

Student loans aren’t the only way to pay for higher education. Here are some alternative options:

Apply for gift aid. Paying for college doesn’t have to involve debt. Federal grants and college scholarships can help you get the money you need, and you don’t have to repay them. Scholarships and grants are available through schools, employers, nonprofit organizations, local businesses, and other institutions.

How Credible picked the best student loan companies

Credible evaluated private student loan lenders in 10 different categories to determine the best student loan lenders. This included interest rates, repayment options, terms, fees, discounts, customer service availability, as well as eligibility requirements and cosigner release options.



If you need to take out private student loans, visit Credible to compare private student loan rates from various lenders in minutes.

Can you get a student loan with a 600 credit score?

In most cases, if you have bad credit, your options may be more limited if you want to qualify for a private student loan on your own — many lenders typically require good credit and a steady source of income to qualify.

Some lenders may offer student loans for borrowers with bad credit , but these loans may come with higher interest rates compared to loans for borrowers with good credit. You can consider taking out a loan with a cosigner who has good credit so that you can increase your chances of qualifying for a loan or of getting a better rate.

It’s important to find a cosigner you trust and to look for a loan that offers a cosigner release if you want that option. When doing your research, see if the lender offers a cosigner release option and what the requirements are. For example, some lenders may require you to make a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments before you can apply for a cosigner release."

With easy access to vaccinations and low hospitalization rates among college-aged adults -- even during the latest surge in BA.5 subvariant cases -- administrators said it is time to lift or at least rethink restrictions and redefine the virus as endemic, not a pandemic. That means scaling back mass testing, removing bans on large indoor gatherings and preparing for a fall term that more closely resembles life before Covid.

Another issue driving the decisions is exhaustion, according to public-health experts and academics on several campuses. Students and staff have been subjected to two years of daily health checks, weekly trots to a testing center and a roller coaster of mask protocols.

""It really comes down to a change in mind-set,"" said Ken Henderson, who was co-chair of Northeastern University's Covid-management operations until the group disbanded in January. Citing clinical therapies and the reduced severity of current variants, he said, ""We've pivoted significantly to more living with the virus.""

DESPITE HIGH INFLATION, BACK-TO-SCHOOL SPENDING PROJECTED TO HIT $37B

Northeastern is mandating vaccines and boosters for the fall, but already eliminated indoor mask mandates and surveillance testing and no longer offers dedicated isolation space for infected students.

""Campuses are moving in the direction of pretending Covid is no longer an issue,"" said Chris Marsicano, an assistant professor of educational studies at Davidson College who has been tracking colleges' responses to Covid since early 2020. ""When there's a flare-up, treat the flare-up. Don't have restrictions all the time.""

That should be fine for most students and staff who are vaccinated and not immunocompromised, said A. David Paltiel, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health. But ""indifference to off-campus transmission and transmission to more vulnerable members of the community is a little bit heartbreaking.""

Schools said they could still reverse course if variants lead to more-severe illness or local health officials recommend changes.

One of the biggest changes schools are making is dropping surveillance testing of asymptomatic students and staff, and, with that shift, abandoning online dashboards that tracked cases and positivity rates the past two years.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION CANCELING $6 BILLION IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR 200,000 BORROWERS

The College of Charleston in South Carolina isn't requiring students to show negative Covid-19 tests upon arrival this fall, said Alicia Caudill, executive vice president for student affairs. The school did require entry testing last year. She said the college will have thousands of at-home tests and KN-95 masks for students who want them.

""You have to make the best decisions for yourself,"" rather than relying on blanket policies from the school, Ms. Caudill said.

Georgia Institute of Technology did away with asymptomatic surveillance testing in July and instead will study wastewater to try to detect large outbreaks.

Dr. Paltiel said that approach makes sense, given how quickly the latest Omicron subvariants seem to be spreading, and how virulent future strains might be.

""You're sounding like the generals who are always getting ready to fight the previous war,"" he said of schools sticking with old approaches, like mandatory weekly testing.

Most schools are maintaining vaccine mandates, but some are adjusting who is covered by the rules or exactly what counts as being vaccinated.

BOSTON UNIVERSITY ISSUES LARGEST TUITION INCREASE IN 14 YEARS, BLAMES INFLATION

The board of trustees at San Joaquin Delta College in California voted last month to remove vaccine and booster requirements for students.

""We're trying to be flexible while recognizing that we really do need to provide in-person services,"" said spokesman Alex Breitler, adding that unvaccinated students previously couldn't participate in hands-on programs.

The State University of New York's Orange County Community College isn't mandating boosters this fall, while the San Diego Community College District no longer requires vaccines for students. The district maintains a mask mandate.

Schools are often issuing guidance that students who test positive for Covid isolate in place, meaning they lock down in their dorms, even with uninfected roommates, rather than moving to other designated housing while contagious.

In its guidance for the fall, Cornell University recommended that students who test positive ""wear a high-quality mask at all times except when eating, sleeping or using bathroom facilities (e.g., showering, brushing teeth).""

University of California, Irvine, set aside 166 beds for isolation housing this fall, down from 362 in the spring. David Souleles, director of the school's Covid-19 response team, said that is partly in response to updated guidance from public-health officials. Cutting isolation beds will also free up more beds for the general student population in the midst of a housing crunch.

MISSOURI UNIVERSITY AGREES TO $1.65 MILLION SETTLEMENT IN COVID-19 LAWSUIT FROM STUDENTS

Leslie Bienen, a public-health researcher at Oregon Health and Science University-Portland State University School of Public Health, said that by the time one roommate tests positive for Covid, chances are anyone else they lived with was already exposed.

Moving students into separate housing, she said, ""is kind of closing the barn door after the horse is gone.""

As in-person classes once again become the norm, schools are scaling back their online and hybrid offerings -- including for students who fall ill.

Rates for 10- and 15-year repayment terms are still below 5%, meaning homeowners may want to consider refinancing to a shorter term to save on interest.

How mortgage rates have changed over time

Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac – 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates. When considering a mortgage refinance or purchase, it’s important to take into account closing costs such as appraisal, application, origination and attorney’s fees. These factors, in addition to the interest rate and loan amount, all contribute to the cost of a mortgage.

How Credible mortgage rates are calculated

Changing economic conditions, central bank policy decisions, investor sentiment, and other factors influence the movement of mortgage rates. Credible average mortgage rates and mortgage refinance rates reported in this article are calculated based on information provided by partner lenders who pay compensation to Credible.

The rates assume a borrower has a 740 credit score and is borrowing a conventional loan for a single-family home that will be their primary residence. The rates also assume no (or very low) discount points and a down payment of 20%.

Credible mortgage rates reported here will only give you an idea of current average rates. The rate you actually receive can vary based on a number of factors.

How to get low mortgage rates

If you want to get the lowest possible monthly mortgage payment, taking the following steps can help you secure a lower rate on your home loan:

Improving your credit score

Paying down debt

Making a bigger down payment

It’s also a good idea to compare rates from different lenders to find the best rate for your financial goals. According to research from Freddie Mac , borrowers can save $1,500 on average over the life of their loan by shopping for just one additional rate quote – and an average of $3,000 by comparing five rate quotes.

If you’re trying to find the right mortgage rate, consider using Credible. You can use Credible's free online tool to easily compare multiple lenders and see prequalified rates in just a few minutes.

Rates for 10- and 15-year repayment terms are still below 5%, meaning homeowners may want to consider refinancing to a shorter term to save on interest. At 4.750%, homeowners looking to refinance may find that 15-year terms offer the best opportunity for a lower interest rate and manageable monthly payment.

WHAT IS CASH-OUT REFINANCING AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

How mortgage rates have changed over time

Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac — 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates.

Is now a good time to refinance?

Everyone’s situation is different, but generally, it may be a good time to refinance if:

You’ll be able to get a lower interest rate than you currently have.

Refinancing will save you money over the life of your home loan.

Your savings from refinancing will ultimately exceed closing costs.

You know you’ll be staying in your home long enough to recoup the costs of refinancing.

You have sufficient equity in your home to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI).

If your home needs significant, costly repairs it might be a good time to refinance in order to withdraw some equity to pay for those repairs. Just be aware that lenders generally limit the amount you can take from your home in a cash-out refinance.

His work showed how an investment strategy diversified across common stocks and intermediate-term Treasury bonds could help a retiree navigate a 30-year retirement with very little chance of running out of money.

Today, in the age of low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on indexes, it becomes pretty simple to create such a portfolio with just two funds. For stocks, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is certainly worth considering. For intermediate Treasury bonds, it's hard to beat the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury Fund Index ETF. Put those two ETFs together in an intelligent way, and they could very well wind up being all you need for retirement.

How the 4% rule works

Bengen's work that came up with the 4% rule focused on retirees who maintained a well-diversified portfolio that was somewhere between a mix of 75% stocks and 25% bonds and a 50-50 mix of the two. He looked back across historical market returns and inflation rates and assumed that a retiree would want to maintain a steady lifestyle throughout retirement, after accounting for inflation.

With those assumptions in place, he checked to see how much a person could withdraw every year and still have a very strong chance of winding up completing a 30-year retirement without running out of money. He calculated that by keeping that diversified and balanced portfolio, a retiree could start by spending 4% of the portfolio's initial account balance and adjust those withdrawals for inflation each year.

Say, for instance, that you expect to need $48,000 a year in retirement ($4,000 per month) to cover your costs and that Social Security should provide you around $1,500 per month. Since Social Security adjusts its payout for inflation each year, you'd need your nest egg to cover the other $2,500 per month -- $30,000 per year. Thanks to the 4% rule, it looks like you could cover that gap with a nest egg of $750,000 across the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight and the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETFs.

Why include the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF?

The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF invests in the same companies that make up most S&P 500 trackers, but it does so a little bit differently. While the typical S&P 500 fund is market-capitalization weighted, the Invesco ETF uses an equal-weighting strategy. In other words, it seeks to own about the same dollar amount in each company in that index.

That gives the Invesco ETF a leg up on diversification, as by market capitalization, the top 10 companies (11 securities due to different share classes) represent nearly 30% of the index. By contrast, in the Invesco ETF, the top 10 holdings represent less than 2.7% of the fund's holdings. That means the Invesco fund is less exposed to challenges that face the largest companies in that index than the typical S&P 500 fund is.

It offers that diversification benefit while still carrying a modest 0.2% expense ratio, which means that the fund's shareholders get virtually all the returns of owning the underlying stocks. Between that modest expense ratio and that diversified portfolio of S&P 500 stocks, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is worthy of consideration for the stock allocation of your retirement portfolio.

Why include the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF?

The Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF generally invests in U.S. Treasury bonds that mature in three to 10 years.

That time frame is important. As an intermediate-term bond fund, it doesn't own the bonds with the shortest or the longest maturity dates. That three-to-10-year range can provide a sweet spot where the bonds offer higher interest rates than the shortest-term bonds but don't fall in price nearly as far as long-term bonds can when rates rise.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

In addition, as an ETF that owns Treasury bonds, it faces a fairly low default risk. The U.S. government can print dollars while generally borrowing in dollar-denominated bonds. While printing money can drive inflation, that combination -- along with the government's ability to tax -- does provide a very high likelihood that U.S. Treasury debt will be paid.

Although intermediate-term Treasury bonds are not likely to provide a high rate of return over time, they do offer more stability of pricing than stocks do. That's why they play a role in the 4% rule: to make sure you have some higher-certainty money available when you need spending cash. With a nearly invisible 0.05% expense ratio, investors in the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF get the benefits of owning those bonds for very low overhead.

Two funds for a great future

The beauty of these two ETFs is that not only can they be the core to your plan once you retire, but you can also use them while you're accumulating your retirement nest egg as well. With a longer time horizon while you're still working, you'll likely want to tilt your allocation more heavily toward the stock fund.

As your retirement approaches, you'll want to draw closer to the balanced allocation that's so important when you're spending down your nest egg. Still, you can get away with just these two ETFs and have a great shot at making it to (and through) a financially comfortable retirement.

That growth rate should be attainable over 20-plus years in a retirement portfolio that's heavy on stock ETFs.
CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSSeven figures via ETFsYou can retire a millionaire with ETFs.","Can you retire a millionaire with ETFs alone? The simple answer is yes, you can. Here's how.

You don't have to beat the market

It's a common belief that investors get rich by picking individual stocks and beating the market. While that can be true, stock picking isn't the only path for investors to build wealth. Funds -- ETFs in particular -- can also make you a millionaire, even though many of them never beat the market.

In truth, the broader market provides enough growth potential to build a seven-figure retirement fund. Follow the four rules below to harness that market power and achieve your wealth goals without having to pick a single stock.

INFLATION-FIGHTING ETFS: HOW TO INVEST

1. Choose efficiency

Funds have administrative expenses that they pass along to shareholders. Those expenses dilute the returns of the underlying stock portfolio. If you choose cost-efficient funds, a greater portion of the ETF's earnings flow through to your bottom line.

Expense ratio is the metric you'll use to compare funds on cost efficiency. You'll see this number presented as a percentage that's some fraction of 1%, say 0.10%. A 0.10% expense ratio equates to expenses of $10 for every $10,000 you have invested.

Some index ETFs have expense ratios that are close to zero. iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, for example, both have expense ratios of 0.03%.

THIS VANGUARD ETF COULD MAKE YOU A MULTIMILLIONAIRE WITH ZERO EFFORT

If your 401(k) doesn't offer low-cost ETFs, ask your administrator if your account has a brokerage window. Or, invest in these funds in an IRA or taxable brokerage account instead.

2. Plan your asset allocation

Asset allocation is the composition of your portfolio across different asset classes, like stocks and bonds. Stocks deliver growth, with some risk, while bonds provide stability. You can mix and match the two to tailor your portfolio's risk and reward characteristics.

Since you're targeting millionaire status by retirement, you'll want a higher percentage of stock ETFs versus bond ETFs. If retirement is still decades away and you can handle some volatility, you could hold up to 90% stock funds. Start with a lower percentage if retirement is within 15 years or if stock market volatility makes you nervous.

3 BETTER WAYS TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT THAN A 401(K)

3. Invest generously and consistently

To amass seven figures with ETFs, you must invest generously and consistently -- for decades. The numbers below show monthly contributions required to get to $1 million on different timelines. Note that the monthly contributions could include your employer match.

$2,265 → 20 years

$1,518 → 25 years

$1,054 → 30 years

$748 → 35 years

$538 → 40

All scenarios assume average annual growth of 6%, which is a bit less than the stock market's long-term average after inflation. That growth rate should be attainable over 20-plus years in a retirement portfolio that's heavy on stock ETFs.

You can see that the monthly contribution gets unmanageable if you wait too long to start investing. That's your cue to kick this plan off today. Even if you're 30 years out from retirement and you can't afford to contribute $1,000 monthly, invest whatever you can today. You can raise your contribution later as your income increases.

4. Don't time the market

Whatever happens with the stock market, commit to staying invested and continuing your contributions. If you start pulling back on contributions or selling to avoid losses, you may never hit that million-dollar target.

It may sound counterintuitive, but selling to avoid losses usually lowers your returns. For example, the market drops, so you sell at a lower share price to stop the bleeding. You then wait until the market has stabilized to reinvest. At that point, you buy back your shares at higher prices than when you sold them for. Selling low and buying high creates a loss, which reduces your long-term returns.

If you stay invested when the market goes sideways, you don't have to worry about when to reinvest. You also remain well positioned to benefit when the market recovers.

Where you live can drastically affect the cost of your retirement and how far your savings will go. Here's a closer look at three ways your home can affect your retirement expenses.

BEST STATES FOR RETIREMENT IN 2022: REPORT

1. Some states tax Social Security benefits

When calculating your retirement income, you may assume that all your Social Security checks will go directly into your pocket. But that's not always the case. The following 13 states tax some of their residents' Social Security benefits:

But living in one of these places isn't a guarantee that you'll owe anything. Each state has its own rules, but most only take a cut of your benefits if your annual income or Social Security benefit exceeds certain thresholds.

If you live in one of the above 13 states or you intend to do so in retirement, you may want to check with the state department of taxation to learn which seniors owe benefit taxes. These rules may change between now and your retirement, so be sure to check on this every few years so you know what to expect.

If you don't want to deal with Social Security benefit taxes at all, you could consider retiring in one of the 37 states that don't tax seniors' Social Security benefits. But even if you do this, you could still owe federal taxes. The only way around these is to limit your taxable income. If that's not possible, you'll have to account for Social Security benefit taxes in your retirement plan.

3 SOCIAL SECURITY SECRETS FOR EVEN BIGGER CHECKS

2. Some places have a higher cost of living than others

Urban areas tend to have a higher cost of living than rural areas, so retirees living in cities will often have to save more to cover all their retirement expenses. Even among cities, though, there's a lot of variation in terms of cost.

If you plan to remain in your current city during retirement, you probably already have an idea of how much your expenses will be. But if you plan to move, it's a good idea to look at how the average cost of living in your chosen retirement city stacks up to the cost of living in your current city.

You should especially pay attention to the basics, like food and housing. But medical care should be high on your list, as well. People often see their healthcare expenses rise as they age, and this can take a significant bite out of your retirement savings.

THIS IS YOUR BIGGEST ENEMY WHEN SAVING FOR RETIREMENT

3. Staying put could save you money if you own your home outright

A monthly rent or mortgage payment can take up a significant portion of your budget, but it's not something all seniors have to deal with. Those who own their homes outright may find it's more affordable for them to remain where they are, rather than move elsewhere and take on a new housing payment.

Even if you owe money on your home, staying where you are could still be the right choice. This is especially true if housing costs have risen in your area since you first bought your home. If you try to move elsewhere, you might find that you're paying a lot more per month than you would have to if you remained in your current home.

But sometimes, moving could be the best decision. If you're downsizing, for example, you might end up with a more affordable monthly payment. Or if you sell your home for a sizable profit, you may be able to buy a more affordable home elsewhere and actually make a little money.

Ultimately, you have to base your decision on what you feel would make you the happiest in retirement.

FED OFFICIALS SIGNAL MORE INTEREST RATE HIKES TO COME, DESPITE GROWING RECESSION RISKS

President Biden has reiterated that tackling surging inflation is his top priority.

Biden has claimed he does not think the U.S. would be entering a recession in the near future, and his administration — including White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and economic advisor Brian Deese — is now denying that the U.S. is in a recession, despite sharp inflation.

Biden declared his administration's top priority was ""getting price increases under control"" earlier this month after the Department of Labor reported that inflation soared 9.1% over the last 12 months.

If the winner decides to take the $780.5 million lump sum, approximately $187.3 million in federal taxes would be withheld, in addition to $38.6 million in state taxes. That would mean an estimated take-home payout of $554.6 million.

If the winner takes the full $1.337 billion in annual installments and tax rates don't change over the next 29 years, an estimated $320.9 million in federal taxes would be withheld, and an estimated $66.2 in state taxes would be withheld.

Chad Carden, founder of consulting firm The Carden Group, said many employees had been lured away by promises of higher pay, better titles and better perks during the Great Resignation.

Younger professionals, in particular, also had a ""heightened expectation"" to have more paid time off, schedule flexibility and meaningful work and were willing to make a change to attain this, according to Kelly Lannan, senior vice president for emerging customers at Fidelty Investments.

""For instance, sign-on bonuses seem great, but is it being offered because the organization's culture isn't one that cultivates value and fulfillment in its employees?""

Carden stressed that it's vital for employees to do their due diligence and to look into the offer and company before taking the job.

Morgan agreed, saying that it is in the employer's benefit to focus on the wellness of their staff and ensure that workers are satisfied with the culture of the workplace.

""Organizations that are navigating the impacts of inflation and constricting budgets are facing tough business decisions, but it does cost much less money and is better for company morale overall to reskill and redeploy existing talent rather than overhauling workforces entirely,"" he added.

That said, Morgan argued that Great Resignation has shifted how companies prepare for a possible recession.

FOX Business has reached out to Lemoine for comment but did not hear back before publication.

Lemoine appeared to reference his firing in a Saturday tweet, referring to a blog post he wrote in which he anticipated being fired for raising his concerns about AI ethics.

""Today I was placed on ‘paid administrative leave’ by Google in connection to an investigation of AI ethics concerns I was raising within the company,"" Lemoine wrote.

Google did not respond to FOX Business’ request for comment.

In a statement to the Big Technology Podcast, Google said all employees’ concerns about the company’s work are ""extensively"" reviewed, and found Lemoine’s claims about LaMDA being sentient ""wholly unfounded.""

If I'm a trading card collector, I want my trading cards.""
We're launching with comic books; all the comic books are obtained directly from Marvel and DC – we're not touching anything in a secondary market.","For the first time since 2019, the Mecca for SciFi and Fantasy enthusiasts returns to San Diego for its first in-person convention since before the coronavirus pandemic - and in anticipation of the highly-anticipated four-day event beginning July 21, the famed global sports/entertainment trading card and collectibles company Upper Deck announced its newest initiative on Comic-Con Preview Night: the launch of ‘Collect Forever.’



""Our goal is to service collectors and help them collect the way they want to collect,"" Upper Deck President Jason Masherah told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview of the revolutionary expansion - which he said moves to bridge NFTs with tangible collectibles and includes a ""very natural extension"" into comic books given its established partnership with staples like Marvel.



""We wanted to create a space where people could essentially bring any collectible into this ecosystem and allow them to trade — and what's really cool as a collector is, you could now trade a Wayne Gretzky trading card for a Spider-Man comic book,"" the Upper Deck president said, noting the company's desire to extend to other collectibles outside the trading card realm.



Masherah introduced the world to Collect Forever at the multi-genre entertainment event Wednesday, adding that initial products to be available for purchase will include pre-ordered collectibles from Marvel, DC Comics, and Funko POP.

""We're much more than people realize,"" Masherah noted. ""We're typically known as a trading card company, but we have three distinct divisions of the company here. We have trading cards - which not only include sports trading cards but entertainment trading cards, which a lot of people don't realize; we have the autographed memorabilia, and then we have games. We make tabletop games, board games, and trading card games.""



As of Wednesday, the company will now add comic books to its repertoire.



Comic book collectors will rejoice over Collect Forever's variant cover options, which Masherah likened to opening a trading card pack.



""There's this phenomenon in the comic book world called variant covers; typically they're incentives for the comic book shops; if you buy 20 copies of a comic, you get a limited edition variant cover - and typically, the shop either has them designated for other customers, or they use them to try and make a profit in the shop,"" Masherah explained.



""We're actually randomly distributing those when people buy comics; so if you buy a $5 comic book, you have the opportunity to get a variant cover that might be worth $50 or $100. It's kind of like opening a trading card pack,"" Masherah said of the new offering.

""We're giving people access to things they might not have had access to before,"" Jason Masherah told Fox News Digital of Upper Deck's new launch, ‘Collect Forever’

Collect Forever, in addition to Upper Deck's e-Pack, will serve as a one-stop shop for collectors, bridging the benefits of an NFT with a true, tangible collectible and allowing consumers an opportunity to store their collectibles on an e-Pack account.



Masherah explained the setup allows collectors who may not have the physical space to store their entire collection of comic books, toys, figurines, etc., at home the ability to, instead, store them virtually (in physical vault-like storage facilities owned by Upper Deck).



He added that the expansion's objective targets not only those who lack the room to house their collectibles, but collectors who don't live in proximity to a brick and mortar:



""We also want to provide an online experience for people who maybe don't have a trading card or a comic book store close. The reality is, most cities don't have a trading card or comic book store; they [collectors] can't easily get figurines, and we want to be able to provide that solution - not only for our own products, but for all collectibles.""

""If I'm a comic book collector, I want my comic books. If I'm a trading card collector, I want my trading cards.""



Masherah also assured customers of the company's efforts in ensuring a safe and secure purchase.



""Everything that you buy on the site came directly from a manufacturer. We're launching with comic books; all the comic books are obtained directly from Marvel and DC – we're not touching anything in a secondary market. So customers can be assured that it's coming directly from the manufacturers,"" he told Fox News Digital.



""On top of that, we're encapsulating everything as well and marking them uncirculated so you know this was fresh out of the box. We're going to bar code and QR code all the items, and then you can essentially scan those bar codes and it will take you to an authentication site and give you the information on each particular collectible that you buy through the website.""

The pipeline had reopened at 40% capacity a week earlier after being down for 10 days for scheduled maintenance. Gazprom blamed that situation on sanctions that held up the return of a turbine that had been sent to Canada for repairs in June.

West Virginia announced last week it would bar five major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, from entering into banking contracts with the state treasurer's office or any state agency. Each of the five corporations had committed to policies limiting commercial engagement with the fossil fuel industry, which paid a whopping $769 million in taxes to West Virginia's state government.

""We're not going to pay for our own destruction, we're not going to subsidize that,"" West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore told FOX Business during an interview. ""They have weaponized our tax dollars against the very people and industry that have generated them to begin with. That is why we're pushing back against this ESG movement.""

He noted that U.S. Bancorp backed off its prohibition of fossil fuel lending and was, as a result, kept off the state's restricted list of financial institutions.

Moore's action, a first-of-its-kind response to major banks' ESG push, is likely to be the start of many similar actions nationwide. At least 15 Republican-led states, which collectively manage tens of billions of dollars in public funds, have proposed laws or policies that would similarly punish anti-fossil fuel banks over the last year, according to a FOX Business analysis.

Hegar is assembling a list like West Virginia's in accordance with a bill the Texas legislature passed last year. As part of the effort, Hegar sent letters to 19 financial institutions in March asking for clarification on their fossil fuel investment policies.

In addition to Texas, state financial officers in Kentucky, Oklahoma, Florida, South Carolina, Arizona, Louisiana, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas and North Dakota said they would take or consider action against banks that boycott energy companies. Kentucky and Oklahoma, like Texas, are compiling lists as required by recently passed state laws.

Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., unveiled a bill Wednesday seeking to force states to allow hydraulic fracturing by tying federal funds to the method of fossil fuel extraction.

States with statewide bans on fracking would be barred from receiving any funds from the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program under Tenney's legislation which was first obtained by FOX Business. The bill, which is set to be formally introduced Friday, is intended to target Tenney's home state of New York which first banned fracking in 2014 and codified the ban in 2020.

MANCHIN-SCHUMER BILL WOULD REINSTATE TAX ON IMPORTED OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

""New York State is sitting on top of natural gas formations that could power our state with clean energy for decades,"" Tenney told FOX Business in a statement. ""Unfortunately, far-left policies in Albany and Washington have severely limited our ability to safely tap into these reserves, threatening America’s energy independence, raising prices for consumers, and killing thousands of well-paying jobs.""

""As Americans struggle with record-high costs due to the Joe Biden and Kathy Hochul’s energy and economic illiteracy, it is time we take actions to reverse this disaster and restore our nation’s energy independence,"" she continued. ""Americans need clean energy at lower costs now, and delivering on this commitment can and should start right here in New York.""

The EECBG program, which is overseen by the Department of Energy, provides state and local governments grants to reduce fossil fuel emissions, reduce energy use and improve energy efficiency across various sectors. The program was appropriated $550 million under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which President Biden signed in November.

Tenney's office said the program is a ""perfect fit for being the enforcement mechanism of the law"" in a one-page summary of the bill shared with FOX Business.

GOP HAMMERS BIDEN FOR ALLOWING EMERGENCY OIL RESERVES TO GO TO CHINA: 'COMPROMISING OUR ENERGY SECURITY'

Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., issued a statewide ban on fracking in 2014 and, in 2020, introduced a bill codifying the ban into state law. The New York state legislature approved the bill as part of the fiscal year 2021 budget.

""New York's leadership on hydraulic fracturing protects the environment, our drinking water, and our health,"" Cuomo tweeted after he introduced the permanent ban in January 2020. ""We must make the ban permanent.""

New York is a net importer of natural gas, most which comes via pipeline from Pennsylvania, even though the Marcellus Shale, the nation's most prolific natural gas formation, runs through the western part of the state, according to the Energy Information Administration. In 2021, natural gas generated more than 45% of the New York's electricity, making it the largest source of statewide power by far.

Vermont, Washington and Maryland have also banned fracking. However, Vermont has no fossil energy reserves while Washington and Maryland have few reserves of their own.

The proposal, included in a $433 billion tax and climate bill, would reinstate a 16.4 cents-per-barrel tax on crude oil imports and taxes on imported petroleum products. President Biden has tried three times to reinstate the tax but has been unsuccessful thus far, according to a Fox News analysis.

The Washington-based conservative group Americans for Tax Reform says the tax ""will be paid by consumers in the form of higher gas and energy costs,"" Bloomberg reported.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced an agreement last week on legislation boosting taxes on huge corporations and wealthy individuals, bolstering fossil fuels and climate change efforts and curbing pharmaceutical prices. Overall, it would raise $739 billion over 10 years in revenue and spend $433 billion, leaving over $300 billion to modestly reduce federal deficits. But a Penn Wharton analysis found that the bill would probably increase inflation slightly for its first two years, before possibly reducing inflation later.

BIDEN'S RADICAL SEC AGENDA USES AGENCY TO MANDATE CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION

The tax on imported oil and petroleum products would seemingly break President Biden’s pledge that tax hikes will affect only those Americans earning $400,000 or more per year. Manchin has said the Democratic package honors that pledge. Taxes on oil and petroleum products are usually passed on to consumers in the form of higher energy prices. Energy prices have already broken records during Biden's presidency, and inflation has hit its highest rate in decades.

Manchin told ""The Faulkner Focus"" on Tuesday that an Inflation Reduction Act tax analysis which suggested the bill would raise taxes on nearly all Americans had been ""written by my friends on the Republican"" committee and not done by the whole Joint Committee on Taxation.

FOX Business reached out to JCT Chief of Staff Thomas A. Barthold who said the tax analysis was prepared ""by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.""

""The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation is a nonpartisan staff serving both sides of the Hill and both sides of the aisle. There is not a Republican staff. There is not a Democratic staff,"" he said.

A spokesperson for Manchin told FOX Business that Republicans on the Committee ""released a partial analysis of one portion of the bill to advance a partisan agenda that does not accurately reflect the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act on average Americans.""

SOARING INFLATION DRIVES MORE AMERICANS TO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK DESPITE 5.1% INCREASE IN WAGES

Manchin is one of Congress' most conservative and contrarian Democrats. He has spent over a year forcing his party to trim its economic proposals, citing inflation fears starkly, and his compromise with Schumer last week shocked colleagues who'd given up hope that he would agree to such a wide-ranging measure.

Manchin has asserted the bill's imposition of a 15% minimum tax on corporations earning over $1 billion annually is not a tax increase. He says it closes loopholes such companies use to escape paying the current 21% corporate tax.

Republicans mocked that reasoning and said its tax boosts would weaken the economy and kill jobs. They cited a report from Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that said about half of the corporate minimum tax would hit manufacturing firms.

""So in the middle of a supply chain crisis, Democrats want huge job-killing tax hikes that will disproportionately crush American manufacturing and manufacturing jobs,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Schumer said he expected votes to begin this week in the Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris could cast the tie-breaking vote to assure its passage. The narrowly divided House has left town for an August recess, but Democratic leaders have said they would bring lawmakers back for a vote, perhaps next week.

The Phillips auction continued the art market’s hot streak over two weeks of sales that has seen record prices for works like the ""Shot Sage Blue Marilyn"" and an iconic Man Ray photograph. Buoyed by the art market’s recent strength and Basquiat’s international appeal, Phillips headed into the sale with a measure of confidence, giving the work featuring a devilish figure a $70 million estimate.

But its success hinged in part on selling several pieces by Pablo Picasso and others to guarantors who only had to place single bids to win.

Market watchers pay attention to the number of bidders who compete for works at the priciest levels because thin bidding can hint at potential cracks in collector confidence. On Wednesday, two bidders vied for the Basquiat—so that could indicate collectors still crave his work at a broad level. The work’s wall-spanning size may also have played a role in its appeal.

MARILYN MONROE'S DRESSES FROM POPULAR MOVIES UP FOR AUCTION

Increasingly, millennial collectors are starting to champion a fresh slate of artists born long after Basquiat died in 1988. These include Anna Weyant, whose 2021 ""Buffet II"" sold to a telephone bidder in Hong Kong for $730,800 over its $150,000 high estimate. Another auction newcomer this season, María Berrío’s 2013 ""Burrow of the Yellow,"" also sold for $998,000 over its estimate of $400,000 to $600,000.

U.S. employers unexpectedly added 528,000 jobs in July, the Labor Department said Friday, a surprisingly strong gain that defied fears of a slowdown in labor markets as they confront scorching-hot inflation and rising interest rates. Wage growth also accelerated, surging by 0.5% in the one-month period from June.

CELEB CHEF GUY FIERI TAKES HIS CHICKEN JOINTS TO COUNTRY MUSIC’S CAPITAL

How much money does Guy Fieri make from television?

Last year, the chef reportedly signed an $80 million contract with the Food Network to host his two shows over the course of a three-year period. The new deal is a $30 million raise from Fieri's prior deal of $50 million, according to Forbes.

Fieri rakes in approximately $26 million per year, which is more than his competitor celebrity chefs such as Emeril Lagasse, who was paid $8 million, and Gordon Ramsay, who earned around $20 million last year. His signature show, ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dive"" first aired in 2006 and, after 33 seasons, earned more than $230 million in advertising revenue in 2020.

""I got a chance of a lifetime,"" Fieri told the Hollywood Reporter in the wake of the deal. ""I think I played it good.""

How did Guy Fieri rise to fame?

The $80 million deal represents a new level of success for Fieri who for most of his career was looked down upon by other celebrity chefs for his humble origins and simple tastes. Fieri started in the food industry at 10 years old and sold pretzels out of a stand. In France, he studied cooking and later moved to Las Vegas to attend the University of Nevada for hospitality management.

In 2006, Fieri was able to host his own show on the Food Network after winning in the second season of ""Next Food Network Star."" The show, ""Guy's Big Bite, only lasted for six episodes and Fieri earned approximately $1,000 per episode.

The show follows Fieri on the road across the United States, Canada, and Mexico as he eats unique foods from popular local diners, drive-in restaurants, and dive bars.

By 2019, Fieri, along with the late Julia Child, became the fourth celebrity chef to be awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has been featured in more than 14 series on the Food Network.

The segment really got started after World War 2 when the Willys ""Jeep"" became a civilian and gave Americans an affordable new way to enjoy the great outdoors.

It was followed by more vehicles from the Jeep brand and the likes of International Harvester Scout and Ford Bronco in the 1960s, the latter of which was first to adopt the ""Sports-Utility Vehicle"" description in its marketing.

More refined models were added to the mix with and started getting used as family cars, then AMC changed the game by turning the Concord car into the four-wheel-drive Eagle in 1981.

MORE AUTO NEWS FROM FOXBUSINESS.COM

The Toyota Rav4 kicked the crossover craze into gear in the 1990s while the cool factor of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ford Explorer lured people away from sedans, station wagons and minivans by the hundreds of thousands, even if the dirt parking lot at the soccer field was as far as they would ever go off the pavement.

Today, SUVs of all sorts account for over half of the vehicles sold in the U.S., which means they are officially mainstream, so automakers have found a new way to make them fashionable again: By going back to the future.

Aping the continued success of brands like Jeep, Subaru and Land Rover, many companies are turning their street-smart utility vehicles back into off-roaders with new trims that improve their rough road capability, or at least make it look like they do. There is even a minivan along for the ride and the new trend is arriving just as more Americans are getting involved in outdoor activities, driven in part by the coronavirus pandemic.

Here are a few of the latest SUVs aimed at the ""active lifestyle"" customers automakers are looking to appeal to today:

CHEVROLET TRAILBLAZER ACTIV: $27,020

The subcompact Trailblazer Activ is available in front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive and gets tougher styling than the other trims, plus improved ground clearance and designed for more rugged terrain than the rest of the lineup can handle.

Signature dark green upholstery adds a woodsy feel to the Expedition that best lives up to the model's name.

HONDA PASSPORT TRAILSPORT: $44,265

Honda's new TrailSport trim launched on the Passport midsize crossover SUV, but will spread to other Honda SUVs. For now, it's a mostly cosmetic upgrade that includes more aggressive front and rear styling and a slightly wider track for its all-season-tires, but Honda says that later versions will get functional modifications, as well.

TOYOTA SIENNA WOODLAND: $46,835

The SUV may have stolen the minivan's mojo, but the ultimate people carrier is back with a vengeance. The Sienna Woodland comes with a standard hybrid all-wheel-drive system good for 35 mpg and gets the requisite increased ground clearance -- from 6.3 inches to a whopping 6.9 inches -- and redesigned front and rear fascias expected of one of these packages, plus a standard tow hitch and roof racks to help bring along enough gear for the seven passengers inside.

It was a telling indication of how involved and accessible the casino's next president plans to be.

Hired in June as Hard Rock's general manager, Faranca is being boosted to the top job now that current president Joe Lupo is heading to Las Vegas to run the Mirage casino once the company completes its purchase.

INFLATION CAUSE FOR 'CONCERN' AS TRAVEL-RELATED COSTS SOAR: HARD ROCK INTERNATIONAL CHAIRMAN

He's being handed the city's No. 2 casino in terms of money won from in-person gamblers (No. 3 when internet and sports betting money are included); a resort that has upped the city's game in terms of live entertainment.

But Faranca's gaze extends beyond the casino's walls to the city around it: He's been meeting with city officials on safety and cleanliness initiatives, pledges to continue Hard Rock's history of supporting charitable and community groups, and realizes the casino's success or failure rests squarely on the shoulders of its employees.

That's why late on a busy Saturday night, with a million other things to keep track of, he was huddling with the cleaning staff.

""I make it a point to go to pre-shift meetings with all the different departments, to thank them for what they do and connect with them,"" Faranca said.

A Philadelphia native, Faranca began his casino career in Atlantic City as a guest services manager at Harrah's and the Showboat. He worked in general manager roles at Philadelphia's Parx casino, the Palms in Las Vegas and at Maryland Live!, where he also was executive vice president, before joining Hard Rock.

Faranca says he has five core principles he plans to follow in his new job: Be the employer of choice in your market. Deliver exceptional hospitality. Clearly understand your property's strategy. Focus on the community. Have a commitment from ownership.

The casino is considering doing some hotel room and suite upgrades, and plans to diversify its entertainment lineup even more, he said.

Jim Allen, the global chairman of Hard Rock, has long pushed Atlantic City officials to make the city safer and cleaner, and has not hesitated to call them out when he feels conditions are poor. Faranca has already picked up that baton.

HARD ROCK INTERNATIONAL CHAIRMAN WARNS ECONOMIC CHALLENGES 'IN FRONT OF US ARE REAL'

""I hope everyone rallies behind the idea of a safe and clean Atlantic City,"" he said. ""When guests visit the city, they need a safe visit.""

He has already had discussions with City Councilman Kaleem Shabazz about the need for safety and cleanliness in the city, and will serve on the board of the Atlantic City Police Department Foundation.

""He is very sincere and open to working with government,"" Shabazz said. ""He seems to have a good sense of how a partnership should go and what issues in the community should be dealt with. I feel a strong sense of his community engagement.""

Lupo, the outgoing Hard Rock president, called Faranca ""a great guy, smart, with great experience. I could not be more pleased.""

His advice for his successor?

""Strong leadership is critical,"" Lupo said. ""Follow the direction of CEO Jim Allen, work compassionately and collaboratively with our wonderful Hard Rock team and the Atlantic City community, and even greater success will follow.""

With Hard Rock surging in the market, the question has been raised: Can it surpass the Borgata to become Atlantic City's top-performing casino?

Faranca smiles and refers to his five business principles.

Wagner, a Hall of Fame shortstop who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates in the early 1900s, was said to be upset that his likeness was being used on a tobacco product. He refused American Tobacco Co.’s request to use his image, which led to the company ceasing production of his card.

The actual contract he signed went up for auction on Goldin and was sold for $180,000, including the buyer’s premium. The auction ended Saturday night.

""This is a truly historic item and is like no other contract ever offered. This contract comes with a letter of provenance from Dennis Gilbert, stating that ‘I have been in possession of this contract since 1993 and guarantee this is Bobby Bonilla's original copy,’"" the description read.

The winner of the auction, who wasn’t revealed, will also receive a few other prizes as well, including a chance to spend the day with Bonilla, get breakfast with him, watch a Mets game and have dinner with him. The winner also receives a 30-minue Zoom call with Bonilla and Gilbert, who brokered the deal, a signed baseball from Bonilla’s collection, a game-used Bonilla bat and a 1/1 Bobby Bonilla contract NFT.

The winner will spend time with Bonilla some time next year.

Bonilla was a six-time All-Star and won a World Series with the Florida Marlins in 1997. He joined the Mets for his first stint in 1991 and was traded in July 1995 to the Baltimore Orioles. The Marlins signed Bonilla in 1996, traded him to the Los Angeles Dodgers in May 1998, and he was traded back to the Mets six months later.

Toward the end of his final stint with the Mets, the two parties agreed on a contract buyout in 2000. New York still owed the slugger $5.9 million and agreed to pay him $1.1 million in annual installments from 2011 until 2035.

When factoring in a pre-negotiated 8% interest rate, the Mets owe Bonilla about $1.19 million every year on July 1. Bonilla, who hasn’t played in the major leagues since the 2001 season, will keep earning money from the Mets until he’s 72 years old.

Griner, who has been in Russian custody since February, was classified as ""wrongfully detained"" by the United States government in May.

President Biden reacted following the news, saying the government will ""pursue every possible avenue"" in order to bring Griner back to the U.S.

""Today, American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney. It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends and teammates. My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible,"" Biden said.

The reason for Griner’s presence in Russia in the first place was monetary.

Griner, who plays for the Phoenix Mercury, is similar to many WNBA players in that she chooses to play overseas during the offseason in order to supplement her salary.

The FBI’s decision to execute a search warrant at former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home on Monday is ""unprecedented"" – especially for a non-sitting commander-in-chief and one who has indicated he might run again, a former special-agent-in-charge told Fox News Digital on Monday.

""We just haven’t investigated presidents after they’ve served their term,"" Michael Tabman, former head of the FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office, said. ""But it is a huge move by the FBI in that the political sensitivities are clear. It's obvious that they're dealing on a very, sort of tenuous political climate when you go out and you investigate a president, especially one who says he may run for office again.""

Trump announced on Monday that his palatial Florida residence had been raided early in the morning. Sources told Fox News Digital the search was in connection with materials that Trump took with him from his time as president. Sources also said National Archives and Records Administration referred the case to the Justice Department, which recovered 15 boxes of classified materials from the home.

But Tabman, who is now retired and not involved in the FBI’s investigation into Trump, noted that securing a search warrant ""is no minor task.""

After former President Trump 's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida was raided by FBI agents, Republicans are slamming the Biden administration and accusing the Department of Justice of ""political weaponization,"" while Democrats are lauding the agency for holding Trump accountable for ""wrongdoing.""

""The raid of MAL is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves,"" said Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. ""Now the Regime is getting another 87k IRS agents to wield against its adversaries? Banana Republic.""

Multiple sources tell Fox News the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago is related to the materials Trump allegedly brought to his private residence after his presidency concluded. That matter was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy issued a warning to Attorney General Merrick Garland that extensive oversight by Republicans in Congress will be heading his way.

""Attorney General Garland: preserve your documents and clear your calendar,"" wrote McCarthy.

South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem blasted Biden's FBI, calling the agency's actions ""un-American"" in a statement posted to Twitter Monday evening.

""The FBI raid on President Trump’s home is an unprecedented political weaponization of the Justice Department. They’ve been after President Trump as a candidate, as President, and now as a former President. Using the criminal justice system in this manner is un-American,"" wrote Noem.

""Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before. After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said Monday.

""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System , and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections,"" the former president continued.

However, ""Squad"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said the FBI is working toward ""accountability"" and went as far as to say Trump should be in prison.

""That’s what happens when you break the law, try to steal an election, and incite a deadly insurrection. Donald Trump should be in jail. I’m glad to see the FBI taking steps towards accountability.""

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., called Trump's statement ""defensive"" during an MSNBC segment Monday.

""But look, the FBI doesn't just go in unless a judge signs off on a search warrant. That means they have some probable evidence about possible wrongdoing. And it's something that the whole country needs to pay attention to and shows that Justice Garland, Attorney General Garland is setting this up step by step,"" he stated.

""I think Attorney General Garland and the Justice Department have done a very good job by following the facts,"" he said. ""I do think that this gives me confidence that the Justice Department is really pursuing this thoroughly, objectively and in a nonpolitical way,"" Khanna continued.

Congressional Republicans also took to Twitter, criticizing the FBI's ""unprecedented"" raid.

""The only thing missing from the unprecedented FBI raid at President Trump’s home is Muammar Gaddafi’s sunglasses and cap on Joe Biden,"" wrote Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.

Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., asked on Twittter: ""What does the FBI know about Hunter Biden?""

GOP Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana mentioned the $739 billion Manchin-Schumer bill that just passed the senate, which expanded the IRS, in his rebuke of the FBI's action.

""If the FBI can raid the home of a former US President, imagine what 87,000 more IRS agents will do to you,"" he quipped on Twitter.

South Carolina Senator Tim Scott echoed Banks' sentiment on Mark Levin's radio show.

""Biden is dividing our country and the DOJ seems to be reinforcing that division through their actions… that is very dangerous to the everyday person walking on the streets of America,"" Scott said to Levin on Monday night.

""We must have 100% confidence and trust in our justice system,"" the Republican senator added. ""And if they can target a former president, you know, they could target me and you.""

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel called the raid ""outrageous.""

""Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Countless times we have examples of Democrats flouting the law and abusing power with no recourse, including Hunter Biden. Democrats continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans. This raid is outrageous,"" she wrote on Twitter.

Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority.

FIRST ON FOX: Veteran political strategists James Carville and Ed Rollins aren't quite seeing eye to eye on the political impact the FBI's raid on former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home could have on the midterm elections.

Speaking with Fox News Digital Tuesday, Carville, who was an adviser to former President Bill Clinton, said there wasn't enough information about the raid to know just yet what it could mean for voters heading to the polls.

But Rollins, a Republican, predicted the event could end up being the ""biggest issue in the midterms.""

""The attorney general and the FBI need to explain to the American public what they were doing and why,"" Rollins, an adviser to former President Ronald Reagan, said when asked about the raid.

ERIC TRUMP GIVES CLEAREST INDICATION YET OF POSSIBLE TRUMP 2024 RUN FOLLOWING FBI RAID

""This is an invasion of a man's home … and the public has a right to know why.""

He added that Trump had a right to know if he was being suspected of committing a crime and that it was his right to defend himself.

""To argue they are gathering evidence is not good enough. Trump not only is a former president, but certainly is the front-runner for a future nomination and possible re-election,"" Rollins said.

""This could become the biggest issue in the midterms, and the ruthless abuse of power could overcome all else. It has already stepped on all other news that Biden and his team wanted to promote on his legislative record,"" Rollins added.

He was referring to the passage of a number of Democrat-backed legislative priorities being overshadowed by news of the raid.

Carville took a different tone, appearing more hesitant to say the Mar-a-Lago raid would play a central role either way in upcoming elections.

He did, however, warn ""right-wing"" media personalities and commentators to ""tread very carefully"" in criticizing the raid, arguing that the documents and data the FBI had to justify the raid were likely ""substantial.""

When asked how he thought it might affect voters' decisions as they head to the polls in November, Carville said, ""We don't know because we have to find out more facts.""

Carville then argued that if Trump's claims that the raid was political were true, then he should make the search warrant public.

""I can't imagine that that search warrant said anything less than something just overwhelming. And if it's not, then Trump can make it public,"" he said.

The White House said Tuesday that President Biden and White House staff learned of the FBI’s unprecedented raid on former President Trump’s home at Mar-a-Lago through public reports ""just like the American people did,"" and stressed Biden's commitment to Justice Department investigations ""free of political influence.""

Trump’s private residence in Palm Beach, Florida, was raided by the FBI Monday morning, when the former president was in New York City. The raid was connected to an investigation into classified records Trump allegedly took with him from the White House to his home when he left office in January 2021.

When asked whether Biden or any White House officials were aware of the raid or had been briefed, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said they were not.

FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland were aware of the raid, per standard protocol, and would have been fully briefed on it, a source told Fox News.

An FBI source confirmed to Fox News that FBI agents who conducted the raid were from Washington, D.C., and were on the bureau's Evidence Response Team. The agents notified the Miami Field Office just before the raid.

A source familiar told Fox News that agents brought a ""safe cracker"" and cracked a ""relatively new"" safe in Mar-a-Lago. The source told Fox News there was ""nothing in it.""

A source familiar told Fox News that FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago and looked in every single office and safe, and grabbed documents and boxes without going through them on the property. They took boxes and documents to go through them later.

""They were not being judicious about what they took,"" the source told Fox News.

Trump made the raid public Monday evening, saying in a lengthy statement that ""nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.""

""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said. ""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections.""

""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before,"" Trump said.

""I'm here to talk about the flood and recovery from the flood,"" McConnell, R-Ky., said when asked about the raid.

McConnell was in his home state after floods recently hit the eastern part of his state, killing dozens. President Biden and Jill Biden even visited the state Monday in the wake of the natural disaster.

The minority leader's refusal to talk about the search warrant served on Trump's private home comes as Senate GOP leadership has been slower than their House counterparts to comment on the raid.

Trump announced on Monday that his palatial Florida residence had been raided. Sources told Fox News Digital the search was in connection with materials that Trump took with him from his time as president. Sources also said National Archives and Records Administration referred the case to the Justice Department, which recovered 15 boxes of classified materials from the home.

Bob Barnes, the man who has been cycling to all 50 U.S. state capitals in one year, spotted two major landmarks while he was riding through South Dakota and North Dakota recently.

But beyond that, happy memories of his positive interactions with residents of these states and his experiences in both states have stayed with him.

Barnes, 52, of Syracuse, N.Y., reached his 43rd capital, Pierre, on May 27. He arrived at capital no. 44, Bismarck, on June 2. Amid his journey through the two states, Barnes said he experienced historic sites, a memorable meal and ""jaw-dropping"" scenery at a national park.

NY MAN CYCLING ACROSS AMERICA HITS SC, REVEALS THE ONE RELIGIOUS SYMBOL HE'S SEEN NATIONWIDE

Here are more specifics of what he saw as he neared the end of his all-American biking trip — and why these experiences stood out for him.

'Every single person is friendly'

Barnes arrived in South Dakota on May 24.

The very next day, he rode through the city of De Smet, where the Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Homes are located.

Wilder, an American author, wrote the ""Little House on the Prairie"" book series. She and her family lived in De Smet for several years.

Barnes said he had no idea Wilder's home was in De Smet until he noticed signs three blocks away.

""I was like, ‘Wow that is really cool,’"" Barnes told Fox News Digital. ""That was the real deal. That was a nice experience.""

Overall, Barnes said he loved his time in South Dakota.

""I think South Dakota was the friendliest overall state that I’ve been through,"" he said.

""Every single person is friendly. Everybody’s in a good mood, and it’s actually catching.""

Barnes said everyone he met during his time there waved at him and said hello.

""They just come up and talk to you,"" Barnes said.

""I’ve had more people come up and talk to me in South Dakota than any other state.""

""It’s awesome,"" he added. ""It’s fun … I just soak it in.""

Barnes pointed out that while he was cycling, he didn't come across many people on the road — and that, at times, he felt ""a little lonely.""

""But you just keep going,"" he said. ""You know where the next town is and you just get to it.""

Barnes said he had one of his best weeks of riding through South Dakota, reaching 433 miles in one week.

""That was really cool,"" Barnes said. ""That was a confidence booster. I know now what I have physically and I’m even more confident I’ll get [the trip] done.""

It helped that the terrain wasn’t so bad — and that drivers gave Barnes a lot of space on the road.

""South Dakota was kind of flawless,"" Barnes said about his ride.

""We did a lot of miles in South Dakota, but we got in, we got out,"" he said, referring to himself and his set of wheels. ""It was a very efficient ride through South Dakota.""

American state with ‘the best scenery'

Barnes arrived in North Dakota on May 30.

Just before reaching his 44th capital of Bismarck, on June 2, Barnes donated platelets — something he's been doing at various points along his journey as he works to raise awareness about the importance of donating blood and helping others.

""That was the first time I did my donation and visited a capital [in the same day], so that’s like a home run,"" Barnes said of his accomplishment.

Barnes said his platelet donation went well.

""They treated me like a celebrity — I get a little embarrassed when that happens,"" he added.

""They actually bought me food,"" Barnes said.

""They bought me Famous Dave’s. They bought me a brisket sandwich and that was good.""

Barnes also got to enjoy a tasty meal of chicken and dumplings at a restaurant called The Grill in Linton, North Dakota.

""It was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life,"" Barnes said.

""I’ve never had dumplings before.""

On his way out of the state, Barnes saw the Badlands, the landforms in western North Dakota.

""That was fantastic,"" Barnes said. ""That was some of the best scenery in the entire country.""

He continued, ""That was definitely a high point and a surprise. It just came out of nowhere and it was … jaw-dropping.""

Barnes even came across a herd of wild mustangs. ""They were beautiful,"" he said. ""Just so cool.""

While he was in North Dakota, Barnes went through his belongings to prepare for the final part of his trip, he said.

He threw away his two camping chairs, his dress clothes and shoes, three broken cellphones — and extra tent items like poles, covers and stakes.

He also collected all his loose change, which he said weighed about two pounds. He planned to use the change at a nearby store.

""I intently went to a convenience store and I was going to buy some scratch-off tickets and give them to the clerk just to be a nice person,"" Barnes explained.

""But they don’t sell scratch-offs in North Dakota.""

Later, Barnes left behind his trailer — which carried most of his belongings — and instead packed everything in his saddlebags attached to his bike.

Barnes said he left his trailer and hammock behind, along with a note saying the items were free for the taking.

Barnes did keep his French press, his stove, some clothes, his sandals and his solar panel, which helps him charge his phone.

Leaving his trailer behind, he said, ""made a remarkable difference.""

""I’ll never pull a trailer again,"" he said.

Next stop: Treasure State

After Bob Barnes left North Dakota on June 4, he arrived in Montana, heading for capital no. 45 on his trip: Helena.

After visiting all of the Lower 48 states, he took a ferry to Juneau, Alaska, from Canada and rode on his bicycle to the capitol — as he previously shared with Fox News Digital that he would be doing.

From there, he flew with his bike to Hawaii and rode from the airport to the capitol building to complete his trip.

The Statue of Liberty, perhaps the most celebrated symbol of American ideals and exceptionalism, reopened after the 9/11 attacks on this day in history, August 3, 2004.

The globally recognized landmark had been closed to the public for nearly three years following the destruction of the nearby World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.

Lady Liberty stood stoically watching over the horror in Lower Manhattan that day, little more than a mile across New York Harbor.

""This beacon of hope and liberty is once again open to the public, sending a reassuring message to the world that freedom is alive in New York and shining brighter than ever before,"" said then-Gov. George Pataki, as he reopened the Statue of Liberty along with Michael Bloomberg, NYC's then-mayor, plus the Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton, other officials and members of the public.

The celebration featured pomp and circumstance, including a performance of ""You're a Grand Old Flag"" and the national anthem by a military choir.

But the event also came amid concerns about terror attacks that loomed over the nation long after 9/11. New York City, nearby Newark, N.J. and Washington, D.C., all faced terror threats in the days before the reopening ceremony.

""I think it shows the world that liberty cannot be intimidated,"" Craig Manson, assistant interior secretary, said before the festivities.

Lady Liberty's interior metal framework was fabricated by Gustave Eiffel, who immediately afterward began building the iconic tower in Paris that bears his name.

The Statue of Liberty has been shuttered for various reasons through its history.

It was closed for two years from 1984 to 1986 for extensive restoration work before its centennial celebration.

The Statue of Liberty closed again to the public for four months at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, before a phased period of reopening began in July.

Visitors could access the statue's famous torch for the first 30 years of its existence.

But public access to the torch was ended following the deadly ""Black Tom explosion"" of July 30, 1916.

The Statue of Liberty's torch was among the structures damaged by explosion fragments.

As the U.S. contemplated entry into World War I, German spies sabotaged a barge in New York Harbor filled with an estimated 2 million pounds of arms and munitions destined for Allies in Europe. The horrific explosion could be felt as far away as Philadelphia.

Talk about crushing the competition.

Lat 35 Racing's first all-female rowing team took on the biennial Great Pacific Race, challenging rowers to cross 2,400 nautical miles of Pacific Ocean from San Francisco, Calif., to Waikiki, Hawaii, as fast as possible.

The Lat 35 ladies — Libby Costello, Sophia Denison-Johnston, Brooke Downes and Adrienne Smith — crushed the competition.

They also set a global best for female contenders.

The women finished the race in 34 days, 14 hours and 11 minutes, breaking the previous record by 24 hours.

Lat 35 partnered with the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) to raise money and awareness for mental health throughout the journey.

The team surpassed its goal of $10,000 — raising $12,083 for the cause as of current.

Teammate Brooke Downes shared the experience in an interview with Fox News Digital, repeating the team’s mission statement which was to ""get to Hawaii as fast as possible.""

""So that’s what we did,"" she said.

The rower revealed how breaking the record was, at times, questionable.

She admitted that her confidence in expecting to break the record might have been ""naïve,"" given that conditions on the water were so unpredictable.

""The last couple of days we had really terrible conditions and our expected time of arrival just kept getting pushed back later and later,"" she said.

The team left San Francisco on June 21 — and arrived in Waikiki on Monday, July 25.

""But the last day, we knew that we were going to break a world record. It just came down to a matter of by how much.""

The team left San Francisco on June 21 — and arrived in Waikiki on Monday, July 25.

Besides hitting rocky waters at the tail end of the voyage, Downes remembered moving ""terribly slow"" about two weeks into the race due to the wind conditions.

This slow movement lasted for about five days in intense heat.

""That was kind of a point where, for me, I saw the opportunity to break the overall record kind of go away, which was just really disappointing,"" she said.

""More fun than I could have ever expected to have.""

""There was one day that the conditions were perfect for us to jump in the water and swim,"" she added.

""That was a really special day for us to all be together, swimming in this spot off land [where] probably no other human has ever been.""

HOW TO EXERCISE DURING A WORK TRIP AND STAY FIT WHILE TRAVELING

Downes expressed feeling ""grateful"" for her teammates’ support on nights when conditions were rough and sometimes outright painful physically.

Each teammate rowed for two hours on and two hours off to balance adequate sleep — and to allow the team members to manage other tasks, such as preparing freeze-dried meals and handling boat maintenance.

The crew made 25 liters of purified water per day, through a pressurized system and solar energy — which they used to drink, cook, rinse off and clean their clothes.

""Every single day brings something new,"" she said.

""It’s pretty amazing how much you can fit in the boat,"" she said. ""But you didn't bring anything that you didn't need.""

Downes detailed how each woman only brought enough clothes to satisfy every weather condition, including rain, intense heat and even cold weather.

""The beginning was very cold,"" she said.

""And extra-cold because we would have to put on the same wet clothes to row.""

The women encountered other obstacles on the water, such as being hit by flying fish. Also, the boat’s rudder was knocked out of place by an unidentified marine animal — sending the boat spinning.

The boat’s bearings also began to corrode halfway through the journey. That was caused by different metals being mixed into the wheels.

New Jersey-born Downes, who graduated from the University of Southern California in 2019, described the journey as ""the best decision"" she’s ever made as a rower of more than 10 years.

""I was really curious,"" she said.

""I wanted to know what it was like to be out in the middle of the ocean with nobody around … during this huge, incredible race.""

""I love rowing, and I want to row even more now.""

The rower said there was ""nothing stopping"" her except fear, so teammate Libby Costello — a longtime friend of Downes — invited her to join the Lat 35 crew.

Downes accepted the offer, quit her job and moved to Santa Barbara to begin training.

""I thought, I can either watch that whole experience and wish that I was doing it with her — or I can actually do it with her,"" she said.

""And it was the best decision I’ve made.""

Downes, who was training for the National Rowing Team prior to the race, is aspiring to qualify for the Olympics in 2024, but said she’ll be taking some time to recuperate first.

""I love rowing, and I want to row even more now,"" she said.

Several Democrats who supported the raid of former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate Monday previously criticized him for allegedly trying to ""weaponize"" the Justice Department on a number of different issues.

In a September 2019 tweet, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., accused Trump of trying to ""weaponize"" the Justice Department after it began investigating automakers who had reached a deal with California regarding fuel efficiency standards.

""The Department of Justice’s frivolous investigation of automakers who reached an agreement with California on new fuel efficiency standards is an effort to weaponize law enforcement for partisan political purposes,"" Pelosi wrote. ""This sham investigation must end now.""

HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO MEET WITH TRUMP AT BEDMINSTER, FOLLOWING MAR-A-LAGO FBI RAID

In May 2019, California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, now a member of the House select committee to investigate the January 6th Capitol protest, lashed out at Trump and former Attorney General William Barr as he accused them both of trying to ""conspire"" with one another in an attempt to gather information ""against their political enemies.""

""While Trump stonewalls the public from learning the truth about his obstruction of justice, Trump and Barr conspire to weaponize law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies,"" Schiff wrote in a tweet at the time. ""The coverup has entered a new and dangerous phase. This is un-American.""

Similarly, two years later, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., accused Barr of acting as Trump's ""personal henchman"" following a report that claimed the DOJ secretly subpoenaed records for two Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.

""This is an EXTREME and dangerous abuse of power,"" Jayapal wrote. ""It is wholly unacceptable to weaponize the DOJ against members of Congress. Bill Barr consistently acted as Trump's personal henchman, and he must be held fully accountable for his actions.""

Earlier this year, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., one of seven Democrats serving on the nine-member January 6 committee panel, said Trump tried to ""weaponize"" the DOJ in an attempt ""to retain power.""

""Today @January6thCmte will expose how Donald Trump tried to weaponize the Department of Justice in his desperate bid to retain power,"" Raskin wrote. ""Watch at 3pm ET as witnesses, including the former Acting Attorney General, reveal how Trump nearly made the Big Lie DOJ policy.""

Despite the Trump-era accusations made by the House Democrats, the party, overall, is now silent or lauding the Justice Department after Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida was raided by FBI agents on Monday.

Pelosi said Tuesday she believed the FBI must have ""justification"" for the raid.

""All I know about that is what is in the public domain. I was surprised that it flashed on my phone last evening, so I don't really have too much to say except that to have a visit like that, you need a warrant. To have a warrant, you need justification. And that says that no one is above the law, not even a president or a former president of the United States,"" Pelosi told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

Raskin, during an appearance on MSNBC, also responded briefly to the raid at Mar-a-Lago, insisting that Americans have an ""interest"" in the rule of law.

""The great thing about the separation of powers is we knew nothing about that,"" Raskin said. ""We don't know whether that's something related to what we're working on or not...""

""Everybody in America, and speaking as a citizen, we all have an interest in the rule of law in the country and respect for the rule of law, and resistance to the lawlessness that seems to be always out there,"" he added.

In a tweet issued Monday after the raid was made public, Jayapal sang a different tune as she claimed the FBI is taking steps toward ""accountability"" and suggested that Trump should be in prison.

""That’s what happens when you break the law, try to steal an election, and incite a deadly insurrection,"" she wrote. ""Donald Trump should be in jail. I’m glad to see the FBI taking steps towards accountability.""

Multiple sources tell Fox News the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago is related to the materials Trump allegedly brought to his private residence after his presidency concluded. That matter was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority.

Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., said the unprecedented FBI raid at former President Donald Trump’s residence at Mar-a-Lago is not the first ""October surprise"" carried out by the agency on behalf of Democrats, noting the timing of the arrests in the alleged kidnapping plot targeting Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

""The same FBI that cooked up a plot to kidnap governors before an election just raided Biden’s most likely challenger,"" Bishop tweeted on Monday evening amid breaking news of the Mar-a-Lago raid. ""Democrats are cheering on the weaponization of law enforcement against political opponents. They don’t care about ‘democracy’: just crushing their enemies.""

Bishop joined other GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee in demanding U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray urgently testify regarding the Trump raid.

In a follow-up tweet on Tuesday, Bishop noted that jury selection has begun in the re-trial of two of the four men charged in federal court in connection to an alleged kidnapping plot targeting Whitmer in October 2020 allegedly over disgust with the Democrat’s lockdown restrictions.

TRUMP FBI RAID: HILLARY CLINTON APPEARS TO FUNDRAISE OFF MAR-A-LAGO SEARCH

In April, a federal jury could not reach a verdict for Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr., but two other co-defendants, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta, were found not guilty and acquitted on all charges.

Defense attorneys had accused the FBI of entrapment, painting their clients of marijuana-smoking weekend warriors, rather than domestic extremists weeded out by an FBI informant.

""As the retrial begins for 2 of the accused in the FBI Whitmer plot, remember: Arrests were announced on Oct. 8th, 2020, during early voting. A perfect October surprise,"" Bishop tweeted Tuesday. ""If you're still inclined to give the FBI the benefit of the doubt here, think again.""

Bishop shared a link to a story by The Wall Street Journal outlining how the two acquitted men in the alleged Whitmer kidnapping plot could pose an uphill battle for prosecutors during the retrial, noting how a former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan admitted that the ""big question is, did the FBI arrest these defendants too quickly, before they gathered enough evidence.""

Bishop wrote about the case in a recent op-ed for North State Journal. The congressman pointed out how during a recent hearing hosted by the House Judiciary Committee, he questioned Matthew Olsen, assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice’s National Security Division.

""I questioned Mr. Olsen about a disturbing trend emerging in the DOJ’s efforts to detect and thwart domestic terrorism plots. Specifically, weeks before the 2020 election, the FBI announced it had foiled an alleged plot to kidnap the Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer. Two years later, the story is quite different,"" Bishop said, noting how two of the men charged were acquitted on grounds of entrapment and the jury was hung on the two others.

""It is clear from the current evidence that federal agents cooked up this operation, trained recruits to carry out the FBI’s plan, directed recruitment efforts, and incentivized the informants with handsome paydays in order to keep the plot moving forward – all on the taxpayers’ dime,"" Bishop wrote. ""It leaves an important question: Is this how the DOJ carries its operations?""

""That’s why I questioned AAG Olsen about the way the DOJ is carrying out its business,"" the congressman said. ""He refused to answer important questions, including: Why did the DOJ announce the case so close to the 2020 election? How much did it cost? The American people deserve answers."""

Senior Senate Republicans, who have themselves reacted only gradually, Tuesday demanded that the FBI immediately release information about its raid of former President Trump's Florida estate, which they are calling a major law enforcement escalation against a former president.

The statements, from GOP Conference Chair John Barrasso, R-Wyo., Vice Conference Chair Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Rick Scott, R-Fla., come as top Senate Republicans overall have been slower to comment on the raid than their counterparts in House GOP leadership.

Vermont voters will choose candidates Tuesday to fill a seat in the U.S. Senate that has been occupied since 1975 by retiring Democratic U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the last of Congress's so-called Watergate babies, elected after the resignation of former President Richard Nixon.

The leading Democratic candidate to run for Leahy's seat in the November election is U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, a liberal Democrat known for working across the aisle. Welch has held his House seat since 2007. During the years he has been in Congress, Welch has been one of Vermont's top vote getters and would be an odds-on favorite to win the general election.

Vermont's former U.S. Attorney Christina Nolan and retired U.S. Army officer Gerald Malloy are the two leading candidates vying for the Republican Party nomination for the November election.

Both Nolan and Malloy believe they can win the seat. Vermont is considered by many to be one of the most liberal states in country. No Republican has represented the state in Washington since 2001 when the late Sen. Jim Jeffords left the GOP to become an independent, switching control of the Senate from Republican to Democratic.

Redic says that if elected she would focus on fighting inflation, illegal immigration, drug misuse and government overreach, particularly as it concerns vaccine mandates.

Madden, a non-traditional candidate in the Republican primary, says he's an independent. He said he had thought of declining the nomination if he wins, until he learned that would allow the party to choose a replacement for the November ballot.

The Vermont primary will also choose the nominees for governor.

Vermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott, of Berlin — a one-time stock car driver and the GOP's lone statewide officeholder — is seeking his party's nomination to run for reelection in November.

Elected to his first two-year term as governor in 2016, Scott has focused his time in office on making Vermont more affordable and working to attract more people to the state to counter a demographic trend of an aging population with a shrinking workforce and fewer school-age children.

He is facing two little-known candidates in the primary.

The lone candidate for the Democratic nomination is activist Brenda Siegel, of Newfane. Last fall she spent 27 nights sleeping on the steps of the Vermont Statehouse to highlight the state's homelessness challenge."

There is simply no question, by any objective standard, that Joe Biden is on a hot streak.

After many months of muddled messaging and plummeting polls, the president has pushed through a raft of important legislation, culminating with a sweeping climate change/health care/corporate taxes measure that will win final approval this week. Some of the bills passed with strong bipartisan support. And it’s been just over a week since the president announced that on his orders, a drone strike had killed the leader of al Qaeda.

But all this may have little impact on Biden’s attempt to rally his party behind him in seeking a second term. The media narrative against him – that he’s too old, too slow, and that most Democrats want a younger candidate – could be too powerful to alter, baked into the midterm cake.

That may be unfair to Biden, who now has a stronger slate of legislative accomplishments than any president in decades, but life is unfair. He would be 82 at the next inauguration and too many of his voters – along with Democratic lawmakers – seem ready to give him a gold watch and a hearty sendoff.

BEHIND THE KANSAS ABORTION SHOCKER : WHY SOME RED STATES DON'T WANT A TOTAL BAN

Imagine a football team that goes 2-7, with growing calls to fire the coach, and then wins its last 7 games to pull out a winning record. Does the strong finish erase the memory of its earlier awfulness?

Keep in mind that journalists worship polls. If Biden were suddenly to get a healthy bump, the media would start doing pieces about his comeback, easing fears among fellow Democrats that he will drag his party down in 2022 and be a weak candidate two years later. But without that short-term pop, the conventional wisdom remains that inflation (though Biden has brought down gas prices somewhat) will drive a sweeping Republican victory in November.

And then there’s the nature of the climate legislation itself, the dubiously named Inflation Reduction Act. Even Bernie Sanders says it will have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation.

The truth is it will take a while for ordinary folks to feel the effects of the $700-billion bill, and elections are won or lost in the short term.

The measure provides the greatest investment in climate change by a single country, but global warming won’t ease for years, and even the clean-energy funds will have to be awarded and workers hired before anyone’s life is improved.

As the Washington Post points out, the $7,500 credits for buying electric cars only happen if manufacturers displace Chinese batteries by 2024.

Allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices is a long-sought goal, but that will also take some time. The $300 billion in deficit reduction is an important step, but for most Americans the deficit is an abstraction.

Meanwhile, some liberal Democrats can barely hide their dissatisfaction with Biden. In the case of two veteran House members running against each other in a New York district, Jerry Nadler said it’s too early to talk about 2024 and Carolyn Maloney said she doesn’t think Biden’s running (and then apologized by saying she’ll back him if he does but still doesn’t think he will). That is hardly the mark of a strong incumbent.

Rather than trying to hector him out of the race, Maureen Dowd used her New York Times column to appeal to Biden’s sense of history: ""He could leave on a high, knowing that he has delivered on his promises for progress and restored decency to the White House.""

Biden wasted months fighting for on a left-wing fantasy bill whose absurd price tag – $3.5 trillion – meant it would never come close to passing a 50-50 Senate. And while Republicans spent many hours trashing the new bill that they can’t stop because of reconciliation – just as Democrats did with the Trump tax cuts – it’s a far more moderate measure than would spend less than a quarter of the original measure.

Maybe this gives Biden a more solid platform to sell himself as worthy of four more years. But for now there’s a profound disconnect between Biden and his voters on whether the man who first ran for president in 1987 should make one last run."

What happened in Kansas is what the Supreme Court, and defenders of its abortion ruling, say they wanted.

Not the outcome, to be sure: A stunning surge of voters who supported keeping the right to abortion in the state constitution, just a point below the level considered a landslide victory.

But the whole rationale for overturning Roe v. Wade was to take such decisions out of the hands of unelected judges and put them closer to the people, on a state by state basis. Well, in Kansas, a conservative state where Republicans far outnumber Democrats, the people have spoken, with a 59 to 41% declaration.

Now those who are passionately pro-life will keep on fighting, as they have every right to do, just as pro-choicers wouldn’t have given up if they had gotten beaten. This is just one round in the Kansas battle.

HOW POWERHOUSE PERSONALITTIES DRIVE EVERYONE CRAZY - AND OFTEN CHANGE HISTORY

But it serves as a national warning that complete bans on abortion, while inevitable in some red states, are not so easily accomplished. And many Republican lawmakers must have woken up yesterday and wondered whether they need to compromise.

It’s no coincidence that some conservative Republican governors haven’t seized this moment to make abortion totally illegal in their states. Ron DeSantis, who obviously has 2024 ambitions, is sticking with his past position of no abortions after 15 weeks – which might have seemed dramatic a few months ago but is now a middle ground, perhaps better suited to Florida and a White House campaign.

What is fueling the abortion rights side, in my view, is extensive media coverage of the lack of exceptions proposed in some state bans. The Idaho GOP has endorsed the idea of not allowing abortions even if the mother’s life is in danger. And stories about women with serious miscarriages being allowed to bleed for days because the treatment is the same as an abortion haven’t exactly projected an image of compassion.

The rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl who went to Indiana for an abortion, once it was confirmed, provides a graphic case for those who say it is cruel and heartless to force victims to give birth to their rapist’s babies.

Tudor Dixon, who won the GOP nomination for Michigan governor on Tuesday, described a hypothetical 14-year-old girl who is sexually assaulted by her uncle as a ""perfect example"" of someone who should be forced to give birth. Asked if she wanted to soften her remarks, Dixon said, ""I’m not hiding from it.""

These legal battles will play out in all 50 states, and now the Justice Department has joined the fray. DOJ sued over the new Idaho law, saying it violates a federal requirement (for hospitals accepting Medicare) that medical care must be provided when a pregnant woman’s life or health is at stake. Merrick Garland said ""we will use every tool at our disposal"" to ensure such treatment.

President Biden signed an executive order yesterday aiming to protect women who travel out of state for abortions, but its weak language only directs HHS to ""consider"" such action. The travel question is certain to be another front in this legal war.

In Kansas, advocacy groups poured millions into advertising campaigns, with the Catholic Church and other religious groups weighing in on one side and national abortion rights groups on the other.

Turns out the pro-choice side won counties where Donald Trump won big victories last time, making clear there were plenty of Republicans who at least favored allowing abortions with some restrictions.

But that will be up to state legislators, who can still impose a total or near-total ban on abortions.

It was, no question, a victory for America and the world.

The drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahri, the leader of al Qaeda, took out one of the world’s most despicable terrorists, the intellectual force behind the group who, as Usama bin Laden’s number two, helped mastermind the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. And Zawahri pulled off devastating attacks before that, including the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, which prompted the Clinton administration to target him.

It was also a big win for President Biden, and yet no one felt more of a sense of closure than the families of the 9/11 victims. Zawahri was a central plotter for the hijacked airplanes that toppled the World Trade Center, slammed into the Pentagon, and would have struck a third target if not for the bravery of passengers above Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

That utterly transformed our politics for years, plunging us into an age of not bringing liquids on airplanes, passing homeland security laws and waging a 20-year war in Afghanistan.

HOW POWERHOUSE PERSONALITTIES DRIVE EVERYONE CRAZY - AND OFTEN CHANGE HISTORY

This was not a military operation of the kind that killed Usama bin Laden in 2011, with Biden sitting in the famous Situation Room photo as he, President Obama and other leaders waited for the results of the Navy SEAL raid. While officials aren’t saying this publicly, it was a CIA counterterrorism operation. It took another 11 years for Biden to authorize the strike that killed Zawahri on Saturday.

Zawahri’s gray-bearded visage had become familiar to Americans when he took over al Qaeda and made a series of videos to deliver terror messages. It’s true he was past his prime, but this was about accountability.

TRUMP AGAIN DOMINATING THE NEWS, BIDEN'S BLISTERING SPEECH A SIDEBAR

From a White House balcony, where he is still sidelined by COVID-19, Biden told the country: ""Justice has been delivered, and this terrorist leader is no more… We make it clear again tonight that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out.""

Biden deserves credit for the tough call, as some Republicans acknowledged, but this is not going to transform the midterms. It will soon fade from the news with voters remaining focused on inflation, COVID-19 and other domestic issues. Even Obama only got a short-term bump for taking out bin Laden.

Now we come to a more complicated question.

Biden has a strong argument that his approach has been vindicated after he presided over the worst foreign policy debacle in generations, the violent and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. The president said then that the U.S. could conduct counterterrorism missions even without boots on the ground – and the CIA operation proved him right, with reports of no civilian casualties.

But Republicans are taking some shots over the fact that Zawarhi was in Kabul at all. Under the withdrawal deal – negotiated by Donald Trump in 2020, and later accepted by Biden – the Taliban pledged not to harbor any terror organization with international aims.

Is anyone really shocked that the Taliban, which claim to have had no idea of Zawarhi’s presence, are lying? He lived in a luxurious home in a wealthy gated community in the capital, not far from the U.S. Embassy. He returned after the Taliban takeover, let down his guard, and it took our intelligence service months to confirm his presence and his practice of spending time on his balcony, the spot where he was killed – after his family moved to another Kabul home.

Media commentators ranging from Donald Trump's strongest foes to most fervent allies appeared in agreement on one thing Monday: the FBI raid of his Mar-a-Lago home may have handed him the 2024 Republican nomination.

The FBI executed a search warrant of the former president's Florida residence on Monday, stunning the news industry and incensing Trump and his supporters. Sources told Fox News Digital the search was in connection with materials that Trump took with him from his time as president. Sources also said National Archives and Records Administration referred the case to the Justice Department, which recovered 15 boxes of classified materials from the home.

CNN commentator Alyssa Farah Griffin, who served as Trump's White House communications director but is now one of his fiercest critics, fretted on ""New Day"" that an empty-handed raid could send Trump to the White House.

""This, I'm hoping, goes beyond simply not complying with some archiving laws, or [the Department of Justice] just handed Donald Trump the Republican [nomination] and potentially the presidency,"" she said. ""If it's seen as some sort of massive overreach and not something incredibly serious, this is a very good day for Donald Trump.""

Joe Walsh, the ex-GOP congressman who like Farah Griffin evolved from a passionate Trump fan to one of his sharpest media foes, also expressed concern the search of the former president's home may rally his supporters behind the flag.

""Both things are true: 1. The Justice Department’s job is to pursue justice & uphold the rule of law. And they should NEVER let politics get in the way of that. Yesterday, they did their job. 2. What happened yesterday handed the 2024 GOP nomination to Donald Trump,"" he tweeted.

Trump has essentially frozen the 2024 GOP field as he gives hints that he will make a third run for the White House without formally announcing yet. His dramatic statement about the raid said his home had been ""occupied,"" ""raided,"" and was ""under siege"" by the FBI, and it received a strong reaction from his backers.

CNN's Dana Bash said Trump had greatly advanced his short-term political goal of capturing the nomination, saying his language in the statement about the raid was ""kind of genius.""

""It totally triggers and animates the people not only who like him, but there was concern, according to people around Trump, that he had, that he was losing some mojo. He was having some trouble raising money. And this, he believes, would turn it around,"" she said.

2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who has since formed the new Forward Party, worried that the raid would contribute to the depiction of Trump ""against a corrupt government establishment. The raid strengthens that case for millions of Americans who will see this as unjust persecution.""

The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires presidential administrations to preserve certain documents.

Under the law, all White House staff must copy or forward any presidential records created on non-official electronic messaging accounts to their official electronic messaging account within 20 days of leaving office.

According to a 2017 memorandum issued by the White House counsel's office under the Trump administration, ""any employee who intentionally fails to take these actions may be subject to administrative or even criminal penalties.""

Trump, earlier this year, said the National Archives didn’t ""find"" the documents, but that they were ""given, upon request.""

""The National Archives did not ‘find’ anything, they were given, upon request, Presidential Records in an ordinary and routine process to ensure the preservation of my legacy and in accordance with the Presidential Records Act,"" Trump said in a statement at the time, adding that Democrats ""are in search of their next Scam.""

The matter was referred to the Justice Department by NARA.

Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA 'UNDER SIEGE' BY FBI AGENTS

The FBI’s raid of Mar-a-Lago took place early Monday morning, when Trump was in New York City.

An FBI source confirmed that FBI agents from Washington, D.C., who are on the bureau's Evidence Response Team, conducted the raid and notified the Miami Field Office just before.

Per standard protocol, FBI Director Chris Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland were aware of the raid even if shortly before and would have been fully briefed.

A White House official told Fox News it did not have any notice of the reported action and referred all additional questions to the DOJ.

A source familiar told Fox News that agents brought a ""safe cracker"" and cracked a ""relatively new"" safe in Mar-a-Lago. The source told Fox News there was ""nothing in it.""

A source familiar told Fox News that FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago and looked in every single office and safe, and grabbed documents and boxes without going through them on the property. They took boxes and documents to go through them later.

""They were not being judicious about what they took,"" the source told Fox News.

GOP SLAMS 'WEAPONIZATION' OF DOJ AFTER TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RAIDED BY FBI; DEMS CALL IT 'ACCOUNTABILITY'

Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz said FBI agents likely seized documents without inquiring if they were classified, declassified or personal to Trump.

""The Justice Department had no right to seize them indiscriminately because some may not be classified and others may be classified above their level,"" he said. ""There are things that have been declassified by the president, which the Justice Department doesn't know about.""

Dershowitz slammed the unprecedented raid of the former president’s home, and questioned the bureau’s decision to execute a search warrant, rather than issue a subpoena for the records in question.

""There was no reason not to issue a subpoena returnable tomorrow, so that there's no claim that Trump could've destroyed anything,"" Dershowitz told Fox News. ""This should've been a subpoena, not a search warrant.""

He added: ""If it is a search warrant, it has to have a high level of cause demonstrating that the evidence would have been destroyed.""

Legal scholars note that when individuals previously violated the law regarding classified documents, the Justice Department has opted to either not prosecute or settle for lesser charges.

""The Presidential Records Act is not commonly a subject of criminal prosecution, even in the most egregious cases,"" said Jonathan Turley, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. ""These incidents have generally been handled administratively.""

Trump made the raid public Monday evening, saying in a lengthy statement that ""nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.""

""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said. ""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections.""

""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before,"" Trump said.

""What is the difference between this and Watergate, where operatives broke into the Democrat National Committee?"" he continued. ""Here, in reverse, Democrats broke into the home of the 45th President of the United States."""

Senior correspondent Laura Ingle hosts this multi-part Fox Nation Audio podcast that examines the unsolved murder mystery of the more than ten people, many of them sex workers, found on Long Island.

On a December morning more than a decade ago, a police dog stumbled across a set of female human remains on the south shore of Long Island, New York, along the edge of Ocean Parkway in Gilgo Beach. Law enforcement soon discovered the remains of three more women, stuffed in burlap bags found in thick bramble off a stretch of highway.

Months later, the body of 24-year-old sex worker Shannan Gilbert was also discovered near Oak Beach, not far from the “Gilgo Four,”. Also found were the dismembered remains of other women, a man dressed in female clothing, and a toddler, scattered in various locations throughout Long Island. Investigators announced that a serial killer (or killers) was to blame for the murders. But to this day, no suspects have been publicly named and no arrests have been made in a case that shook a quiet, sleepy beach town to its core, and captivated the nation.

In this Fox Nation series/Fox Audio podcast, produced by Fox News’ Investigative Unit, find out what law enforcement is currently doing to solve the case using new technology. You’ll learn new details from a former escort who believes she spoke with the Long Island serial killer.

There are people like Tim Ryan running for the United States Senate in Ohio. They don’t want him coming to Ohio State. Stacey Abrams says, don’t come to Georgia. I’m actually on the ballot. I don’t want to be on the ballot for you. So I don’t think he’s going to get any invites if he did.”

You’ve heard the expression, “dance like nobody’s watching,” but in Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s case, she’s dancing like her city isn’t experiencing record high rates of homicide, violence and shootings.

She was captured doing the ‘cha cha slide’ at a back-to-school bash on Saturday but meanwhile 53 people were shot, 7 fatally, over the weekend.

How tone-deaf can she possibly be?!

Ya know, there’s nothing wrong with letting your hair down but perhaps Mayor Lightfoot could dedicate a little more of that time and energy into rehabilitating her lawless city!

In 2021, her city’s homicide rate was almost 3x higher than LA and 5x higher than New York City’s! And those cities are also incredibly dangerous, so that’s saying something!

It’s a record-breaking exodus with over 1,000 NYPD officers set to leave the department in 2022, many before their full pensions set in.

Why? Well it’s not hard to figure out. Law enforcement has never been an easy job but when you take that, add the defund and demonize movement, plus felon coddling policies like so-called “bail reform” and mix in Democrat politicians who have turned their backs on officers, this is what you get.

So now what? The already increasingly dangerous, violent and lawless streets get worse.

Policing isn’t a job, it’s a calling but with few incentives left, we can’t be surprised that fewer brave men and women are willing to answer the call.

The GOP primary winner will face off in November with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who faces no primary challenge but who’s being heavily targeted by Republicans as he seeks a second term.

Michels is a multimillionaire owner of a construction company who in early June was endorsed by Trump. Two weeks ago, Pence once again broke with his former boss as he backed Kleefisch.

KLEEFISCH LANDS ANOTHER HIGH PROFILE CONSERVATIVE ENDORSEMENT

""There is no candidate for governor in America that is more capable, more experienced or a more proven conservative than Rebecca Kleefisch,"" Pence said as he teamed up with the former lieutenant governor at a campaign stop in suburban Milwaukee on Wednesday.

And Kleefisch touted that she's ""tested and proven and ready to go,"" and that she's ""the one who has won statewide four times.""

Two days later, as he headlined a rally for Michels in Waukesha, Trump charged that ""Rebecca Kleefisch does not have what it takes to beat Tony Evers… He's going to win if he runs against Rebecca.""

AFTER SNUB FROM TRUMP, KLEEFISCH VOWS SHE'LL WIN WISCONSIN'S GOP GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY

Asked by reporters on the eve of the primary for comments Trump’s derogatory attacks, Kleefisch responded: ""No thoughts that I can share.""

And she seemed to discount Trump’s endorsement of Michels as she emphasized in a Fox News interview on Monday that ""the voters of Wisconsin are going to be the ones who determine the outcome of this race.""

Michels’ campaign attempted to frame Kleefisch as a never Trumper, writing in an email to supporters on primary eve that ""if we don’t get Trump supporters to the polls to vote for Tim Michels on Tuesday, the Never Trumpers will win."" And Michel’s campaign argued that if Kleefisch wins, ""the media will falsely report Wisconsinites have rejected Trump’s endorsement.""

Michels has also spent big bucks to run ads targeting Kleefisch, while the former lieutenant governor has criticized Michels - who owns a home in Connecticut - as a part-time Wisconsin resident.

The candidate Trump backed in last week’s GOP gubernatorial primary in Arizona, former TV news anchor Kari Lake, narrowly edged real estate developer and Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson, who was supported by Pence.

But in May, conservative Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, who was endorsed by Pence, trounced his Trump-backed challenger, former Sen. David Perdue, in the state’s GOP gubernatorial primary.

Besides Pence, two other potential 2024 GOP White House hopefuls, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former South Carolina governor and former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, endorsed Kleefisch this summer. Haley campaigned with the former lieutenant governor and helped her raise roughly $100,000.

In Wisconsin’s high profile Senate race — one of a handful across the country that will likely determine if the Republicans win back the chamber’s majority in November — GOP Sen. Ron Johnson is being heavily targeted by Democrats. Johnson faces a lone long-shot primary challenge on Tuesday from educator David Schroeder

Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes is his party’s all-but-certain Senate nominee on Tuesday, after his leading rivals dropped out of the race in recent weeks and endorsed him. Barnes is also backed by national progressive champions such as Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Barnes is part of a primary field that also includes four lesser-known Democrats.

President Biden narrowly carried Wisconsin as he won the 2020 election, and on Friday at his rally, Trump blasted Republican state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos for not embracing his unproven claims that his 2020 loss to Biden was due to massive voter fraud.

While Vos — who’s the state’s longest serving Assembly speaker — launched a controversial investigation into the 2020 election in Wisconsin and took a lead in passing a series of bills that tightened voting access in the state, he’s resisted Trump’s repeated calls to try and decertify the 2020 election results.

Minnesota

Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota faces a long shot primary challenge as he seeks a second term. Three Republicans are running in their party’s primary, including doctor and former state Sen. Scott Jenson, who landed the state GOP’s endorsement.

There's a special election on Tuesday in the state's primarily rural 1st Congressional District, along the state's southern border with Iowa, to fill the seat left vacant after GOP Rep. Jim Hagedorn died of cancer in February. The winner will serve the remainder of Hagedorn's term through the end of the year.

But complicating matters is that this isn't the only election in the district. There's also the reguarly scheduled primary

In the state’s Minneapolis-centric 5th Congressional District, progressive first-term Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, a member of the ""Squad,"" is facing four primary challengers. One of them — former Minneapolis City Councilman Don Samuels — is endorsed by a handful of former Minnesota mayors and has spotlighted his law enforcement support while criticizing Omar for pushing to dismantle the city’s police department.

In Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District, in the Twin Cities southern suburbs, all eyes are on November’s general election, when Democratic incumbent Rep. Angie Craig and 2020 GOP nominee Tyler Kistner will face off in a rematch.

Connecticut

Three Republicans are running in Tuesday’s Senate GOP primary in Connecticut, with the winner facing off in November against Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal. They are former state House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, businesswoman Leora Levy and businessman Peter Lumai.

It’s been 40 years since a Republican won a Senate election in the blue state of Connecticut.

Vermont

The Senate seat held for nearly a half century by retiring Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy is up for grabs.

Longtime Rep. Peter Welch is considered the overwhelming front-runner over two other rivals in the Democratic primary. Former U.S. attorney Christine Nolan, Army veteran Gerald Malloy and investment banker Myers Mermel are seeking the Republican nomination.

With Welch running for the Senate, there are competitive primaries in both parties for his open House seat.

Republican Gov. Phil Scott faces two primary challengers on Tuesday. Activist Brenda Seigel is unopposed for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.

New York Times opinion columnist Paul Krugman wrote that Democrats took a step toward saving the world by passing the Inflation Reduction Act in the Senate and setting the stage for climate change provisions as well as health reforms in the process.

""This is a very big deal. The act isn’t, by itself, enough to avert climate disaster. But it’s a huge step in the right direction, and sets the stage for more action in the years ahead,"" Krugman wrote, in a piece headlined, ""Did Democrats Just Save Civilization?""

Multiple White House staffers and Democrats have taken to social media attempting to rebrand President Biden as ""dark Brandon"" amid a series of legislative victories.

""Dark Brandon is crushing it,"" Andrew Bates, the White House deputy press secretary, tweeted Sunday evening along with an image of Biden with laser eyes.

""Your malarkey has been going on for long enough, kiddo,"" read the image's caption.

Bates then tweeted another meme with the captions ""the malarkey will end"" and ""the dark Brandon rises"" in response to a tweet criticizing his initial post. The image appeared to depict Biden as Batman.

REPUBLICANS SAY DEMOCRATS WILL ‘PAY THE PRICE’ IN MIDTERMS FOR PASSING MASSIVE SPENDING BILL

But conservatives pointed out that the second image tweeted by Bates included eagle imagery resembling the logo used by the Nazi Party in the 1930s.

""Personally, I'm not surprised that you're tweeting out Nazi eagle imagery of your boss who reminisces about his segregationist 'mentor,'"" Abigail Marone, a spokesperson for Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., tweeted.

""'Dark Brandon' started as Chinese propaganda and then the White House co-opted it using Nazi Eagle imagery..."" Alec Sears, a digital staffer at the Republican National Committee, tweeted. ""They're not sending their best.""

""In 2020, the Trump campaign faced a week of stories and fact checks about a t-shirt with an eagle on it,"" Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for former President Trump's 2020 campaign, tweeted. ""Let’s see if a tweet from an official Biden White House account gets the same treatment.""

However, the apparent creator of the image said Monday that the image was never intended to be the ""Reichsadler"" seen in Nazi imagery, in an interview with The Washington Post. He said it was instead meant to represent a bald eagle.

The White House suggested the Nazi imagery allegation originated from Jack Posobiec, a conservative commentator linked to conspiracy theories.

""Who could have guessed that some Pizzagate/QAnon guy lies?"" Bates told Fox News Digital in an email. ""Have y’all seen this, though?""

Bates then pointed to a tweet Monday containing allegations from Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that former President Trump insisted U.S. generals be more like ""German generals in World War II.""

The ""Dark Brandon"" moniker appears to have started on Twitter in March among anonymous Biden supporters seeking to create an ""edgy"" version of the president, according to an online meme database. The meme also seeks to co-opt the ""let's go Brandon"" meme that originated among conservatives online and has become popular for those that oppose the Biden administration's agenda.

In addition, Rob Flaherty, the White House director of digital strategy, tweeted an image of Biden with laser eyes. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., also appeared to parrot the ""dark Brandon"" meme, posting an animation of Biden without pupils without a caption Sunday.

Megan Apper, who left the White House earlier this year to join the State Department, joined in on the ""Dark Brandon"" tweets, tweeting, ""Dark Brandon said ‘here’s the deal’ and then there was a deal.""

The apparent rebranding of Biden comes after several victories Democrats said showed the president has been successful overcoming gridlock on Capitol Hill.

In June, Biden signed a gun control bill that incentivizes states to approve red flag laws and introduce increased background checks, and last week, Biden signed the $280 billion Chips and Science Act, which boosts funding for the domestic semiconductor supply chain.

And, on Sunday, the Senate approved the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping budget reconciliation package that would introduce new green energy incentives and attempt to lower pharmaceutical prices.

""For decades, the gun lobby and the oil companies and the drug industry controlled Washington. And ordinary people suffered,"" Murphy tweeted. ""And [sic] then, in one summer, all that changed. The first gun safety bill in 30 years. Historic climate change legislation. Caps on drug costs. Just wow.""

However, conservatives were quick to criticize Democrats claiming victory and rebranding Biden as ""dark Brandon.""

Nicole Linton, 37, of Houston, was charged on Monday with six counts of murder and five counts of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence.

A massive search effort was underway Tuesday morning for the missing California 16-year-old Kiely Rodni, who vanished after telling family she was going to head home from a high school graduation sendoff early Saturday.

The Placer County Sheriff’s Office has said they were investigating a possible abduction because the girl’s SUV was also unaccounted for. Rodni graduated from high school two years early, and it is unlike her to run away or fail to come home, according to her mother, Lindsey Rodni-Nieman

A spokesperson told Fox News Digital Tuesday that investigators were still ""exploring all possibilities"" and confirmed that teens were using alcohol and drugs at the party.

Rodni had enough drinks to become drunk, according to her friend and another recent graduate, Sami Smith, who added that she did not believe the teen would have driven under the circumstances.

""At the point when I left, I thought she was going to stay there,"" said Smith, who departed the campground just a few minutes before Rodni was last seen. ""Everybody was camping. It was late enough that she should have stayed. She’s not the type to go and drunk drive or anything.""

Smith said she spent most of the night with Rodni.

""For the amount of drinks we both had together, she’s not that dumb,"" she added. ""I remember we were partying together. She was having fun. She seemed really happy -- she was like normal, just on an adrenaline rush. Saying ‘Hi’ to everybody.

But Rodni-Nieman, says her daughter texted her around 12:15 a.m. Saturday and said she was heading home. The family lives about 10 miles away from the campground at a lodge south of town.

Smith, 18, said that there were plenty of attendees whom she had not previously met, but none who seemed suspicious, gave unwanted attention or followed the pair around.

She said she didn’t notice anyone much older and that the party consisted mainly of teens, recent graduates and some college students from the surrounding areas. Some came from as far away as San Francisco, she said, but that was not unusual because the area is a summer vacation town.

""We met a few strangers together,"" she said. ""We both tended to trust people, I say tended to because now I don’t think I will continue to trust people. But she’ll give anyone the benefit of the doubt.""

Search crews and police from multiple counties scoured through the area beginning early Tuesday morning.

They started by searching Lake Prosser by boat as the land-based search party gathered on the shoreline.

Several aircraft, including helicopters and airplanes flying in formation above, all-terrain vehicles ranging including four-wheelers, trikes and dirt bikes. There were canines present and at least 100 members of law enforcement visible, including members of the FBI, who initially focused their attention on Campsite 4.

Crews pulled the boats from the water around noon and FBI agents were seen knocking on doors in the area. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""Right now, we are currently searching many areas,"" said Angela Musallam, the Placer County Sheriff’s public information officer.

The party, which stretched from Friday night into Saturday morning at the Prosser Family Campground in the Tahoe National Forest, involved dozens or hundreds of kids from a handful of nearby communities in the rural area, including Truckee, North Lake.

Around 12:15 a.m., she texted her parents that she was heading home. However, according to her mother, no one has come forward to say they saw her leave; no one was with her at the time; and nobody could remember when she left or seeing her car drive away.

Her phone, which last pinged at the party, has been turned off. Authorities say her vehicle, a silver 2013 Honda CRV with the California license plate 8YUR127, is also unaccounted for.

Authorities are urging teens who were at the party to come forward, and the community announced a ""Teen to Teen"" information gathering event from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. PT at the Tahoe City Save Mart in an effort to get attendees talking.

""We have had a lack of reach out from many Tahoe kids who were at the party or may know any information,"" the announcement reads. ""We are only looking for information such as who was at the party that you may have seen ad the times you came and left.""

Rodni’s mother is asking anyone who attended the party and their parents to look through their photos, social media posts and videos for any signs of Rodni. Home and business owners in the surrounding area are also asked to check their surveillance cameras for signs of the girl on Aug. 5 and 6.

Former Kamala Harris aide Symone Sanders, now an MSNBC weekend host, pleaded with people to stop calling the FBI search of former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence a ""raid"" on Tuesday.

""Please folks stop calling it a ‘raid,’"" she tweeted, later responding to critics in amusement.

Those words may have been directed at her fellow MSNBC hosts and producers, who used the ""raid"" language on the air often Monday evening.

""The FBI raided Donald Trump’s Florida home today on the 48th anniversary, today is the 48th anniversary of the day that Republican president Richard Nixon announced that he was resigning the presidency,"" anchor Lawrence O'Donnell said Monday.

Even former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo raised eyebrows on Twitter when he called on the Justice Department to justify the ""raid"" or else jeopardize other investigations like the one into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

MSNBC seemed to change tacks on Tuesday, with more hosts and reporters quoting Trump's ""raid"" language but mostly describing it as a search instead.

""Already the former president has called it a raid. And the veteran FBI officials telling us it’s more of a simple search, which is something they do routinely,"" reporter Kerry Sanders said on Tuesday.

Trump's statement about the FBI raid on Monday employed dramatic language as he declared his home was ""under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents."" The Secret Service allowed the FBI in to conduct its search, which Trump added was an ""unannounced raid.""

Sanders took heat from some conservatives and Republicans for her admonition.

""What is a woman? What is a recession? What is a raid?"" Ted Cruz communications director Steve Guest asked mockingly.

TWITTER SQUIRMS AS BIDEN LOOKS LOST, COUGHS THROUGH SPEECHES, SHAKES HANDS AFTERWARDS: ‘NOT FIT TO SERVE’

Sanders isn't the only MSNBC personality to take exception to the term. As the news broke Monday, anchor Alicia Menendez asked former FBI agent Frank Figliuzzi how the FBI was able to ""pull off this raid."" Figliuzzi, a national security contributor at MSNBC, objected to her terminology during his answer.

""Agents don’t like the word ‘raid,’ they don’t like it. It sounds like it’s some sort of extrajudicial, non-legal thing. It’s an execution of a search warrant. It’s a court-authorized search warrant,"" he said.

Many print outlets used the term ""raid"" independently of Trump, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Associated Press, Reuters, CNBC, Politico and others.

Sources told Fox News on Tuesday that investigators from the Justice Department visited Mar-a-Lago in June for a meeting about turning over records as part of an investigation into documents former President Trump allegedly took with him from the White House to his private residence when he left office in January 2021.

Trump's attorneys were present at that meeting and the sources say the former president himself stopped in to say hello for a few minutes.

The meeting came months after the National Archives — with assistance from the Justice Department — was able to get 15 boxes of documents sent back to Washington, D.C., after expressing concern they were in Florida.

The June meeting was about additional documents that were being sought. But following it, the Justice Department and FBI felt they weren't getting the same cooperation they had been receiving earlier in the probe, according to a source with knowledge of negotiations between Trump's team and the federal entities.

The perceived lack of cooperation is why a search warrant was requested and ultimately executed on Monday, Aug. 8, at Trump's Palm Beach property.

Sanders resigned as a top aide to Harris last year and joined MSNBC, where she hosts the weekend program ""Symone."" She's been followed in that regard by former White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who stepped down in May and will soon have her own Peacock streaming show.

A study posted in the National Library of Medicine documented the ""significant"" increase in body weight in children during coronavirus lockdowns and concluded that young people with pre-existing obesity, of Hispanic and African-American ethnicity and living in poverty suffered the most.

The study, published in July by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, combed through a biomedical literature database to assess ""the extent and risk factors of lockdown-induced weight increase"" as well as ""the impact of obesity on the risk of hospital admission in children and adolescents.""

The study found that a ""significant weight increase was reported in the majority of subjects"" regardless of age and gender, particularly in children who were already struggling with weight issues.

""The highest weight/BMI increase was observed in children with pre-existing overweight/obesity, of Hispanic and African American ethnicity, and in those living unfavorable socioeconomic conditions, therefore, most vulnerable to unhealthy lifestyle, food insecurity, family and social stress (i.e., lower parental psychological and educational support, and higher financial concerns/limitations), and with difficult access to academic resources and healthcare services,"" the study states.

The study concluded that ""data analysis clearly demonstrated the detrimental impact of COVID-19 lockdown on children and adolescents’ body weight and BMI, children with pre-existing overweight/obesity being more at risk of gaining weight.""

The weight gain in children came as a result of homeschooling, sitting in front of screens like tablets and televisions, less physical activity, junk food and excessive eating, the study says.

""The COVID-19 pandemic had a huge impact on the health and well-being of children and adolescents.

The analysis, which is a conservative estimate based upon recent audit rates and tax filing data, shows that individuals with an annual income of $75,000 or less would be subject to 710,863 additional Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits while those making more than $1 million would receive 52,295 more audits under the bill.

To boost tax enforcement, the Inflation Reduction Act would appropriate more than $79 billion in additional funds to the IRS over the next decade, nearly doubling the agency's current budget. The IRS is expected to hire tens of thousands more agents to enhance enforcement efforts that are projected to increase revenue by $124 billion.

In response to criticism about the expected uptick in tax audits under the bill, IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said Thursday that ""audit rates"" will not increase relative to recent years.

The legislation doesn't explicitly guarantee that Americans making under $400,000 won't see tax increases under the IRS provision. The bill states that it is not ""intended"" to increase rates for taxpayers who aren't in the top 1% of earners.

""There is language in this bill that provides some guidelines, but it's not at all a guarantee,"" William McBride, the vice president of federal tax and economic policy at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, told FOX Business in an interview. ""It indicates that the intent of the increased spending is not to target those earning less than $400,000. But intent is a somewhat squishy word.""

""The fact of the matter is most returns report income under $100,000,"" he continued. ""That's where the money is, so to speak.""

The FBI raid on former President Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago has unleashed a familiar euphoria among critics who have longed for the scene of agents descending upon the president's residence in a criminal operation.

One MSNBC pundit declared on Monday night, after the news of the raid broke, that day of the ""orange jumpsuit"" may finally be at hand while another simply exclaimed ""hallelujah."" It was a tad premature since we do not even know if classified material was found and, if so, whether there is a criminal case to be made from such a discovery.

I previously testified in Congress on the earlier seizure of the boxes at Mar-a-Lago under the Presidential Records Act and how criminal prosecutions have been rare under the law. Nevertheless, criminal charges are possible, including under Section 2071 which states that anyone who ""willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates or destroys … any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited … in any public office."" That crime, however, requires a showing of not just negligence but ""an act is ... done voluntarily and intentionally and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids.""

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA 'UNDER SIEGE' BY FBI AGENTS

Notably, even the most serious cases of mishandling classified records have not resulted in major charges. One example is that of former Clinton National Security Adviser Sandy Berger who was found to have secretly stuffed classified material into his pants and socks to remove them from a secure facility. He then hid them in a spot to be retrieved later. It was a flagrant and premeditated violation of federal law and put national security secrets at risk.

Yet, Berger was allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and did not have to serve any jail time. Indeed, his security clearance was suspended for only three years.

However, critics were not particularly interested in whether Trump might have some suspended misdemeanor sentence. Rather, even before learning if any evidence of criminal conduct was found, critics turned to the ability to use the charge to disqualify Trump from future office.

Section 2071 has excited the imagination of such critics because of a line that states that a convicted party can ""be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.""

That enticing possibility has already been highlighted by Marc Elias, Hillary Clinton's campaign lawyer who was a critical player in pushing the false Russian collusion claims in the Steele dossier. In addition to accusations that he may have lied about the funding of the Steele dossier, Elias has been sanctioned in court for his conduct representing Democratic causes.

RAID ON TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO HOME BY BIDEN'S POLITICIZED FBI MEANS US NOW A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY

Yet, Elias was not alone citing the possible use of a Section 2071 charge to block Trump's expected presidential run in 2024. Former federal prosecutor Harry Litman even suggested that this could be the actual plan of the Justice Department to end Trump's political career: ""So this could be the whole enchilada in terms of DOJ resolution.""

Consider that culinary-legal analysis for a second. The claim is that the Justice Department may be actively seeking to use a charge to block Trump as the real motivation for this raid and possible charge. There is not a hint of concern over the FBI being used to achieve such a political purpose. That is putting aside the fact that, unless there is evidence of a ""willful and unlawful"" effort to conceal or retain such material, the FBI could end up an enchilada short of a combination plate for prosecution.

There is also a significant constitutional hurdle facing this latest means of barring Trump from office. This is not the first time that this disqualification argument has been made and scholars have previously raised constitutional objections to it.

The problem is that the law would add a qualification or condition that is not stated in the Constitution. There are constitutional ways to impeach a president or to bar a former president from future office. The mishandling of official records is not one of them.

In analogous cases like Powell v. McCormack and U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, the Supreme Court rejected the authority of states to impose new qualifications for congressional seats under Article I. The same is presumably true under Article II when it comes to the chief executive.

There is ample reason to doubt that the presidency would be deemed barred by statute in this fashion. What would not be in doubt is how such a novel claim of disqualification would be received by millions of citizens already skeptical of the motivations of both the Biden administration and specifically the FBI.

The basis and even the motivation of this raid will become clear in time, including whether there is evidence of willful and unlawful conduct by the former president. However, whatever this raid produces, this ""enchilada"" will likely be hard for most judges to swallow as a way to keeping Trump off the ballot in 2024.

Republican Arkansas gubernatorial candidate Sarah Huckabee Sanders took aim at the Arkansas Democratic-Gazette (ADG) over what she deemed was a ""double standard"" between how the paper treats her versus her Democratic opponent.

""When I released my plan, I invited Sanders to participate in this important statewide conversation. Unfortunately, she's still an unexcused absence on education at this time,"" Jones wrote Thursday.

Marc Elias, a top lawyer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, said Monday that former President Trump could be disqualified from making another run at the White House in 2024 following the FBI raid of his Florida residence.

FBI agents executed a search warrant of Trump's Mar-a-Lago property on Monday reportedly seeking classified documents he allegedly took from the White House when he left office in 2021. The search warrant was conducted in connection with the National Archives, according to a senior government official.

This led Elias to cite U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2071 to highlight that Trump could be barred from seeking public office again, as the former president continues to drop hints that he will soon announce plans to seek a second term as commander-in-chief.

""The media is missing the really, really big reason why the raid today is a potential blockbuster in American politics,"" Elias wrote in a tweet.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA ‘UNDER SEIGE’ BY FBI AGENTS

Elias pointed to the passage of U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2071 that states, ""Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.""

However, legal challenges could make efforts to prevent Trump from running again under this code difficult, Elias noted in a follow-up tweet.

""Yes, I recognize the legal challenge that application of this law to a president would garner (since qualifications are set in Constitution). But the idea that a candidate would have to litigate this is during a campaign is in my view a ‘blockbuster in American politics,’"" he wrote.

The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires presidential administrations to preserve certain documents.

According to the National Archives, the presidential records in 15 boxes taken from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year include documents classified over national security concerns.

The agency has also called on the Department of Justice to probe whether the former president violated federal law in his handling of records.

""Because [the National Archives and Records Administration] identified classified information in the boxes, NARA staff has been in communication with the Department of Justice,"" then-U.S. archivist David Ferriero wrote in a letter to Congress.

Trump released a statement Monday announcing the FBI's raid and he slammed the federal government for its search of his property.

""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections,"" he continued, adding that ""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries.""

Kidd's comments come after researchers at the university anonymously surveyed close to 3,000 students in grades 7-12 in Appalachian region public schools, finding that more than 7% of respondents identified with a gender other than their sex at birth.

The findings follow a 2017 UCLA study that found West Virginia had the highest per capita rate of transgender youth in the country, estimating that just over 1% of the state's youth identified with a gender other than their sex at birth. The WVU findings suggest that the 2017 study may have severely underestimated that number, which researchers say may be due to the lack of ability to reach youth in rural areas.

""Despite the high prevalence of gender-diverse identities found in our Pittsburgh study, information about rural areas was still unknown,"" Kidd said. ""We suspect that many of the young people in rural Appalachia who shared their gender-diverse identities with us in this study may benefit from additional support, especially if they do not feel seen and supported at home and in their community.""

Kidd pointed out that the numbers could raise issues for public health officials, noting that gender-diverse youth are at increased risk of mental health disorders, suicide, and depression.

""Adolescent mental health is at a crisis point, according to the Centers for Disease Control,"" Kidd said. ""We have an access concern because so many young people need mental health services nationwide and we just don’t have enough mental health professionals to meet that need.

The research also comes as the state has been battling a lawsuit filed in 2020 against the state's ban on using Medicaid for transgender surgical procedures.

According to a ruling last week by District Court Judge Robert C. Chambers, the state's exclusion of gender transition surgeries for the treatment of gender dysphoria ""invidiously discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status.""

West Virginia is one of nine states with Medicaid rules that exclude covering transgender medical interventions, though officials in Ohio say their state's ban is not enforced and an Arkansas ban only applies to minors. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration is currently considering a similar exclusion on covering transgender medical interventions such as puberty blockers, hormones, gender transition surgeries or ""any other procedures that alter primary or secondary sexual characteristics,"" according to reporting from The Hill.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which passed along party lines with Democrats employing the budget reconciliation process, would raise an estimated $739 billion over the next decade, with the revenues going toward initiatives designed to combat climate change and curb pharmaceutical prices, as well as efforts to reduce the nation's $30 trillion debt.

It includes about $433 billion in new spending, while roughly $300 billion of the new revenue raised would go toward paying down the nation's deficit.

Some of the main revenue raisers stem from new levies on wealthy businesses, including a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases that is poised to take effect in 2023. Democrats, who estimated this new levy will raise about $74 billion over the next decade, are hoping to slow companies' tendency to buy back their own stock from investors with the tax.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT: WHAT TAX HIKES ARE IN THE BILL?

Companies have been allowed to buy their own shares since 1982, and the practice has since become commonplace on Wall Street. In 2019, stock buybacks hit a record $1 trillion, according to the SEC. Buybacks already hit a record $281 billion in the first three months of 2022, according to S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt. Although they were down 17.4% in the second quarter.

""I hate stock buybacks,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""I think they are one of the most self-serving things that corporate America does.""

The bill also imposes a 15% minimum tax on corporations based on profits they publicly report on their financial statements to shareholders. The minimum book tax would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income. Democrats said the levy would affect around 200 of the country's largest corporations with profits exceeding $1 billion and that pay less than the current 21% rate for businesses.

Experts expect the two taxes to drag on 2023 earnings, with Goldman Sachs forecasting a 1.5% decline per share of S&P 500 companies. The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.

UBS strategists led by Solita Marcelli, meanwhile, projected the new taxes would have a ""very minimal 1% drag on S&P 500 earnings per share, although some companies will be more affected than others.""

A West Virginia man was killed while on vacation with his family after he offered to give a stranger a ride home, his family says.

Josh Wilson, 40, was driving back to his hotel with his wife and son when he stopped at a gas station in Myrtle Beach, SC. While filling up, a man approached and asked for a ride. Josh agreed to pick him up after he'd dropped off his family at the hotel.

President Biden signed documents backing the entry of Sweden and Finland into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Tuesday.

""Putin thought he could break us apart… weaken our resolve,"" Biden said during a news conference announcing U.S. ratification of expanding NATO to include Finland and Sweden. ""Instead, he’s getting exactly what he did not want. He wanted the Findalization [Finland-ization] of NATO, but he’s getting the NATO-ization of Finland.""

Before signing the documents, Biden touted the expansion as a ""watershed moment"" that would enhance the security of ""not only Europe and the United States, but of the world.""

Biden urged the rest of the NATO allies to quickly ratify the expansion as well, noting the shared values Finland and Sweden have with the 30-member alliance.

""Sweden and Finland have strong democratic institutions, strong militaries, and strong and transparent economies that will meet every NATO requirement,"" the president said.

Finland and Sweden's membership will be the first significant expansion of the alliance since the Soviet Union's collapse in the 1990s. Their acceptance into the bloc marks a rebuke to Russia amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The Senate approved the move in a rare showing of bipartisan support, voting 95-1 last week in favor of the expansion. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was the only senator to vote against the measure, arguing that it would take focus away from China, which he considers America's primary geopolitical foe.

NATO MAKES THE RIGHT CALL ON SWEDEN, FINLAND IN A BIG, BOLD MOVE

""We can do more in Europe... devote more resources, more firepower ... or do what we need to do to deter Asia and China. We cannot do both,"" Hawley said, according to the Associated Press.

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell welcomed the news, arguing that the move would boost national security.

""Their accession will make NATO stronger and America more secure. If any senator is looking for a defensible excuse to vote no, I wish them good luck,"" McConnell said.

Biden immediately signalled his support for the measure after the Senate vote.

""I look forward to signing the accession protocols and welcoming Sweden and Finland, two strong democracies with highly capable militaries, into the greatest defensive alliance in history,"" Biden said in a statement last week after the Senate overwhelmingly approved their membership.

Finland and Sweden's application to join NATO came in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, with membership in the alliance being strongly opposed by the Kremlin.

NATO's 30 current member-states signed the accession protocol for the two countries last month, clearing the way for the members to formally ratify their membership.

All 30 current NATO members must ratify the decision to allow Finland and Sweden's membership before they can be protected by Article Five of the NATO Charter, which states an attack on one NATO country is an attack on all members.

CNN legal analyst Paul Callan called the Justice Department's raid on former President Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago home a ""daring and dangerous move"" that was ""not warranted"" if it was only about Trump holding onto classified documents after his time in office.

During CNN’s ""At This Hour with Kate Bolduan"" on Wednesday, the host spoke to legal analyst Paul Callan, who expressed hope that the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have something more serious on Trump than currents reports indicate, otherwise their raid on Trump’s massive West Palm Beach residence went too far.

Bolduan prompted Callan by bringing up speculation that the federal government conducted the raid to seize classified documents retained by the former president that he was not authorized to have after leaving the White House.

As Clinton 2016 campaign lawyer Marc Elias mused on Twitter Tuesday evening, Trump may have violated the Presidential Records Act of 1978, prompting the raid, and an ensuing investigation which could bar him from running for political office in the future.

Bolduan asked, ""If this becomes a Presidential Records Act violation, not more, do you think it’s enough to warrant all this?"" Callan responded that it’s not.

""No, it’s not enough to warrant all this,"" the legal analyst declared, adding, ""And this is a daring and dangerous move by the Department of Justice, to serve a warrant on a former president and raid his personal residence.""

Callan inferred that for the government to go this far, there must be ""something more"" than Trump merely holding onto classified documents after his term. ""So, I have to think that the Department of Justice must have something more than an argument about what kind of records have to be saved for a presidential library or the Library of Congress at some future date.""

""There’s more to this than meets the eye,"" Callan continued, adding, ""And I have to think that there’s something a lot more serious that they think is being withheld from the presidential collection.""

Former President Trump, who was in New York City during the time of the raid, condemned the action in a statement on Monday evening, calling it ""prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024.""

On Monday evening, the Florida governor tweeted, ""The raid of MAL [Mar-a-Lago] is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves. Now the Regime is getting another 87k IRS agents to wield against its adversaries? Banana Republic.""

""Yes it would,"" Schumer agreed. After asking Schumer about the sprawling Inflation Reduction Act and working with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Maddow brought up the Mar-a-Lago raid again but noted that she understood he didn't want to talk about the substance of it.

BNPL INCLUSION IN CREDIT REPORTS CAUSES GROWING CONSUMER CONCERNS, SURVEY CLAIMS

Americans coping with rising prices

Inflation is currently surging and increased in June to a new 40-year high, marking the fifth time it's broken that record this year. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 9.1% annually in June, hitting its highest point since November 1981, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

Because of this, many consumers are needing to dip into their savings or fund their purchases with credit, according to data from Morning Consult Economic Intelligence . Intentions to buy big-ticket items such as electronics, trips and vacations, home appliances and furniture have all decreased over the past year.

But despite these setbacks, consumer balance sheets are historically strong, according to Morning Consult. Net wealth as a share of disposable income is currently near a record high as household debt as a share of total assets is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, according to data from the Federal Reserve.

Because of this, some consumers, especially from higher-income households, are actually increasing their spending and expected spending, according to the Morning Consult report. Households with an annual income of at least $50,000 reported a 25% increase in monthly spending from May 2021 to May 2022.

""To put it simply: People still have the means to buy things, but they are expecting items to cost more,"" the report stated. ""And Morning Consult data indicates that they’re using BNPL to pay for some of them. The consistency with which U.S. consumers have used BNPL to fund their purchases throughout 2022 indicates that the payment form may be helping to keep their price sensitivity and substitutions at bay, and should be viewed as an indicator of the staying power of BNPL.""

Adults with annual income between $50,000 and $99,999 as well as those with an annual income of $100,000 or more are even more likely to have used BNPL for a purchase over the past month at 21% and 20%, respectively.

And consumers expect to continue using BNPL.

""As more retailers partner with BNPL providers and more payment providers create their own BNPL offerings, adoption and strong usage will likely continue,"" the report stated.

Across the country, librarians in schools and public libraries are stocking the shelves with material that is so pornographic that when parents have tried to read aloud and show the material at school board meetings, their microphones were cut off.

For progressives, the victim of the situation isn’t the children exposed to inappropriate content; the hero of the story isn’t the parents fighting for their kids’ innocence. No, the hero and victim of the coverage of these incidents are the librarians buying the sexually explicit content and recommending it to children.

Librarians are putting themselves on the front lines of a culture war, often shooting the first shots, and then bemoaning that they’ve found themselves under fire. But here’s the thing: Libraries have turned themselves into battlegrounds for these arguments, and librarians, one of the most radically progressive professions, have made them that way.

If you’re hosting drag queen story hour and stocking literal pornography on the shelves, you’ve surrendered the right to just ask for a quiet and respectful conversation about how you’re doing your job.

FLORIDA SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER DEMANDS ‘DISCIPLINARY ACTION’ OVER PORNOGRAPHIC BOOKS IN SCHOOLS: ‘I’M DISGUSTED'

How libraries are functioning is an assault on our children, paid for by our tax dollars. It’s long past time for parents to fight back, even if they’re called book banners for doing so. Librarians turned themselves into political warriors and are trying to make our kids into their foot soldiers. They don’t get to do so without a fight.

Progressives have received their talking points on the matter. Efforts on the part of parents to make sure that inappropriate and pornographic materials aren’t available to their children is called ""book banning."" In April, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., chairman of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, held a hearing to examine what he called ""the ongoing efforts across the country to ban books from schools and public libraries.""

A single mother of a middle schooler in Raskin’s district, Marilyn (who asked to be anonymous for professional reasons), shared with me her own story. She told me,

""My daughter started asking to go to the school early so she could spend some time in the library and came home with 'George' by Alex Gino. I had not heard of this book, and have yet to meet the school librarian. I asked my daughter if she picked out the book and she told me that the librarian gave it to her and said she thought she would like it. I still have no idea why.

""The school librarian also apparently said the same things about 'Rick' by Alex Gino. 'The Art of Being Normal' by Lisa Williamson also came home from the school library. These three books are the only books that came home from the school library in Montgomery County in 2021-2022.""

Gino’s book ""George,"" which has since been renamed ""Melissa,"" has been at the top of the American Library Association’s list of Top 10 Most Challenged Books for several years. The ALA, with its list, posit the book challenges are akin to censorship. Here’s a sample from ""George,"" just to get an idea of what many parents objected to:

""George stopped. It was such a short little question, but she couldn’t make her mouth form the sounds.

""Mom, what if I’m a girl?

""George had seen an interview on television a few months ago with a beautiful woman named Tina. She had golden-brown skin, thick hair with blond highlights, and long, sparkling fingernails. The interviewer said that Tina had been born a boy, then asked her whether she’d had the surgery. The woman replied that she was a transgender woman and that what she had between her legs was nobody’s business but hers and her boyfriends.

""So George knew it could be done. A boy could become a girl. She had since read on the Internet you could take girl hormones that would change your body, and you could get a bunch of different surgeries if you wanted them and had the money. This was called transitioning. You could even start before you were 18 with pills called adrogen blockers that stopped the boy hormones already inside you from turning your body into a man’s. But for that, you needed your parents’ permission.""

In 2021, Gino’s ""George / Melissa"" was finally getting knocked out of the top spot by a new book, ""Gender Queer,"" by Maia Kobabe. In its coverage of the ""book banning"" wars in the its Sunday newsletter, the New York Times interviewed Alexandra Alter, a Times reporter covering the publishing industry on the subject, and in its graphics illustrating the newsletter item, ""Gender Queer"" was one of the books highlighted.

Alter was asked, ""How are librarians responding?"" And Alexandra laid it on, thick with her reply, ""It’s heartbreaking for them. Librarians say they got into this field because of a love of reading and talking to people about books. Some have left their jobs; some have been fired for refusing to remove books. Others quit after being subject to a barrage of insults on social media.""

When will U.S. foreign policy get better instead of worse?","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

President Joe Biden's foreign policy is a toxic mix of ideas from both extremes of the political spectrum.

On the one hand, Biden and company have embraced the Obama era policy of maximum restraint. The idea is that the less the U.S. engages in foreign affairs, the fewer problems it will have to deal with.

The problem with maximum restraint is that it can let a manageable foreign problem fester and grow into a tremendous problem. It’s like when a homeowner keeps putting off fixing a leaky roof; one day the ceiling will collapse.

WHITE HOUSE SUMMONS CHINESE AMBASSADOR AMID MILITARY EXERCISES, DIPLOMATIC RETALIATION FOR PELOSI TAIWAN VISIT

Maximum restraint can also lead to precipitous withdrawal from foreign engagements. This too can be disastrous. For example, Obama precipitously withdrew from Iraq, and ISIS promptly filled the vacuum. Biden did the same in Afghanistan, and we now know that Al Qaeda has already reestablished a foothold there.

The reality is: Whenever America walks away, our adversaries happily fill in. Just look at what happened at our southern border. As soon as Biden reversed all of Trump’s border security measures, the cartels started lining up people to come across.

On the other hand, Biden is often over-eager to engage on the world stage, turning American interests over to globalist management. The idea is that we can make the world safer, more equitable and more just if we follow the wisdom of global elites and govern according to international agreements on everything from climate policy and tax policy to labor policy and the treatment of women.

The problem with this is that it can sacrifice our national interests — and our sovereignty — abiding by international compacts that our enemies ignore, and our friends find preposterous. For example, the Chinese have zero intent of following the U.S. into the abyss of ""net zero"" green energy policy. To keep their economy growing, they are building coal plants right and left.

Yet, Biden persists in thinking that he and other leaders of developed nations can establish global ""norms"" by pledging to follow the dictates of Davos. This is like the little kid sitting in a grocery cart who thinks he is steering down the aisle.

By following these impulses to 1) do nothing and 2) tell everyone else what to do, Biden believes he is reducing risk and making a better world. In reality, what he has is a schizophrenic foreign policy that has increased global risk and left our friends and allies dazed and confused.

The most recent victim of this approach was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Her trip to Taiwan was important. And the stakes were high. China is America’s No. 1 threat, and Taiwan is the most serious issue that divides us. One would think every step the president would take would be serious, deliberate and proactive, because that is how serious people deal with serious risks. Not Joe.

His first instinct was to try to make the problem go away. So, he asked Pelosi to cancel the visit. This would have been a big slap in the face to Taiwan and a huge loss of face for the U.S.

When Pelosi refused, Biden then called Chinese President Xi Jinping and, after meekly reassuring him that the U.S. still clings to the ""One China Policy."" asked him to back down from his regime’s saber-rattling rhetoric opposing the trip. Again, no effect.

Indeed, throughout the crisis, Biden came across — to China, to Taiwan, to Pelosi and the rest of the world — as little more than a do-nothing Bystander-in-Chief. (Though, in fairness, he did tweet afterward.)

Once Pelosi left, China ramped-up its ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy ringing Taiwan with live fire drills. The administration response was mostly finger-waving at the Chinese, tut-tutting that they were not following the international norms as approved by our globalist overlords in Davos. Beijing must still be laughing.

But this is no laughing matter. Just ask Ukraine. When Putin threatened to invade, Biden tried the mix of do nothing, threatening with a handful of sanctions, and finger-waving about international norms. Rather than being deterred, Russia started a war that has harmed our economy and lowered our national security.

When will U.S. foreign policy get better instead of worse? The answer is: When the administration starts dealing with risks, rather than ignoring them."

Unknown to most Americans, the Chinese Communist Party has been buying our farms, land and even our homes for decades. Why? So they can take our food, technology and other resources for themselves.

What’s worse – it’s perfectly legal. That’s why I’ve introduced a bill to ban the Chinese Communists – and those acting on their behalf – from buying even another handful of American soil.

In recent years, China has exponentially increased its U.S. land holdings, especially of farmland. Between 2010 and 2020, China increased its agricultural land holding by nearly 2,500%, to encompass over 350,000 acres of American soil. Communists have not only purchased the fields and pastures of rural America, they have also taken control of food processing companies like the Virginia-based pork giant, Smithfield.

Chinese communists are gobbling up American agriculture in part because China can’t feed itself. While China is home to nearly 20% of the world’s population, it has less than 10% of the world’s farmable land. As a result, Beijing is forced to go elsewhere for sources of food, especially meat and other forms of protein.

TUCKER CARLSON: WHILE CHINA BUYS UP AMERICAN FARMLAND, WE MAY RUN OUT OF FOOD

And the CCP’s purchases in the U.S. have largely paid off. At the height of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, Smithfield made sure China got the pork it needed – while American groceries stores ran short. By taking our land and food-processing companies for themselves, Chinese communists benefit their own people and gain leverage over the United States in one fell swoop.

But that isn’t the only reason China is putting down roots in the United States. In some cases, they use our land as strategic outposts to steal advanced American seed and farming technology. In other cases, they’ve bought large tracts of land near U.S. military bases.

In North Dakota, a Chinese firm purchased 300 acres a few miles from a U.S. Air Force base, which reportedly is home to America’s most sophisticated military drone technology. The base also has been called ""the backbone of all U.S. military communications across the globe."" Similarly, in Texas, a former Chinese military official purchased over 130,000 acres on the U.S.-Mexico border conspicuously close to Laughlin Air Force Base.

As young Americans move off family farms and their aging parents increasingly retire from the business, China could buy even more. Millions of acres are expected to change hands in the next decade. We must ensure they don’t fall into the clutches of the Chinese Communist Party.

But the communists aren’t just capturing American agricultural land – they’ve also bought an astonishing amount of American real estate. Between 2010 and 2020, the American Realtors Association estimates that Chinese nationals bought over $200 billion worth of American real-estate, more than any other country in the world.

China’s 300,000-plus residential purchases in the United States since 2010 pose an unknown national-security danger, in addition to fueling the rising cost of living in places like California, where a disproportionate number of Chinese nationals buy. For America, allowing China to purchase our land is a lose-lose proposition.

Talk about a find.

A treasure trove of jewels, medallions and historic artifacts has been uncovered in the Bahamas that date back to the legendary 17th century Maravillas shipwreck — and the public can now get a look at it.

Nuestra Señora de las Maravillas (Our Lady of Wonders), a two-deck Spanish galleon, sank on Jan. 4, 1656, off the Little Bahama Bank in the northern Bahamas on a trip to Seville from Cuba.

It had been carrying numerous treasures of both royal tax and private property.

ALL-WOMEN ROWING TEAM BREAKS WORLD RECORD IN RACE ACROSS PACIFIC OCEAN

The 891-ton ship went down after colliding with its fleet flagship.

It struck a reef 30 minutes later — and ultimately sank.

The remains of the vessel were scattered for several miles across the ocean, with no significant portion of the ship left behind.

For more than 360 years, archeologists and adventurers have attempted to locate the debris that was lost in the wreckage.

And while much of the treasure — an estimated 3.5 million pieces, out of eight — was salvaged between 1656 and the early 1990s, modern-day technology tools such as high-resolution magnetometers, enhanced GPS and metal detecting have allowed Allen Exploration to bring to the surface riches beyond the imagination.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, Allen Exploration founder Carl Allen said that he and his team began pulling up precious artifacts in July 2020 near Walker’s Cay.

High-tech tools, plus the official permission they received from the Bahamanian government to search the Northern Bahamas area — known to be a wreckage hotspot — have made for ""quite amazing"" discoveries, the entrepreneur said.

""We’ve recovered thousands of artifacts,"" he said.

""Cannons, anchors, emeralds and amethysts … We’re up to about 3,000 silver coins and 25 gold coins,"" he said.

The water in the area only reaches up to 50 feet deep, while the sand can bury treasures down to 20 feet, he revealed.

Yet that didn’t stop Allen from proving his doubters wrong and discovering treasures that took his breath away.

""When I pulled up the first valuable item, I lost my breath,"" he said. ""I couldn't breathe.""

""I've been thinking about this my whole life.""

The fascinating finds also include Spanish olive jars, Chinese porcelain and iron rigging, according to an AllenX press release.

The team also discovered a silver sword handle belonging to the soldier Don Martin de Aranda y Gusmán; the item helped the teams identify these treasures as belonging to the sunken Maravillas.

One golden pendant with the Cross of Santiago was designed in the shape of a scallop shell.

Four pendants worn by members of the sacred Order of Santiago, a religious band of knights active in Spanish maritime trade, were also recovered.

AllenX considered the Order of Santiago jewels to be the ""star"" finds thus far.

One golden pendant with the Cross of Santiago was designed in the shape of a scallop shell.

It's reinforced by what appears to be an Indian bezoar stone — a famous European stone known for its healing properties.

Another golden pendant garners the same cross overlaying a large, ovular Columbian emerald.

Three gold chains were retrieved, including an 887-gram gold filigree chain made up of 80 circular links and decorated with four-lobed rosette motifs, most likely crafted in the Philippines, the group said.

One golden pendant with the Cross of Santiago was designed in the shape of a scallop shell.

AllenX indicated that no exact replicas of the chain exist from other excavations in museum collections or as seen in Spanish portrait art.

Allen Exploration archeologist Jim Sinclair told Fox News Digital that these artifacts reveal how people lived in the colonial period and in the New World.

As an archeologist of 40 years, and as an original explorer of iconic wrecks such as the Titanic, Sinclair said a recovery such as the one from the Maravillas reflects an ""amazing leap"" in technology.

The archeologist also considered the artifact analysis to be a ""really good development"" in terms of detecting human behavior and history.

Although the worth of these artifacts most likely add up to the millions of dollars, the items are priceless, said Bill Springer, Allen Exploration spokesperson.

None of the Allen Exploration findings will be put up for auction or for sale.

Instead, the finds will become part of an exhibit at Allen Exploration’s Bahamas Maritime Museum, located at the Port Lucaya Marketplace in Freeport.

MIAMI-BOUND BOAT CAPSIZES OFF COAST OF THE BAHAMAS

The museum is set to open on Saturday, Aug. 6, 2022.

It will reveal other exhibits about maritime history in the Bahamas, as well as the transatlantic slave trade and the Lucayan people.

Only 45 survivors

The Maravillas exhibit also showcases the story of the ship’s demise.

Of the nearly 650 passengers who were on board the ship, only 45 are known to have survived.

No human remains have been located.

The shipwreck was a ""tremendous blow,"" Allen explained, since Spain at the time was struggling financially and the boat was jam-packed with valuables.

It was one of the largest treasure ships to have ever left the Indies — which is why Allen said he expects more artifacts to be uncovered still.

The ""mother lode"" has yet to be discovered.

The ""mother lode"" has yet to be discovered, he indicated; and when it is, he said the haul would be ""extremely valuable.""

""The manifest usually on these old ships, a lot of times — it was only about half of what was on the ship because there was so much contraband,"" he said.

""So, that's what's exciting.""

Along with launching the museum, Allen is furthering his passion for discovery and education by developing underwater archeology programs for Bahamian kids.

""The big problem is, [the debris] is not going to stay there forever,"" he said.

""And it’s a playground of shipwreck.""

James Franco is stirring up controversy yet again, with news that he has been cast to play former Cuban leader Fidel Castro in a new film, ""Alina of Cuba,"" according to Deadline. This will be one of Franco's first acting roles since he was sued for sexual misconduct in 2019. But the sexual scandal is not the only reason people are upset with the casting news.

Jennette McCurdy is opening up about her childhood trauma.

McCurdy revealed she was ""exploited"" when she was a child actor on Nickelodeon’s ""iCarly"" and ""Sam & Cat.""

She says her overbearing mother and the television industry were both to blame, as they ""failed to protect her,"" according to the New York Times.

'ICARLY' STAR JENNETTE MCCURDY RECALLS PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL ABUSE FROM MOTHER DURING CHILDHOOD

At the age of 16, McCurdy was entering her third year on the hit teen sitcom ""iCarly,"" where she made millions of young viewers laugh by playing the comedic character Sam Puckett.

The former actress gets candid in her new memoir, ""I’m Glad My Mom Died,"" in which she details her toxic relationship with her mother and her tumultuous time on Nickelodeon.

According to the New York Times, McCurdy, 30, wrote in her memoir about embarrassing moments on the children’s television network when she was asked to be ""photographed in a bikini during a wardrobe fitting and being encouraged to drink alcohol by an intimidating figure she simply calls the Creator.""

McCurdy pointed out that when her mother was present, she never interjected or instructed her daughter that this ""was the price of showbiz success.""

""Everyone wants what you have,"" she allegedly told her daughter.

In McCurdy’s memoir, which will be published on Aug. 9, she recounted auditioning for acting roles at the age of 6 and being ""shepherded"" into the work by her controlling mother. She also noted that she suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders and anxiety. McCurdy believed she owed her loyalty to her mother, who controlled every aspect of her life.

After McCurdy starred on ""iCarly,"" Nickelodeon promised her a spinoff series of her own, but walked back on their offer and made Ariana Grande a co-lead on ""Sam & Cat.""

McCurdy says she felt undermined by the network as they discouraged her from exploring other career opportunities outside the show. However, those rules did not seem to apply to Grande.

""What finally undid me was when Ariana came whistle-toning in with excitement because she had spent the previous evening playing charades at Tom Hanks’s house. That was the moment I broke,"" McCurdy wrote.

""Sam & Cat"" aired for only one season during 2013-2014, and after the show's cancellation, Nickelodeon offered the former actress $300,000 to keep her experiences at the network private, McCurdy said. She refused the offer.

Despite ""iCarly"" star Miranda Cosgrove saying that she and McCurdy quickly became friends on the show, she was not completely aware of the challenges her friend faced in her life.

It is not a converted VW this time around, however. It uses a custom aluminum monocoque chassis with rear independent suspension, rear-wheel drive and seating for two.

Full technical specifications haven't been revealed, but the plan is to offer it with two battery sizes. A 20 kilowatt-hour pack good for 150 miles of driving and a 40 kilowatt-hour pack that will let it cover 300 miles between charges.

THE VW DUNE BUGGY IS BACK FOR AN ELECTRIC FUTURE

The relatively long ranges provided by such small packs is enabled in part by the vehicle's low weight, which is estimated to be around 1,500-1,650 pounds.

The motor that comes with the larger pack will be rated at 202 horsepower and 240 pound-feet of torque, which the company says will allow it to accelerate to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds.

Pricing hasn't yet been announced, and the company hasn't clarified how the vehicle will be legally classified, but it will be offering 50 beta models for sale next year to buyers who agree to provide feedback before full production begins in 2024.

Is it Bigfoot — or a big fluke?

An Ohio woman claims that Sasquatch has returned to the woods near her home, based on an audio recording that she herself made of what she heard.

Suzanne Ferencak shared with Mansfield News Journal last week that this is the first time she’s ever recorded howling in her nearly decade-long tenure as a Bigfoot hunter.

An analyst described the two-minute recording as having ""high potential"" of carrying the sounds of one Bigfoot attempting to contact another, the News Journal reported.

""The first howler has a brassy tone to its voice that can be indicative"" of Sasquatch, the analyst said.

""There are a couple [of] features in the execution, such as shifting to an 'AA' phoneme at the end of the call that are indicative as well, most noticeable in the last two howls.""

Other wildlife experts aren’t so sure the sounds came from a Bigfoot creature, however, according to a USA Today report.

Workers at nearby Mohican State Park suggested that the sounds could’ve come from an alpha male coyote calling its pack.

The Bigfoot enthusiast first spotted the beast in May 2013 when it allegedly hopped over a back road southeast of her hometown of Loudonville, Ohio.

Ferencak told the News Journal that her rural home is prime habitat for Bigfoot and, for several years, experienced knocks and howls around the area — as well as other sightings, she said.

Ferencak finally caught the most recent loud howls on July 3 of this year. She suspects that the sounds came from a young or female Bigfoot calling to her babies.

It's an out-of-this-world project car.

A 1971 Chevrolet Corvette originally driven by Apollo 15 astronaut Al Worden, which was all but forgotten and left to the elements on a used car lot for years, will soon be ready to hit the road again.

The coupe was one of three that were leased to the mission's crew for a year for just $1 each by Melbourne, Florida, Chevrolet dealer and 1960 Indy 500 winner Jim Rathmann.

Rathmann had been leasing Corvettes to astronauts since the Mercury program, fully aware of the promotional value of having American heroes cruising around in his cars, but the Apollo 15 crew was the last.

GENERAL MOTORS BUILDING LUNAR TERRAIN VEHICLE FOR RETURN TO THE MOON

Command module pilot Worden and his crewmates, James Irwin and David Scott, ordered theirs in red, white and blue with coordinating stripes. Worden chose a white one with a 454 cubic-inch V8 under the hood and a Muncie 4-speed manual transmission.

He returned it at the end of the lease, and it was sold into private ownership, changing hands several times and ending up in Texas.

That’s where noted Corvette collector Danny Reed discovered it and added it to his collection in 2017, officially documenting its history in the process.

Reed also owns Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean’s 1969 Corvette, which he purchased directly from GM in 1971, along with Dave Scott’s blue 1971 model. Worden’s car was functional when Reed found it but very weathered from sitting outside for who knows how many years.

Max Kaiserman, the owner of space program merchandise marketplace Luna Replicas and friend of Worden’s, told Fox News Autos that Worden’s grandson, Will Penczak, found out about the car and visited it at Reed’s in 2020. Worden passed away the same year, and Penczak and Reed got to talking about what should happen to the car.

""We want to continue Al Worden’s legacy of inspiring young people to get into science and math and the arts""

Kaiserman and Penczak decided to team up and purchase it; not to fix and flip it at an auction but to become its custodians and share it with the world. They’ve now started Project AstroVette Endeavor and plan to restore it to some extent and use it as an educational tool by displaying it at science museums and other events.

OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD DRIVER EUGENE CERNAN RECOUNTS HIS RIDE ON THE MOON

""We want to continue Al Worden’s legacy of inspiring young people to get into science and math and the arts, all of which the space program and the Corvette represent,"" Kaiserman said.

The 80,000-mile car currently runs and is mostly-rust free, but it’s had some minor repairs and a few parts replaced over the years, so they’re still deciding what to do with it. Whether to preserve it as-is or bring it back to as close to original condition as possible.

A refresh to the standards of the National Corvette Restorers Society could run over $100,000, according to Kaiserman, while an extensive rotisserie show car-quality restoration might cost a quarter-million or more.

They’re open to any support for the project and are also asking anyone with photos of the car from the 1970s to share them to help get a better sense of its original condition, right down to what tires were on it when Worden had it. As of now, they only have one photo from Life magazine featuring the three astronauts and their cars parked behind the mission's Lunar Roving Vehicle, which was the first to go to the moon.

""How incredible is that the first astronauts to drive on the moon were also the last to drive Rathmann Corvettes,"" Kaiserman said.

""There's a very real prospect for a fourth year and potentially a fifth year of drought,"" Ekdahl told Fox News.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has mishandled California's severe, years-long drought during his time in office, while the state's farms face diminishing yields, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News.

""I think Gavin Newsom has failed when it comes to water,"" McCarthy, who represents a district in California's Central Valley, said.

For the second time in nine years, California is facing a generational drought – a period of dryness so severe, they're typically thought to only occur once per generation, according to Erik Ekdahl, the California State Water Resources Control Board's deputy director for water rights. The Golden State has also endured a megadrought – a drought that lasts longer than 20 years – since 2000, Ekdahl said.

""I think the state has actually done some remarkably good planning and preparation and implementation for drought,"" Ekdahl told Fox News.

DROUGHT-PARCHED WEST LOOKS TO MIGHTY MISSISSIPPI FOR SOLUTIONS TO WATER CRISIS

Regardless, farmers' yields and, consequently, their businesses, are suffering, said Sam Parnagian, a third generation California Central Valley farmer. Over one-third of the country's vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts are grown in California, according to the state Department of Food and Agriculture.

""You'll go see tens of thousands of acres that used to have nuts, almonds, pistachios, and they're just bare,"" Parnagian told Fox News. ""It's just all dust.""

California saw a brief reprieve from drought in 2019, just months after Newsom took office, according to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Drought Center. But by 2021, the state was once again plunged into severe dryness on a wide scale – and it could get worse.

""There's a very real prospect for a fourth year and potentially a fifth year of drought,"" Ekdahl told Fox News.

Newsom, a Democrat, needed to use the drought-free period to prepare, McCarthy said.

""You should store it in the abundant years to have it for the years coming forward when it comes to drought,"" McCarthy, a Republican, told Fox News. ""That would show you good management.""

McCarthy's district includes part of Kern County, 70% of which is characterized as facing ""exceptional"" drought conditions, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Exceptional drought, the most intense and devastating type of drought, can lead to widespread wildlife death, the removal of orchards, increased chances of wildfire and low crop yields, according to NOAA.

LAS VEGAS 'WATER COPS' PATROL FOR WATER WASTERS AMID UNPRECEDENTED DROUGHT

Newsom outlined a 142-step plan in 2020 to make California more resilient to drought. It included long-term projects such as new water storage construction, surveying for new water sources and the deconstruction of dams.

Many of those haven't been built, according to a progress report published in January. Ekdahl said many of the water projects could take years to be completed.

""They haven't built any new water storage, no new dams,"" McCarthy told Fox News. They continue to let water go out into the ocean.""

Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment.

""The Governor has worked with the legislature to invest $8 billion to implement the strategies in the Water Resilience Portfolio , which focuses on diversifying our water supplies, enhancing ecosystems, improving infrastructure and ensuring California is better able to manage hotter and drier weather"" Erin Mellon, a Newsom spokesperson, told the Los Angeles Times in July.

CALIFORNIA REDUCES SUPPLIES TO WATER AGENCIES AMID DROUGHT

But others agreed with McCarthy.

""These days, the Newsom administration and Legislature have done little more than engage in water shaming,"" Steven Greenhut, the R Street Institute's western region director, wrote in the Orange County Register. ""Where are the plans to bolster our water-storage capacities?""

Newsom in 2021 asked Californians to voluntarily cut water use by 15%, but in March 2022, usage increased by 19%. The governor threatened to make restrictions mandatory in response.

""There’s no need to shame Westerners for their water usage, but there is reason to shame our officials for not doing their part to upgrade and build new water infrastructure,"" Greenhut wrote, noting that Newsom should use California's nearly $100 billion surplus to invest in water facilities. He also blamed former Gov. Jerry Brown for inaction during another drought reprieve when he was in office.

Yet Newsom has also faced criticism for not imposing harsher restrictions.

""We know it’s an election year and Newsom doesn’t want to anger voters, but failing to impose mandatory water cuts in the midst of this crisis demonstrates a stunning lack of leadership,"" the Mercury News and East Bay Times editorial boards wrote.

HOUSE APPROVES BILL TO HELP WEST FIGHT WILDFIRES, DROUGHT

About 80% of water use in California is used for agriculture, according to the state Department of Water Resources.

""We're one of the most fertile lands in all the world, and we should be using it to maximize our industry here in California and food for the world,"" Parnagian told Fox News.

But the drought has even restricted farmers' water usage, consequently lowering their economic output, according to Ekdahl.

Some livestock farmers have even had to sell their cattle, a move that could cause beef prices to surge, FOX Business previously reported.

""You're seeing that people are starting to farm to the water that's available,"" Parnagian told Fox News. ""And in doing that, we're limited on the crops we can grow. We're limited on the yields that we can get.""

California rice producers are weighing importing from Japan and South Korea as domestic production has severely dropped, S&P Global Commodity Insights reported.

The former climate and conservation manager for the California State Water Resources Control Board, Max Gomberg, also felt Newsom wasn't properly handling water resiliency. But Gomberg, who said he left his post because the governor wasn't aggressive enough on climate change, felt agriculture has received preferential treatment.

""There are the zillions of acres of almonds and grapes. It’s not sustainable,"" Gomberg told the LA Times. ""Everyone knows it’s not sustainable, just like everyone knows the amount of withdrawals from the shrinking Colorado River system are not sustainable.""

Meanwhile, only five of California's 17 major reservoirs, which provide water for agricultural use, are over 50% capacity, and eight are below 35% capacity, according to the California Department of Water Resources.

""What we're seeing just over the last nine years or so, seven of the last nine years have been dry or critically dry,"" Ekdahl told Fox News. ""That's just put long-term stress on our reservoirs, how we use water and ecosystems and people that depend on it."""

Three comics separately said freedom of speech will prevail over a small, but vocal group of cancel culture warriors aiming to censor comedians.

""Comedians just need to stop buying into all the noise, and they need to just start telling jokes how they want,"" Tyler Fischer, a New York stand-up comic, told Fox News. ""You're never going to develop as an artist unless you cross the line.""

Comedians, like Dave Chappelle, have been high-profile targets of cancel culture in recent years. Most recently, Minneapolis' First Avenue canceled Chappelle's sold out show hours before his set time after the storied venue faced backlash from its staff and community over the superstar comedian's jokes about the transgender community.

""Too often, too much credit is given to the way people interpret what you're saying or what you're doing as a comedian rather than what your real intentions are,"" Josh Denny, a Los Angeles comedian, told Fox News.

DAVE CHAPPELLE COMEDY SPECIAL QUIETLY RELEASED ON NETFLIX FOLLOWING ‘THE CLOSER’ TRANSPHOBIC JOKE CONTROVERSY

""When venues like First Avenue cave to the mob, that's what's dangerous,"" Denny continued. ""That basically tells all those transgender people that what they think Dave Chappelle saying about them is true, and that's not the case at all.""

The comedians told Fox News they believed the people aiming to censor comedians represented a small, but over-pronounced portion of America.

""We've just inflamed the very small minority of people who are sensitive and giving them superpowers,"" Fischer said. ""I don't think America has gotten too sensitive.""

Denny similarly said: ""The people that want to censor comedy or cancel comedians who are being edgy, taking risks, pushing the envelope, I think they're a very, very organized, vocal minority of people. There really is a clamoring and I think a resurgence of audiences that just don't want politically correct comedy anymore.""

Chrissie Mayr, a New York stand-up comic, told Fox News that censoring comedians is ""the most selfish thing you can do.""

""It's like 'Oh, I don't like this comedian … Not only do I not want to see them, but I want to make sure nobody else can see them,'"" she said.

JOHN CLEESE SAYS WOKENESS HAS A ‘DISASTROUS’ IMPACT ON COMEDY

Yet comedians have altered their jokes to align with shifting societal norms throughout history, Kliph Nesteroff, a comedy historian, has written.

""The tug of war between censorship and free speech has been part of comedy for its entire existence,"" Nesteroff wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed. ""It is likely to continue.""

He provided examples of 20th century comedians getting arrested or banned for their jokes.

Still, Fischer said modern cancel culture censored his own comedy for nearly a decade out of fear.

""I've been terrified to kind of step outside of that, you know, woke bubble,"" he said.

Over 80% of adults surveyed in a New York Times/Siena College poll in February said they felt it was a serious problem that some Americans wouldn't practice their freedom of speech out of fear of retaliation or harsh criticism. An April Morning Consult poll found that roughly one-third of adults felt they couldn't speak freely on social media.

Fischer also told Fox News he saw a shift once he began making of President Biden's age and low energy.

""I'd make fun of Donald Trump for four years,"" he said while impersonating the former president. ""Then, I made fun of Biden, and they're like, oh, you're far-right.""

NEWSWEEK COLUMN CALLS CHAPPELLE STAND-UP SHOW CANCELLATION ‘A VICTORY FOR CONFORMITY’

""I make fun of who is in power,"" Fischer continued. ""The left has gone so far that now anything sort of nuanced, in the middle, non-censored is considered far-right.""

The Media Research center identified more than 600 instances of social media users facing bans, restrictions or deleted content over posts criticizing Biden between March 2020 and March 2022. The Morning Consult poll found that half of Republicans didn't feel they could speak freely on social media compared to less than 20% of Democrats.

""We have almost this religious crusade now with the political sides over who is right and who is wrong,"" Denny, who has performed stand-up for 17 years, told Fox News.

""Everyone has some line, some sacred cow, that they believe is not okay to make fun of,"" Denny continued. ""And that could be their politics, it could be their religious beliefs, could be any of those things.""

Denny, Fischer and Mayr argued that protecting some groups can actually lead to more exclusion in comedy.

Chappelle has repeatedly faced criticism over his jokes about the transgender community. His Netflix special, ""The Closer,"" led to the tech giant's staff walking out in protest, though CEO Ted Sarandos defended the decision to provide Chappelle with a platform.

""Comedy is like the most inclusive thing,"" Fischer told Fox News. ""You can't slowly start cutting out topics and people that you can't joke about.""

Denny said: ""I will either make fans or not based on the kind of content I do, but I'd rather take the tortoise race to the finish of making the kind of fans I want than just doing what's easy to appease people."""

It was a telling indication of how involved and accessible the casino's next president plans to be.

Hired in June as Hard Rock's general manager, Faranca is being boosted to the top job now that current president Joe Lupo is heading to Las Vegas to run the Mirage casino once the company completes its purchase.

INFLATION CAUSE FOR 'CONCERN' AS TRAVEL-RELATED COSTS SOAR: HARD ROCK INTERNATIONAL CHAIRMAN

He's being handed the city's No. 2 casino in terms of money won from in-person gamblers (No. 3 when internet and sports betting money are included); a resort that has upped the city's game in terms of live entertainment.

But Faranca's gaze extends beyond the casino's walls to the city around it: He's been meeting with city officials on safety and cleanliness initiatives, pledges to continue Hard Rock's history of supporting charitable and community groups, and realizes the casino's success or failure rests squarely on the shoulders of its employees.

That's why late on a busy Saturday night, with a million other things to keep track of, he was huddling with the cleaning staff.

""I make it a point to go to pre-shift meetings with all the different departments, to thank them for what they do and connect with them,"" Faranca said.

A Philadelphia native, Faranca began his casino career in Atlantic City as a guest services manager at Harrah's and the Showboat. He worked in general manager roles at Philadelphia's Parx casino, the Palms in Las Vegas and at Maryland Live!, where he also was executive vice president, before joining Hard Rock.

Faranca says he has five core principles he plans to follow in his new job: Be the employer of choice in your market. Deliver exceptional hospitality. Clearly understand your property's strategy. Focus on the community. Have a commitment from ownership.

The casino is considering doing some hotel room and suite upgrades, and plans to diversify its entertainment lineup even more, he said.

Jim Allen, the global chairman of Hard Rock, has long pushed Atlantic City officials to make the city safer and cleaner, and has not hesitated to call them out when he feels conditions are poor. Faranca has already picked up that baton.

""I hope everyone rallies behind the idea of a safe and clean Atlantic City,"" he said. ""When guests visit the city, they need a safe visit.""

He has already had discussions with City Councilman Kaleem Shabazz about the need for safety and cleanliness in the city, and will serve on the board of the Atlantic City Police Department Foundation.

""He is very sincere and open to working with government,"" Shabazz said. ""He seems to have a good sense of how a partnership should go and what issues in the community should be dealt with. I feel a strong sense of his community engagement.""

CELEB CHEF GUY FIERI TAKES HIS CHICKEN JOINTS TO COUNTRY MUSIC’S CAPITAL

How much money does Guy Fieri make from television?

Last year, the chef reportedly signed an $80 million contract with the Food Network to host his two shows over the course of a three-year period. The new deal is a $30 million raise from Fieri's prior deal of $50 million, according to Forbes.

Fieri rakes in approximately $26 million per year, which is more than his competitor celebrity chefs such as Emeril Lagasse, who was paid $8 million, and Gordon Ramsay, who earned around $20 million last year. His signature show, ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dive"" first aired in 2006 and, after 33 seasons, earned more than $230 million in advertising revenue in 2020.

""I got a chance of a lifetime,"" Fieri told the Hollywood Reporter in the wake of the deal. ""I think I played it good.""

How did Guy Fieri rise to fame?

The $80 million deal represents a new level of success for Fieri who for most of his career was looked down upon by other celebrity chefs for his humble origins and simple tastes. Fieri started in the food industry at 10 years old and sold pretzels out of a stand. In France, he studied cooking and later moved to Las Vegas to attend the University of Nevada for hospitality management.

In 2006, Fieri was able to host his own show on the Food Network after winning in the second season of ""Next Food Network Star."" The show, ""Guy's Big Bite, only lasted for six episodes and Fieri earned approximately $1,000 per episode.

However, by 2010 the Ohio native was one of the most popular stars on the network when he premiered in Diners, Driven Ins, and Dives. The show follows Fieri on the road across the United States, Canada, and Mexico as he eats unique foods from popular local diners, drive-in restaurants, and dive bars.

By 2019, Fieri, along with the late Julia Child, became the fourth celebrity chef to be awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has been featured in more than 14 series on the Food Network.

As a parent, you have two main options to help pay for your child’s college expenses: Parent PLUS Loans and private student loans .

The federal government offers Parent PLUS Loans and they come with unique benefits. Private loans come from private lenders, and they may have lower interest rates if you have good credit.

In this article, we’ll go over the main differences between the two types of loans to help you figure out which may be right for you.



Credible lets you compare private student loan rates from multiple lenders, all in one place.

Parent PLUS Loans vs. private parent loans

Both Parent PLUS Loans and private parent loans give you the opportunity to borrow money for your child’s higher education expenses. But they differ significantly in how interest rates are set and how you’ll repay them.

Parent PLUS Loans

The U.S. Department of Education offers Parent PLUS Loans, which are more formally known as Direct PLUS Loans. Graduate or professional students can take these loans out, as well as parents of undergraduate students.

You generally apply for these loans online through the StudentAid.gov website . In most cases, you won’t qualify if you have an adverse credit history, like a bankruptcy or foreclosure in the last five years or a history of late or missed payments.

Parent PLUS Loans have a fixed interest rate set by the federal government, which is currently 7.54%. That means the interest rate won’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You’re able to borrow up to the full cost of attendance, as determined by your child’s school, minus any other financial aid the student receives. When you take out the loan, you’ll also pay a fee of 4.228% of the loan amount. To pay the fee, the government will deduct a portion of the funds from each loan payout.

Private parent loans

Private parent student loans have no standard requirements. Instead, individual lenders set their own qualifications, interest rates, and repayment terms. But in general, lenders determine the interest rate based on your credit score. People with higher credit scores will qualify for lower rates, while people with poor credit will get higher rates, if they qualify.

You may find private parent loans with fixed or variable rates. Variable-rate loans typically begin with a lower APR, but this rate can rise over time. Fixed-rate loans don’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You usually have the option to make full principal and interest payments while your child is in school, or you can make interest-only payments to keep the interest from building up. Most private parent loans must be repaid within 15 years, though loan terms may be shorter depending on the lender.

The best private parent loans feature zero loan fees. Just like with Parent PLUS Loans, you’re solely responsible for repaying a private parent loan.

Cosigned student loans

A third option for helping your child pay for their college education is by cosigning their student loan. When you do this, your child is the primary borrower on the loan but you’re agreeing to be responsible for repaying the loan if your child defaults.

You may consider cosigning a private student loan with your child. In many cases, students aren’t able to qualify for a loan on their own since they may have little or no credit history. By cosigning, lenders take your credit into account as well. Any missed payments will hurt both your credit and your child’s. Many lenders offer a cosigner release option, which allows you to remove yourself from the loan once your child has made a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments.

A cosigner usually isn’t required on federal student loans.

When does it make sense to take out a Parent PLUS Loan?

A Parent PLUS Loan may make the most sense if you have fair credit. With these federal loans, the interest rate is the same no matter your credit score. If you don’t have any major credit problems, but your score simply isn’t the best, you may get a lower rate on a Parent PLUS Loan than you would on a private loan.

A Parent PLUS Loan may also be the best choice if you want to take advantage of one of the unique repayment plans the government offers:

Standard Repayment Plan — This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years.

This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years. Extended Repayment Plan — This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan.

This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan. Graduated Repayment Plan — This plan can help if you expect to have a higher income in the future. Your payments start low, but rise over time. Ideally, your income would grow along with your payment. You also have up to 10 years to repay your loan under this plan.

If your payments are still too high, you may have the option to combine all the Parent PLUS Loans you have into a federal Direct Consolidation Loan, which gives you the option of enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. With these plans, your monthly payment is capped at a certain percentage of your discretionary income. This can be a great option if your discretionary income is relatively low.

When does it make sense to take out a private parent student loan?

If your child has exhausted all their scholarship, grant, and federal loan options, and if you have excellent credit, a private parent student loan may make the most sense. You’ll likely be able to qualify for a lower rate than what you’d receive with a Parent PLUS Loan, saving you money in interest.

Private loans may also make sense if you’d like to choose a variable interest rate. This option gives you a lower initial rate, though it can rise over time. If you expect to pay off the loan quickly, though, you may be able to keep the lower interest rate and pay off the loan before it rises."

Fascination with outer space and space creatures existed long before movie magic and popular culture created ""E.T.,"" ""Star Wars"" or even the ""Alien"" franchise. The final frontier has been a source of endless conspiracy and controversy for decades.

Now, Fox Nation's ""Alien Abductions"" hosted by Abby Hornacek unpacks some of the most legendary alien encounters and introduces people around the country who claim to have been abducted by extraterrestrial beings.

One of the several stories featured in the six-part series that Hornacek traces is the mysterious invention of The Integratron by George Van Tassel, a legendary alien abductee and ufologist who lived in the Mojave Desert in California.



Van Tassel is largely considered to be one of the first contactees with aliens and, in many ways, is said to have kicked off a movement in 1950s America after allegedly encountering an alien from Venus named Solganda.

The new Fox Nation series unpacks Van Tassel's story of meeting Solganda, who supposedly gave extraterrestrial instructions to Van Tassel on how to build an immortality device.

This device became known as The Integratron, which he considered a time machine and a healing device.

Alabama is one of 15 states that do not ask voters to register with a political party ahead of a voting in a primary. Some Republicans argue it’s time to change that.

The Alabama Republican Party will take a vote this weekend on whether to support a party registration requirement for primaries, also known as having a closed primary. Passage of the resolution would signal support for the idea, but the Alabama Legislature would have to enact legislation to make such a change.

""I very much expect it to pass,"" Alabama Republican Party Chairman John Wahl said of the party resolution. The state GOP approved a similar resolution in 2016.

Currently, voters casting ballots in a primary election in Alabama simply tell a poll worker which ballot they want. Wahl said there is growing concern about possible cross-over voting. Republicans should be electing Republican nominees, he said.

Wahl said the resolution endorses the idea of a closed primary, but doesn't recommend any specific method. States have different rules regarding primary voting and party registration.

Only nine states have completely closed primaries where a voter seeking to vote in a closed primary must first be a registered party member, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Ferry riders in Seattle and the Puget Sound area have seen their fair share of woes.

Wildlife advocates sued federal officials Tuesday after the government missed a deadline to decide if protections for gray wolves should be restored across the northern U.S. Rocky Mountains, where Republican-led states have made it easier to kill the predators.

""The hand that reaches for any of this wealth will be severed,"" Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah in Lebanon, said during televised remarks in Beirut Tuesday, according to Radio France Internationale (RFI).

Congress passed it on June 13 and it was ratified by the requisite 28 of then-37 states on July 9, 1868.

Second, giving up Viktor Bout to the Russians would harm American security.
President Biden must prioritize American interests and security by keeping Viktor Bout in jail.","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

President Joe Biden recently stated that his administration will ""pursue every possible avenue"" to bring U.S. citizens Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan home to the United States. Griner, a women’s basketball star, was sentenced last week by a Russian court to nine years in prison for marijuana possession, a crime in Russia for which she had pleaded guilty. Whelan is serving a 16-year jail term in Russia on espionage charges, accused of receiving and possessing classified information on a USB drive.

Secretary of State Anthony Blinken confirmed on Friday that the United States put forward a ""substantial proposal"" to Putin’s regime for a prisoner exchange, which reportedly would entail releasing Viktor Bout, a dangerous Russian arms trafficker, back to Russia in exchange for Griner and Whelan.

Bad idea.

Here are the top three reasons why this potential deal is not in U.S. interests and should not take place.

BRITTNEY GRINER'S SENTENCE PUTS SPOTLIGHT BACK ON STRAINED US-RUSSIA RELATIONS

First, the deal would embolden Putin to continue using ""hostage diplomacy"" to achieve his anti-American agenda. The Biden administration may bring two Americans home, scoring much needed political points -- at a time the president’s popularity is at historic lows -- but it will endanger many more Americans in the future and harm U.S. security. For years, the Russian government has used prisoner exchanges to retrieve Russian intelligence operatives, cyber criminals, and other types of Russian citizens held in U.S. prisons. Typically, however, the Russians get away with extorting much more valuable Russian nationals, in exchange for ordinary Americans who break Russian law, sometimes unwittingly. The Russians have perfected this playbook.

In April, the Biden administration exchanged a former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed, who was serving a 9-year sentence in a Russian labor camp, after being convicted of assaulting two Russian police officers while drunk on a visit to Moscow. The Russians got back Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot who was arrested by US special forces in 2010 in Liberia and sentenced to 20 years of prison time in US jail in 2011 for conspiring to smuggle more than $100 million worth of cocaine into the United States.

In 2021, the Biden administration quietly deported back to Russia the world’s most dangerous cybercriminal, Alexei Burkov, who had been sentenced to nine years in prison in America. An elite hacker, Burkov operated a website, which sold stolen numbers of credit and debit cards and extorted millions of dollars in ransom from US businesses, in return for unlocking infected computer networks. No Americans appear to have been released by the Russians, and there’s a congressional investigation underway to determine if the Biden Administration got anything in return.

In 2010, the Obama administration released ten Russian spies who had been infiltrated into the United States by Russian intelligence Service, the SVR, ten years earlier. These deep cover agents posed as Americans, blending into regular American day-to-day life, with the goal of penetrating top echelons of U.S. government in order to influence U.S. politics. Some of the sleeper agents in this spy ring got close to infiltrating Hillary Clinton’s circle. The U.S. government did not rescue any Americans out of Russia in exchange for these Russian sleeper agents. Instead, it brought in just four Russian citizens – one nuclear scientist, two intelligence operatives, and one KGB agent – who had been jailed by the Russians for providing secrets to U.S. government.

Second, giving up Viktor Bout to the Russians would harm American security. Bout is not just a regular Russian criminal. He is a high-value asset for the Russians, having ties to Russian spy services and indirect links to Putin himself. Bout is the world’s most prolific international arms trafficker and is serving a 25-year federal sentence for conspiring to kill Americans. This former military intelligence officer was conspiring to sell millions of dollars-worth of weaponry and 10 million rounds of ammunition to a Colombian narco-terrorist organization before he was arrested in a sting operation by U.S. law enforcement officers.

Bout has already spent 15 years in prison and has been thoroughly interrogated by US officers. As a highly trained military intelligence officer, he is also a gifted linguist with command of five languages. Bout undoubtedly has critical insights to share with his former comrades in Russian intelligence about what he experienced in the hands of U.S. debriefers and what was of interest to them.

Bout is connected to a Putin ally, Igor Sechin, who is a former deputy prime minister of Russia and currently the CEO of Rosneft, Russia’s state-owned energy conglomerate. Despite being isolated in a prison cell for over a decade, Bout never gave up his connection the Sechin, a fellow intelligence operative with whom he had served in the Soviet military running operations abroad.

Finally, by giving up Viktor Bout, President Biden would waste millions of dollars from the U.S. intelligence budget and demoralize dozens and possibly hundreds of American law enforcement officers, intelligence analysts, and support personnel who made it possible to capture this criminal. U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) officers finally arrested him in a hotel in Thailand in 2008 after almost a decade-long operation. Similarly, it took ten years of scrupulous work by US counter-intelligence to nab Putin’s spy ring of sleeper agents in 2010. With a stroke of a pen President Biden, and Obama before him, undid all that hard and often dangerous work by U.S. officers.

The Russians are acutely aware of President Biden’s naïveté, weakness, and his self-interest at a time his domestic popularity is at historical lows. They have floated the idea of adding another Russian criminal to the Griner-Whelan-Bout swap – Vadim Krasikov, another Russian spy who was sentenced to life in prison in Germany for having assassinated a former Chechen fighter on German soil.

President Biden must prioritize American interests and security by keeping Viktor Bout in jail."

""Equal Justice Under Law"" is engraved on the ornate pediment above the entrance to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Department of Justice and the FBI continue to hurl eggs at it.

Monday’s pre-dawn raid by a battalion of FBI agents on former President Donald Trump’s Florida home represents an abandonment of the cherished principle embedded in our Constitution that the law will be equally applied to all of its citizens.

Instead, political status now dictates whether a person receives fair treatment in a supposedly fair justice system.

If you check the box marked ""Republican"" on a political affiliation form, brace yourself for persecution and prosecution. If you check ""Democrat,"" you’ll be granted special elevated status. You’re untouchable. Just ask Hillary Clinton and Hunter Biden.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA ‘UNDER SIEGE’ BY FBI AGENTS

The evidence is indisputable that Clinton, while serving as secretary of State, converted tens of thousands of government records to her private email server in the basement of her home. In simple terms, she was stealing. She committed at least 110 crimes under the Espionage Act, representing the number of documents that the FBI determined were classified and top secret. She jeopardized America’s national security by exposing vital secrets to our enemies. The State Department discovered her computer was successfully hacked.

But that’s not all. When Congress instructed Clinton to preserve all of her documents, she destroyed more than 30,000 of them while wiping her server clean by using file-deleting software. Her mobile devices were broken in half or demolished with hammers. Her willful destruction of government property constituted another set of crimes, including obstruction.

Did the FBI ever raid Clinton’s home in Chappaqua, New York, to seize the incriminating evidence she kept there? No. Just the opposite occurred. Without authority, then-FBI Director James Comey absolved Clinton despite overwhelming evidence of criminality that he spelled out in his infamous July 5, 2016, news conference.

Months later, when Comey was fired for usurping the power of the attorney general, he stole government documents from the FBI. He did it for the admitted purpose of leaking them to the media to trigger the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Trump over phony allegations of Russian ""collusion"" that Hillary invented and the FBI exploited. We know how that capacious witch hunt turned out.

Did the FBI ever raid Comey’s home to retrieve the documents he pilfered? Did the DOJ charge him with theft of government property? Of course not. Don’t be silly.

This brings us to Hunter Biden. His notorious laptop contains a trove of damning documents and emails that offer compelling evidence of multiple enrichment schemes with foreign entities that forked over millions of dollars for access to Joe Biden and the power he wielded as vice president. Instead of a multiple count indictment for influence peddling, money laundering, tax fraud and foreign lobbying crimes, a four-year investigation has produced nothing.

RAID ON TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO HOME BY BIDEN'S POLITICIZED FBI MEANS US NOW A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY

Did the FBI ever raid Hunter’s home to obtain additional evidence? Or Joe Biden’s home, since the laptop implicates him as involved in his son’s profiteering scams? You know the answer. Don’t be dense.

The FBI doesn’t abide by the law when Democrats are involved. The agency obstructs it. They’re running a protection racket for the Bidens.

Recently we learned that ""highly credible whistleblowers"" within the bureau exposed an internal ""scheme"" by senior officials to bury evidence of Hunter’s corruption by falsely portraying the laptop’s contents as ""disinformation"" from foreign intelligence sources. Those same officials then allegedly sealed the truth in a file that only they could access.

Don’t forget – the FBI had the computer in its possession since December 2019 and knew it was real. The contents were fully analyzed and overflowing with evidence of influence peddling. But the agency and the Justice Department kept it under wraps, taking no action to charge or prosecute.

Ten months later when news of the laptop broke, 51 former intelligence agents publicly bashed it as Russian disinformation. The FBI knew it was a lie that the bureau helped invent. So, officials remained mute to help Biden get elected.

FBI Director Christopher Wray has done nothing to clean up his cesspool of an agency. He seems more interested in covering up acts of malfeasance and misfeasance. But the FBI is not alone in abusing its powers to protect partisan allies and punish political adversaries. The whistleblowers have also identified a top official within Merrick Garland’s Justice Department who has done the same.

The attorney general, who was appointed by Biden, is overseeing the investigation of his boss’ son. To the extent that the president was a participant and beneficiary in Hunter’s schemes, Garland has a disqualifying double conflict of interest. Yet, he has refused to appoint a neutral special counsel even though it is mandatory under federal regulations.

Garland despises Republicans for denying him a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. Covering up for a Democratic president is his vengeance. He’s the attorney general in name only. Like Robert Duvall’s character in ""The Godfather,"" Garland serves as Biden’s ""consigliere."" He’s Joe’s protector, by hook or by crook.

As long as Garland and Wray preside over our nation’s law enforcement, ""Equal Justice Under Law"" is a farce."

Bob Barnes, the man who is cycling to all 50 U.S. state capitals, reached capital number 42 of St. Paul as he nears the close of his cross-country journey — which began almost one year ago.

Barnes, 52, of Syracuse, N.Y., told Fox News Digital that while he faced some negative interactions with locals, the trip took a pleasant turn in the outskirts of the Minnesota city.

""There are some areas of Minnesota where people are uptight,"" said Barnes, who reached St. Paul on May 20.

""The only thing consistent about Minnesota is the terrain,"" he added. ""It’s been really easy to travel out here.""

""I was disappointed in Saint Paul,"" Barnes later added.

At a laundromat where he was washing and drying his clothes and shoes, a woman approached him and ""demanded that I put my shoes on,"" Barnes said.

""It was just a simple interaction — but those are the things that I base all my observations on,"" Barnes said.

Barnes said that after he left St. Paul, everything changed for him about 30 miles outside the city.

""Here I am with my head down. I’m feeling dejected,"" he said, describing his mood at that time.

""And now, people are starting to come up to me, all talkative and inquisitive with a whole different vibe. It was really weird.""

""The people up there were actually more … inquisitive than anywhere else,"" Barnes added.

""There were so many cyclists and everybody just, one after the other, pulled up from behind me and just, ‘Oh, where are you going, what are you doing?’ And we’d stop and talk and that turned me around back to being in a good mood.""

""When you’re with somebody, they’re easy miles,"" Barnes said. ""It’s easy to pedal. You don’t realize you’re pedaling. You’re just having a conversation and moving along nice.""

Major milestone for this cyclist

While in Minnesota, Barnes reached another milestone: crossing the Mississippi River one last time.

Barnes ended up crossing the Mississippi River a total of nine times on his trip, which began back on Aug. 1, 2021 — a year ago.

""It’s actually pretty cool,"" Barnes said. ""To cross the Mississippi River nine times on nine different bridges on one trip is fun.""

Staying in a casino

During one of his last nights in Minnesota, a follower of Barnes gifted him a room stay at a casino resort.

The follower works as a security guard at the casino and offered Barnes a $25 voucher for dinner along with his room.

""The casino — that was terrific,"" Barnes said. ""That’s kind of like what I needed.""

""The only thing I gambled was — they give you a card with $5 on it that I turned into $11 and then spent it.""

He added, ""But I don’t gamble. I feel too guilty if I gamble.""

A Virginia-based disaster relief and humanitarian aid organization traveled to eastern Kentucky over the weekend to cook and deliver hot meals to those in need following last week's deadly flash flooding.

Mercy Chefs — founded by longtime chef Gary LeBlanc — has been serving millions of chef-prepared meals during national emergencies and natural disasters since the aftermath of Katrina in 2006.

Their efforts began just days after Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear issued a state of emergency due to the severe flooding that killed dozens and displaced many others.

After the team arrived in Whitesburg on Saturday, they heard stories of families who were thankful to be alive after nearly being swept away in the devastating floods.

Beshear said on Monday that the death toll climbed to 30 following the storms, flooding and mudslides that began early last week. He also noted that the death toll would likely increase as search and rescue operations continued.

Some people stranded on rooftops are still waiting to be rescued, and more than 23,000 households are currently without power, Beshear said in an update about the catastrophic flooding.

""Over the last few days, Eastern Kentucky communities faced the most destructive flooding in the state’s history,"" Mercy Chefs Facebook post read. ""The death toll continues to rise as search and rescue teams continue their work, and now there is more rain in the forecast this week.""

Mercy Chefs and its band of more than 25 volunteers have already served nearly 2,000 hot meals to victims and first responders on Sunday after setting up at Letcher County Central High School.

The team plans to serve hot lunches and dinner at the high school as well as distribute meals to multiple rural locations.

""It’s times like this that we feel so blessed to have bases strategically placed across the country,"" said LeBlanc.

For the last 16 years, LeBlanc and his team at Mercy Chefs have traveled to more than 150 disaster zones in 29 states and 12 countries.

And the Ford EcoSport took the long journey from India to showrooms before it was discontinued this year.

But there are also plenty of cars that are made in the USA that might not be so obvious.

Here are a few that are hiding in plain sight:

SUBARU OUTBACK

It may have an Australian name and come from a Japanese company, but the Subaru Outback is built right in the heartland in Lafayette, Indiana, alongside the Ascent, Legacy and Impreza.

The Outback is the brand's best-selling car so far in 2022.

ACURA NSX

The Acura NSX has the sleek lines and technology of an exotic machine, but the mid-engine hybrid sports car was designed in the USA and has been built at Honda's Performance Manufacturing Center in Marysville, Ohio since 2016.

Olivia Newton-John’s only daughter is mourning the loss of the beloved singer.



The Grammy-winning superstar passed away on Monday at her southern California ranch, her husband John Easterling confirmed on Instagram and Facebook. She was 73.



Chloe Lattanzi also took to social media, where she shared a series of sweet photos featuring herself and the late ""Grease"" star from over the years. One of the heartfelt snapshots was a smiling selfie of mother and daughter.



While the post wasn’t captioned, the 36-year-old shared a photo of the pair just three days ago. Newton-John is seen beaming as she stands proudly next to her daughter.

""I worship this woman,"" Lattanzi captioned that post. ""My mother. My best friend.""



In May 2017, Newton-John revealed that she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her back. In 2021, she described how Lattanzi was been by her side.



""I’m so lucky to still be doing all these things,"" Newton-John told People magazine about attending Lattanzi’s wedding and releasing a single with her called ""Window in the Wall.""



""I don’t think I imagined living this long!"" she said. ""I feel very blessed.""

The outlet revealed that while both women have always been close, their bond only grew stronger while they quarantined in California together during the coronavirus pandemic. While Lattanzi later moved to Portland, Oregon, she revealed in late July that she had moved back to be near her mother.



""I worked my whole life, and the longest period I can remember being home was my pregnancy with Chloe and the first year or two of her life,"" Newton-John reflected. ""So it’s been wonderful reconnecting with my baby. She is my reason to be.""



In 2016, Lattanzi opened up to the outlet about what it was like growing up with Newton-John.



""As a kid, I wasn’t paying attention to her as a celebrity,"" she explained. ""She’s my mom, you know? Like, she takes me to school. I think as I’ve gotten older, that’s when I got to listening to her music. I did a re-imagining of ‘Magic’ because I loved it so much.""

From 1973 to 1983, Newton-John was among the world’s most popular entertainers. She had 14 top 10 singles just in the U.S., won four Grammys, starred with John Travolta in ""Grease"" and with Gene Kelly in ""Xanadu."" The fast-stepping Travolta-Newton-John duet, ""You’re the One That I Want,"" was one of the era’s biggest songs and has sold more than 15 million copies.



""Physical,"" the bouncy, R-rated smash released in 1981, was No. 1 for 10 weeks and was named Billboard’s song of the year despite being banned by some radio stations. An aerobics-friendly promotional clip, filmed in the early years of MTV, won a Grammy for best video.



Newton-John’s recent albums included ""Stronger Than Before,"" holiday collaboration with Travolta ""This Christmas,"" and the autobiographical ""Gaia: One Woman’s Journey,"" inspired by her battle with cancer and by the loss of her father.

Caregiver burnout is a significant concern, say health experts — and some states are now stepping up to offer online support to family members for free.

The New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA) and the Association on Aging in New York (AgingNY) recently announced a partnership with Trualta, a company that provides web-based educational skills training and a support platform.

The partnership supports those who are caring for their aging family members or friends at home.

The loved ones may suffer from conditions ranging from Alzheimer’s and dementia to developmental disabilities, stroke recovery, diabetes and more.

The platform also addresses caregiver wellness — and how to help a person transition from the hospital to home, a spokesperson for Trualta told Fox News Digital.

The initiative comes at no cost to residents of New York State who are providing unpaid care to a family member or friend, according to a news release from the New York State Office of the Aging.

New York joins five other states that are offering no-cost virtual help to individuals who are providing unpaid care to family members or friends in those states.

North Carolina, Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin and New Hampshire currently offer the online platform statewide to residents free of charge.

The Trualta program is also available free of charge in certain parts of 27 other states thanks to counties, state providers and community-based organizations, a spokesperson for the company told Fox News Digital.

There are efforts underway to make it available across all 50 states.

‘A big flip’

Caregiver Leda Rosenthal told Fox News Digital that she was 19 years old when her mother was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s disease at age 57.

""It was a big flip from being the one who was being taken care of to being the one who is taking care of my mom,"" said Rosenthal.

She described the difficult journey a person faces when taking on the caregiver role of a family member.

""Different challenges started popping up,"" she said.

She noted that her mom ""would wander. We have two big dogs, so she would get lost with them in the neighborhood.""

She also said her mom would leave the stove on by accident.

""Caregivers already feel socially isolated — and when the pandemic hit, this just made it hard to connect with others.""

Rosenthal told Fox News Digital the most taxing situation for her was the behavioral challenges in her mother that she experienced.

""My mom’s agitation, her anxiety — she started to have hallucinations as well,"" said Rosenthal.

MASSACHUSETTS MOM IS HONORED BY HER GROWN KIDS IN PICTURE-PERFECT PORTRAITS

She said she searched the web for hours at a time to try to find ways of successfully communicating with her mom.

""You get lots of misinformation online,"" she told Fox Digital News.

Aside from experiencing the behavioral issues of their loved ones, Rosenthal said there is the social isolation aspect of the work they do.

""Caregivers already feel socially isolated — and when the pandemic hit, this just made it hard to connect with others,"" she said.

Rosenthal decided to use her technology skills and personal situation to create a career path to help those who are aging remain at home, while also supporting those who care for them.

Caregivers can type in the scenario or symptom they're dealing with — and a selection of skills training information is offered.

She eventually met with Jonathan Davis, the CEO of Trualta, which is headquartered in St. Joseph, Missouri — and became the director of growth for the company.

Rosenthal described the website as offering a menu of options.

Instead of selecting a movie genre from a menu of movies, for example, caregivers can type in a scenario or symptom they might be dealing with — and a selection of skills training information will be offered.

You might say, for example, ""that your loved one is wandering,"" she said.

Then, you might be provided with ""steps to reduce wandering, broken up by different tasks,"" said Rosenthal in describing the specific tips offered.

While caregivers may not need to understand the science behind their loved one’s disease, they do need to learn coping skills in dealing with the challenges the disease creates for the person they're taking care of, said Rosenthal.

""What’s important as a caregiver is how you can respond to create a better experience for your loved one and for yourself to reduce your burnout.""

Caregivers, she said, ""don't know what skills go into agitation — but they know the problem that they are having.""

Rosenthal said that ""what’s important as a caregiver is how you can respond to create a better experience for your loved one and for yourself to reduce your burnout.""

CAREGIVER FATIGUE IN AMERICA IS RISING AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE: REPORTS

Joel Salinas, assistant professor of neurology in the Department of Neurology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told Fox News Digital, ""A diagnosis of dementia is not just a diagnosis for the patient — it’s also a diagnosis for the patient’s family and whoever else will be providing informal caregiving.""

He said as well, ""Caregiving can add a significant stress on the ability to participate in work and self-care — and there is also a great deal of uncertainty about so many aspects of care and what to expect. There are serious health and economic impacts from this kind of caregiving, so seeking support early and consistently can be critical.""

A Trualta spokesperson said the e-platform provides adult learners with the ability to scan and find answers quickly from evidence-based sourcing.

A study published in 2021 in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports found that 84.4% of participants who accessed the Trualta platform reported using skills they learned via the online platform.

The study also found that skills pertaining to behavioral management were reportedly used the most (60%) — while over half the caregivers reported allocating more time for self-care.

There are reportedly more than four million caregivers in New York State who provide nearly 2.7 billion hours of unpaid care.

Caregiver burden scores also appeared to decrease after people used Trualta for 30 days, according to the study.

The study's authors said in the peer-reviewed published report, ""This highlights the potential for online interventions to help informal caregivers access valuable techniques they can apply in their daily life.""

Rosenthal, commenting on that study, told Fox News Digital that ""when the caregivers are offered access to Trualta, in just 30 days we see the following: a 12% decrease in behavioral symptom severity, a 10% decrease in distress and a 30% improvement in caregiver fulfillment.""

A previous study also showed that when a family member is trained in caring for a loved one at home, that training may lead to reduced hospitalizations for the loved one.

Rosenthal said that when a family member receives training in prevention and in recognizing different signs and symptoms of conditions, for example — such as urinary tract infections — earlier treatment can be given.

Talk about pedaling with purpose!

The Pan-Massachusetts Challenge (PMC), a two-day charity bicycle ride across the Bay State, is on the cusp of contributing an incredible $1 billion to the fight against cancer ever since its inception in 1980.

The 2022 PMC hits the streets this weekend (Aug. 6-7) with thousands of amateur bicyclists pedaling across cities, down back country roads and past Cape Cod National Seashore to raise money for the Jimmy Fund at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

Organizers hope to raise and donate $66 million this weekend alone.

The PMC has donated $831 million to Dana-Farber since its founding 42 years ago. Organizers anticipate topping $1 billion in donations by 2024.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO FOUNDED THE STURGIS MOTORCYCLE RALLY, ‘PUT THE BROTHERHOOD IN MOTORCYCLES’

The PMC is a tribute to the power of the human spirit to take pain and turn it into progress.

Founder Billy Starr, a native of Newton, Mass., west of Boston, launched the event in 1980.

He pedaled across the commonwealth with 35 friends, after watching three relatives, including his mother, succumb to cancer in the 1970s.

Betty Starr was just 49 years old.

""The PMC was not a career plan,"" Starr told Fox News Digital. ""But it was something I needed to do. I saw an opportunity to do something good. It lit me up.""

Thousands of other cyclists are lit up as well by the event each year.

Many describe the charity ride as a spiritual experience: two days spinning past the New England countryside in the hot summer sun, at times pedaling in pain or on the verge of quitting, the whir of bicycle gears often the only sound with thousands of others united in common purpose.

""The PMC is the single largest contributor to Dana-Farber and the Jimmy Fund and is responsible for 55 percent of the Jimmy Fund’s annual revenue,"" the PMC proclaims on its website.

Every rider dollar raised goes to Dana-Farber. The event's entire operational budget is funded by corporate largesse.

The ride’s signature 212-mile route is a two-day ride from the hills of Sturbridge in Central Mass. to the sand dunes of Provincetown at the far tip of Cape Cod.

The PMC is supported by thousands of volunteers who do everything from make sandwiches at water stops to load rider luggage on trucks destined for Provincetown.

Countless thousands of Massachusetts residents and visitors line the road to cheer riders along the flagship route and the PMC's many secondary routes.

Starr and his team of 36 pedal partners raised a mere $10,000 in 1980.



But the original riders felt they had done something special. Many of those cyclists have returned each year since.

""Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong that year,"" said Starr. ""Yet everyone thought that it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.""

The ride has only grown since, which Starr pushing harder and demanding more from fundraisers and corporate sponsors each year.

Police are investigating Anne Heche for driving under the influence after she crashed her car into a home in Los Angeles on Friday.

The crash ignited a fire and almost destroyed the Mar Vista home.

Julia Jayne, founder of Jayne Law Group, P.C., explained to Fox News Digital that Heche would be charged in the crash, even if she wasn't under the influence.

""She's going to get charged,"" Jayne said. ""They're going to try to charge her with something for that. Reckless driving at a minimum, if she's got no alcohol in her system.""

Legal experts previously told Fox News Digital that Heche could be charged with reckless driving, hit-and-run and potentially DUI.

A public information officer for the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to Fox News Digital that authorities obtained a warrant for a sample of Heche's blood on Aug. 5.

The results of the blood test are pending and the investigation ongoing. If Heche is found to have been intoxicated during the crash, she will be charged with a DUI hit-and-run, LAPD told Fox News Digital. Authorities will then present the case to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office.

If drugs are detected in the LAPD's initial toxicology screen, authorities will have to run a confirmatory test to decide what level of drug was in Heche's system. This secondary toxicology report could take up to 30 days, according to a representative for the Los Angeles Police Department.

Jayne, a criminal defense attorney, told Fox News Digital that police taking time to investigate driving under the influence isn't ""unique"" to Heche's crash.

""If there's time, send it to the lab,"" she said. ""Get the blood test results, because also there are certain enhancements that they might want to charge depending on what the blood alcohol level is. So, it makes sense that they would do that investigation, not unique to her in any DUI case.""

Jayne explained that if the blood sample was taken within three hours of Heche's crash, the blood sample would be considered ""reliable for the time of driving.""

""They probably took it within that time, and that gives them some confidence,"" she said.

The ""Donnie Brasco"" actress is in ""extreme critical condition"" after the crash, a representative for the actress told Fox News Digital on Monday.

""She has a significant pulmonary injury requiring mechanical ventilation and burns that require surgical intervention,"" the rep said. ""She is in a coma and has not regained consciousness since shortly after the accident.""

Heche's rep shared on Saturday that she was in ""stable condition,"" noting that the actress' ""family and friends ask for your thoughts and prayers and to respect her privacy during this difficult time.""

Heche's ex-boyfriend, Thomas Jane, previously told the Daily Mail that the actress is ""expected to pull through.""

The actress crashed her Mini Cooper twice on Friday, with the second crash igniting a fire that left a home almost destroyed in the Mar Vista neighborhood.

Heche suffered burn injuries but was ""conscious and breathing"" when paramedics removed her from the vehicle.

It's unclear when the results of her toxicology report will be returned to authorities.

LeBron James aims to give students at his I Promise School opportunities they may not have otherwise.

Recently, the NBA superstar's mission shifted into another gear.

James Bromsey III, a sixth-grader at James' school in Akron, Ohio, was given behind-the-scenes access before NASCAR’s race Sunday at Michigan International Speedway.

It was a fitting way to celebrate a student, whose father died four years ago. James Bromsey II shared a dream with family and friends that his son would be in the Akron Soap Box Derby, an event that dates to 1934.

""My son was six months old when his dad said he was going to be in the soap box derby,"" Tomika Pope recalled.

Bromsey fulfilled a promise to participate in the event in June. He was awarded a VIP experience by Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing, which put a paint job on Chris Buescher's No. 17 Ford to include logos, colors and words associated with the LeBron James Family Foundation.

Bromsey rode in a pace car, climbed up the spotter's stand and had a meet-and-greet session with Buescher.

""When did you do your first flip? he asked Buescher, who said he had not flipped, but did recently have his car catch on fire. Buescher went on to tell his guests that his dad got him started in racing.

""Dad was into racing, too,"" Bromsey said quietly.

During a tour of RFK's hauler, which included a peek through an overhead opening at the space where the team stores its two cars, Bromsey's aunt Tracy Gholston was almost brought to tears. Gholston said her brother died in 2018, shortly after a bout with pneumonia.

""He could have led this tour,"" she said, choking up. ""It’s so emotional to see how God put this all together.""

Bromsey added: ""He would be telling you everything about all the cars.""

Bromsey also was given access to the garage area, where he posed for pictures and pointed toward the I Promise School logo on Buescher's car. He later walked behind the Mustang as it was pushed to the track and watched as Buescher finished 16th in the 37-car race won by Kevin Harvick in the No. 4 Ford.

James is a minority owner in Fenway Sports Group, a parent company of RFK Racing. He opened the I Promise School, which is at full capacity with third to eighth-graders, four years ago in a partnership with his family foundation and Akron City Schools, aiming to support kids facing the same problems he had during a challenging childhood.

Before the race, James wished Buescher luck on Twitter and celebrated Bromsey's experience.

""For James to have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity at the track is amazing,"" James said. ""He’s an incredible kid with a love for racing. We wanted to show him that anything is possible when you go out and chase your dreams. And with the No. 17 car representing all of us, we want all the kids from Akron to know that nothing is out of reach for them.""

Did a day at the track inspire Bromsey to someday become a NASCAR driver?

The 6-foot-7 lineman, who was rumored to have hit 400 pounds last season, was run-blocking at right tackle on the second play of team drills when he went down on the grass and immediately grabbed at his knee.

Becton was down for a few moments before trying to get up and needed assistance from trainers to walk off the field.

Saleh, anticipating the media and fan storm that would soon follow, defended Becton and his work ethic.

Getting a personal loan can be difficult if you have a limited credit history or bad credit. Some lenders that target bad credit borrowers promise no credit check and fast funding. But these loans often come with expensive fees that can trap you in a cycle of debt.

If you’re struggling to choose the right personal loan — or finding it flat-out impossible — you may start to feel discouraged. Before you settle for an expensive loan product, though, here are some bad credit loans that you should avoid — whether you just need a few hundred dollars, want a $10,000 loan , or anything in between.



Credible makes it easy to see your prequalified personal loan rates from various lenders, all in one place.

1. Payday loans

A payday loan is a small, short-term loan intended to tide you over with an advance until your next payday. Storefront payday lenders typically offer these loans, but you may also find them online. Depending on your state, there may also be a maximum borrowing limit, often $500 or less. Lenders usually require borrowers to repay these loans in two to four weeks’ time, in one lump sum, plus fees.

If you’re struggling to make ends meet before your paycheck hits, this can seem like an enticing loan option, especially if you need same-day funds .

Why you should avoid them: Most payday loan lenders don’t have strict credit- or income-based qualifications, so they often loan money to people who may struggle to repay the debt . Additionally, these loans are notoriously expensive. While most states cap the interest that can be charged per $100 borrowed, this is usually in the range of $10 to $30.

While that may not sound like too much, when you consider the length of the loan term and the low borrowing limits, these fees work out to an astronomical APR. For example, a $100 payday loan with a two-week repayment term and a $15 fee equates to an APR of nearly 400%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

Compare that to the average interest rate on a 24-month personal loan — 8.73% in May 2022, according to the Federal Reserve — and it’s easy to see what a ""deal"" payday loans really work out to be.

2. Cash advance loans

A cash advance loan is similar to a payday loan, in that you can use its short-term funds to help you cover immediate or unexpected expenses. These loans can even be funded as quickly as the same day, depending on the lender.

Cash advance loans differ from payday loans in some important ways, though. For starters, you can usually borrow a lot more with a cash advance loan, with some lenders offering as much as $5,000. You don’t always have to repay a cash advance loan in just a few weeks, either; you may be able to take out a cash advance that you can repay in monthly installments.

Why you should avoid them: Cash advance loans are still significantly more expensive than traditional personal loans, or even credit cards. Depending on the lender, your cash advance loan could have an APR of 299% or more.

3. Car title loans

If you have bad credit and need to borrow money, using your vehicle as collateral to get a car title loan could be one option. But car title loans aren’t a good choice for most borrowers.

Title loans often have repayment terms as short as 30 days, though you might find installment options as long as 24 months. The amount you can borrow depends on your location, as well as the value of your vehicle — as long as you own your vehicle free and clear.

Why you should avoid them: The downside? You probably already guessed it: You’ll pay significantly more in interest with a title loan than with a traditional personal loan. It’s not uncommon for car title loans to have APRs in the triple digits.

More than that, though, you’re securing the loan with one of your most important assets: your car. If you were to default on your title loan, the lender could take ownership of your vehicle.

4. Pawn shop loans

A pawn shop loan is a short-term loan that’s secured by something you own, such as jewelry or other valuables. These loans typically allow you to access money quickly, depending on how much your valuables are worth.

Pawn shop lenders typically don’t run a credit check, so these loans can seem like a good option for borrowers with poor credit or those looking for a no-credit-check loan . The pawn shop will usually offer a percentage of the pawned item’s value in loan form. You’ll need to repay the loan by an agreed-upon date, or the shop keeps the item.

Why you should avoid them: If you repay the loan as agreed, you can get your valuables back. But your pawn shop loan will have accrued interest in the interim, which you’ll also need to pay. These loans also tend to have a variety of fees tacked on, such as storage, setup, and even appraisal fees. For this reason, a lower interest rate can be deceptive, as the loan will actually end up costing you considerably more in the end.

Try a personal loan instead

If you need funds for an unexpected expense, large purchase, or even to refinance high-interest debt, a traditional personal loan is often your best bet — even if you have bad credit. Here are some things you can do to increase your chances of qualifying for one:

Apply with a cosigner. Adding a cosigner with good credit to your personal loan application may be the answer to getting approved or snagging better interest rates. Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit.

Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit. Check your credit reports. If your low credit score is keeping you from getting a personal loan, it’s important to understand why. Check your credit reports to see what sort of negative items are bringing down your score. In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected.

In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected. Consider a secured personal loan. A secured loan uses one or more of your assets as collateral for the debt. Because of this added protection, lenders often have lower credit score requirements for secured loans and may even approve borrowers with a bad credit score. Some financial institutions might not even require a minimum credit score at all, as long as you’re securing the loan with an asset. But keep in mind that if you fall behind on your loan payments, the lender can take your collateral."

WHAT IS CASH-OUT REFINANCING AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

How mortgage rates have changed over time

Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac — 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates.

If you’re ready to take advantage of current mortgage refinance rates that are below average historical lows, you can use Credible to check rates from multiple lenders .

How to get your lowest mortgage refinance rate

If you’re interested in refinancing your mortgage, improving your credit score and paying down any other debt could secure you a lower rate . It’s also a good idea to compare rates from different lenders if you're hoping to refinance so you can find the best rate for your situation.

Borrowers can save $1,500 on average over the life of their loan by shopping for just one additional rate quote, and an average of $3,000 by comparing five rate quotes, according to research from Freddie Mac .

Be sure to shop around and compare current mortgage rates from multiple mortgage lenders if you decide to refinance your mortgage. You can do this easily with Credible's free online tool and see your prequalified rates in only three minutes.

How does Credible calculate refinance rates?

The rates assume a borrower has a 740 credit score and is borrowing a conventional loan for a single-family home that will be their primary residence. The rates also assume no (or very low) discount points and a down payment of 20%.

When is it worth it to refinance?

Refinancing a mortgage can be a great way to save money. But it’s not always the best move for every homeowner.

People refinance for a number of reasons, including to get a lower interest rate, change their monthly payment amount and lower their interest costs. Generally, if you can lower your interest rate by at least 0.75%, refinancing might be a good move.

But before you refinance, be sure to weigh closing costs, and calculate how long it will take before your savings from the refinance cover the expenses of refinancing.

What is a good mortgage rate?

Generally, a good mortgage rate is one that’s the lowest you can qualify for based on your individual factors, such as credit history, income, other debts, down payment amount, and more.

A rate that’s good for your financial situation should result in a monthly mortgage payment that you can manage, while leaving plenty of room in your monthly budget to put toward savings, investments, and an emergency fund. And a good rate should be competitive with average rates in the geographic area where you’re looking to buy.

PRIVACY TIP: 5 WAYS YOU'RE BEING TRACKED YOU MUST STOP RIGHT NOW

Start with the outside

Keeping your phone clean isn’t hard with the right supplies and a little bit of elbow grease. Set down the paper towels and follow these simple steps for cleaning your screen, ports, and case.

Cleaning the screen

First, remove your phone’s case and accessories. You want to reach every nook and cranny.

A microfiber cloth works for wiping away smudges and grease, but I prefer screen cleaning wipes designed for smartphones. They’re just so easy. Skip paper towels. They’re too rough for delicate jobs like this.

I have purchased this 210-pack of screen cleaning wipes from Care Touch time and time again. Use them on smartphones, tablets, monitors, TVs, and remote controls. They’re scratch-free and made with anti-static tissue that cleans without leaving behind streaks or lint.

Don’t forget the ports

Your phone's ports collect dust, grime, and dirt. Avoid using cotton swabs, which leave behind fuzz and could leave you worse off than when you started. Toothpicks can work if you are very gentle, but breaking off the sharp end inside a port is easy.

I prefer tools made for the job. It helps that these are cheap.

This Skylety 17-piece phone cleaning kit is under $10. The kit includes anti-static brushes, nylon brushes, cleaning cloths and a de-dusting film. You can use them to clear the gunk out of your ports gently.

Scrub your case

If you keep your phone in a case, I bet you’re shocked every time you take it off and see all the grime collected inside it. You don’t need to be quite as careful with your case as your phone's screen and ports.

For plastic, rubber, and silicone cases, grab an old toothbrush and a bit of warm, soapy water. Use the toothbrush to reach all the corners and crevices. Rinse it thoroughly.

Very lightly dampen a microfiber cloth with water and a mild soap for leather cases. Lightly rub the case in circular motions.

After it’s clean, let your case dry thoroughly before you put it back on. Need case recommendations? I share some here, along with my favorite screen protector . This has saved me from cracking my iPhone several times.

Now that your phone is bright and shiny on the outside, let's dive into the inside.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there's been an increased focus on mental health, especially among young people. 1 out of every 6 children age 6 to 17 experience a mental health disorder every year, and now a new investment company wants to use technology to make them easier to treat. Telosity by Vinaj Ventures is a fund set up back in 2019 specifically to invest in companies that provide tech-based solutions to improve mental well-being among young people, a demographic used to doing pretty much everything on their phones or computers. The founder and CEO, Anish Srivastava, says he was inspired to start the fund when he saw how few mental health resources were available, especially for kids and teens. ""Accessibility is very difficult,"" according to Srivastava, ""and what tech does is it helps democratize access to care.""

And if Telosity is successful, in the near future, kids and teens might be meeting their mental health counselors in cyberspace, which the company wants to use as a jumping off point to meet young people in the space where they're most comfortable. ""We can use that as a place for resources,"", says Srivastava, ""whether its educational types of capabilities, self learning mental health, being able to provide tele-therapy solutions, et cetera.""

And it's not just scheduling apps and telemedicine; new advancements in virtual reality could make it much easier for doctors to examine - and also treat patients - in an online setting. Telosity has been seeing a growing market interest in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), and much of it focuses on mental health assessment tools for providers. All that could make it even easier for kids and teens to access mental health resources, since they don't even have to leave their homes in many cases.

It's also good news for businesses. Telosity released a report last month showing youth mental health solutions will be a $26,000,000,000 market by 2027, and the company calls that an unprecedented opportunity for businesses to beef up their bottom line, while also providing help to millions of the most vulnerable Americans. Srivasta says that could be a major selling point for investors in the mental health space. ""There's an opportunity to do good while investing and building sustainable businesses, and I think that's the driver for tech.""

The key to retrieving text messages

Your best bet for retrieving deleted messages is accessing an older backup of your phone. You can do that through iCloud for your iPhone.

The same is true for your streaming devices and services. Tap or click to limit tracking through Netflix, Amazon, Roku, Hulu and more.

With your privacy bases covered, consider your health. Here are a few tips to minimize eye strain, neck strain and eye fatigue.

1. Lighting matters

""You're going to ruin your eyes!"" We all heard that as kids sitting in front of the TV, right? Watching TV probably won't cause lasting vision damage, but it might strain your eyes.

A mellow, dimly-lit room is the best way to watch TV. Open windows, glaring track lights, and other distracting illumination sources make your eyes work overtime.

You don’t need a bunch of fancy smart lighting or gadgets, either. Draw the blinds, turn off the house lights, and stick to incandescent over LEDs if you prefer not to go full-on black-out mode.

Lamps and other lights can cause annoying reflections and glare. Choose ambient light sources muffled by diffusive domes or lampshades.

Get your money’s worth: 5 things you didn’t know your smart TV could do

2. Smart formula to know if you’re too close

When it comes to eye health, you should sit far enough from the TV so your eyes won't be exposed to excessive glare.

The secret formula: Measure the width of your TV and multiply that number by five. This distance is the ballpark you should shoot for in your home theater, living room, or any other spot you have a TV. Now, it’s harder to stick to this formula with larger TVs.

The size of the room, the shape and number of seats you have to configure, and other factors like window placement also come into play. Some give or take is fine. Aim for at least about 10 feet away if you can.

3. Check your screen height

A TV installed too high or low can cause eye and neck strain. The most comfortable viewing experience is with the TV around eye level when you’re sitting. So, how do you set it up? Use a laser pointer or a long measuring tape to find your direct line of sight from the best seat in the house.

Have a friend or family member lightly mark the spot on the wall with a pencil. If you’re working alone, do your best to remember where the marker hit during the experiment. The center of your TV screen should sit about where you marked.

3 ways to find out if your smart TV was hacked (and how to protect it)

4. Turn down the brightness

Bright, concentrated blue light is harsh on your eyes. That’s why staring at your phone in a dark room can feel so jarring.

Is your TV backlit? An OLED? What HDR capabilities does it bring to the table? All this impacts what brightness is best. Your eyes will also give you lots of clues. Do you find yourself squinting when the room is dark? The TV is probably too bright.

Check your TV's user manual or click the settings menu to find the brightness. Don't just rely on one of the pre-sets. Tune up and down and see what's best for your space.

Take some time to play with color temperature, HDR settings, and image saturation, too.

Decades after they starved, beat and tortured the boy – caging him in a slatted wooden box the size of a coffin – an underage World War II veteran refused to speak about his former enemies with hatred. His story holds lessons about reconciliation for a nation battered by today’s culture wars.

Joseph Johnson was only 14 when he enlisted in the U.S. Army, a year before Pearl Harbor. He’d fled a difficult home life in Memphis, fibbed about his age to a recruiter, and managed to get lost in the shuffle. He was sent to Manila with the 31st Infantry Division, having no clue of the impending horror.

On Dec. 7, 1941, 10 hours after attacking Hawaii, Japan hit the Philippines. The largely under prepared U.S. and Filipino troops were plunged into battle. The boy fought bravely, loading machine guns and ferrying messages between headquarters and front lines. Once, to escape a sniper’s attack, he leaped into an empty foxhole, only to land on an enemy soldier crouching in the dirt. The boy fought for his life, subduing his opponent with his bare hands.

Joe had met an orphaned teenage girl back at a brothel in Manila, and they became unlikely friends who helped each other endure. When she’d become pregnant from her unfortunate job, Joe helped her seek sanctuary in a church. He paid the nuns for the girl’s room and board.

LAST REMAINING WORLD WAR II MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT TO LIE IN HONOR AT US CAPITOL

The memory of her friendship helped sustain the boy in the fight on Corregidor, where Joe and his fellow soldiers made their last stand. The allied troops were outgunned and outmanned, plagued with tropical diseases, and cut off from resupply. As their foodstuffs slowly diminished, they ate monkeys found in the jungle.

Finally, in May 1942, Gen. Jonathan Wainwright formally surrendered all allied troops in the Philippines. Joe laid down his arms and became a prisoner of war. He was 16.

At the brutal Nichols Field detail, Joe and fellow POWs were forced to extend an airstrip. It was backbreaking work with a pick and shovel in the broiling sun.

Joe suffered from a raft of tropical diseases, including pellagra, dry beriberi, scurvy and malaria. After being savagely beaten for a small rule infraction, Joe knew he wouldn’t survive Nichols Field. Feigning insanity, he sliced his arms with a sharpened spoon and smeared blood on his face, hoping the guards would send him to Bilibid Prison, where a few American doctors still practiced.

That’s when he spent a week locked in a cage. Naked, bloodied, prodded through the slats by his captors, the boy was given no food or drink. Rainwater kept him alive. Finally, he was tossed on the back of a truck and driven to Bilibid, where he slowly regained his health. His audacious plan had worked.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, AUGUST 2, 1943, JFK SAVES PT-109 CREW AFTER COLLISION WITH JAPANESE DESTROYER

But his horrors weren’t over. In October 1944, Joe and 1,600 POWs were loaded onto a ship to work in Japan’s mines. By the time they reached port six weeks later, only 450 POWs were still alive. Suffering malnutrition and a grisly leg injury, Joe was held at the Fukuoka POW camp until Japan’s surrender in August 1945. At last, he came home to freedom. Joe was 19 years old and had grown to 6 feet, 4 inches. He weighed only 109 pounds.

Post-war, Joe struggled with severe PTSD. Counseling, family and faith helped. He learned the wisdom of forgiveness, as recorded in his journal: ""Life is too short to hold on to hurt. Whether you’re hurt from being abused as a POW or from your daddy leaving when you were young, you got to set that hurt down. You’ll only hurt yourself when you harbor hate.""

In his senior years, Joe became active in veteran causes, using his scars to help people heal. He became a rebuilder of lives, a restorer of spirits. Whenever he spoke about the past, he never used the derogatory word for his former captors, always speaking about them with respect.

For America today, embroiled in culture wars and divided by hostilities, a nod to Joe Johnson may well be part of the solution to rebuilding the country. Each person holds an individual responsibility to promote peace. More understanding is the answer, more finding common ground, more forgiveness.

Less hate."

January 24, 2006, our family went from watching the nightly news to being the news story, that day, my niece Jennifer Kesse was abducted in Orlando, Fla. and our lives changed forever.

On the morning of Jan. 24 Jenn failed to report to her job as a finance manager at a well-known timeshare company. She was 24 years old. She was last heard from at around 10 p.m. the night before when she spoke by phone with her family and boyfriend from inside her condominium.

In the weeks following Jenn’s abduction, during the day, our family and friends were busy doing everything we could to raise awareness and handing out missing person flyers at major road intersections, posting them in businesses, and going door to door in the neighborhoods near Jenn’s condo. We were encouraged daily by people who came to help a family in need, a family they didn’t know.

Most nights, I was exhausted physically and emotionally, lying in bed trying to fall asleep, but my mind would not turn off. Thoughts bounced from trying to make sense of what happened to Jennifer to my marriage, business, and kids. Those nights were filled with tears, as my emotions were on hyperdrive, trying to process everything that was happening.

JENNIFER KESSE DISAPPEARANCE: POLICE PHOTOS SUGGEST VIOLENT STRUGGLE

Those restless nights felt more like a wrestling match with my past while being confronted with the brutal facts of my present reality. Facing reality is painful, but I would learn that it is also beneficial, restorative, and transformative if embraced.

I began crying out to God, which in itself is puzzling since I had walked away from church when I was 14 years old. It has been said that pain is God’s megaphone, and it turns out to be true. He now had my undivided attention. I was approaching my 50th birthday in May 2006 and facing the most desperate and challenging crisis in my life with nowhere to go and no one to turn to but God.

I bared my heart and soul to Him, just like I would with my best friends. For the first time in my life, I acknowledged how out of control my life was while feeling powerless to fix the mess I had created. I was forced to confront the truth about my life in a different way, in a way I would never have chosen.

Every night I prayed desperately for Jennifer to be brought home safely, to have the life she deserved. In those moments, I asked God to take my life so that Jenn could have hers back.

I had hit rock bottom. One night, I remember experiencing a sense of peace during my conversations with God that defied my current circumstances. It felt odd, bizarre. How could this be? How do I have peace when everything in and around me is in turmoil? What did this all mean?

ROBERT JEFFRESS: DON’T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF PRAYER, NO MATTER WHAT OTHERS SAY

Pain is indeed a megaphone. I opened my heart to hear what God was saying and embraced a new life He offered. By His grace, I was inspired to write a book, ""Aftermath of Jennifer Kesse’s Abduction: An Uncle’s Inspiring Journey and Other Stories of Hope.""

In the book, I share my 16-year journey of life transformation, from selfish to selfless, authentically and vulnerably, and introduce readers to inspirational stories of people who overcame unimaginable obstacles.

Inspired hope is not wishful thinking but a confident expectation only found in one person through an intimate relationship that lasts our lifetime. This hope is anchored to a person and a promise - the person of Jesus and the promise - that if you believe in Jesus, you will have life; an authentic and meaningful life resulting from being rescued, redeemed, and restored to a right relationship with God that will positively impact all the relationships in your life.

I need that confident hope and thankfully God gave the strength and patience to persevere over the past 16 plus years. I knew I wasn’t the person I wanted to be, nor was I the husband and father my family deserved.

The road I traveled included some rocky paths, some slippery slopes, and some uncomfortable terrain that was my life and relationships at that time. As I pursued my new life and preferred future, some of the people in my life may not be happy, it made them uncomfortable. Some believed it was my latest fad. Over time it became obvious it was not.

Thankfully, my wife and family never gave up on me, and most people in my life encouraged and cheer me on to finish strong.

If you would like to change the narrative direction of your life, I found the best place to start is with ourselves. Having focused on becoming the person I wished other people were, I was transformed into a better version of myself, and honestly, I cringe thinking about my old self. Know that I will be cheering you on so that you finish strong!

I do have one request -- that you keep my sister Joyce, my brother-in-law, Drew, and my nephew Logan and his family in your prayers because as of the date of this writing, Jennifer is still missing, vanished without a trace.

One of my objectives for writing this book is that the person or people who were involved in Jennifer’s abduction would know that no matter what they have done, the final chapter of their life stories has not been written. They can come forward with information that will either bring Jenn home or bring closure to our family. Facing the truth does, in fact, set you free, and a new life is waiting to begin.

The head of the Anglican Communion attempted to reinforce the church's stance against homosexual marriage this week, but the move was squashed by outcry from various bishops.

The controversy came to a head during the ongoing 2022 Lambeth Conference — a rare meeting of Anglican Communion bishops from around the world.

The Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches (GSFA) — self-described as ""a worldwide fellowship of orthodox Anglican Provinces and Dioceses within the Anglican Communion"" — came to the conference with the gay marriage ban firmly on their agenda.

""We often feel that our voices are not listened to, or respected,"" South Sudanese Primate Rev. Justin Badi told The Church Times. ""Today, in Canterbury, we may be ‘gathered together’, but we most certainly cannot ‘walk together’ until Provinces which have gone against scripture — and the will of the consensus of the bishops — repent and return to orthodoxy.""

QUEEN ELIZABETH SNUBS PRINCE HARRY, PRAISES PRINCES CHARLES, WILLIAM FOR HONORING PRINCE PHILLIP'S CLIMATE WORK

He continued, ""The Communion is not in a healthy condition at present, and only major surgery will put that right.""

They were bolstered in private, if not publicly, by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. The archbishop, by the nature of his office, is the most senior cleric in the Anglican Communion but holds limited powers of governance on his own.

POPE FRANCIS WARNS GERMAN BISHOPS: CHANGING TEACHINGS IS 'NOT LAWFUL,' CAUSES CHURCHES TO 'ROT AND DIE'

Welby met with the GSFA in private on July 29 and offered to write a letter backing the traditional view of marriage, according to Anglican Church journalist George Conger. A call was scheduled for the conference — a sort of vote amongst the bishops to endorse or abandon proposed belief statements.

The next day — after word got out about the push for a formal rejection of homosexual marriage — the conference was threatened with chaos.

Many bishops reportedly stayed seated and did not receive the Eucharist during the mass. Protests against recording votes on church calls arose, and eventually, the conference ceased keeping track of individual bishops' decisions.

The call to reinforce Lambeth 1.10 was eventually dropped.

However, there was no demonstration against the archbishop nor the conference, and proceedings continued.

Despite the fervor, Welby made good on his promised letter, released to the faithful on Tuesday.

""I wanted to write this letter to you now so that I can clarify two matters for all of us. Given the deep differences that exist within the Communion over same-sex marriage and human sexuality, I thought it important to set down what is the case,"" Welby wrote in his letter.

REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM AND THE BILLY GRAHAM EVANGELISTIC ASSOCIATION SHOW CHRISTIANS' STRUGGLES IN UKRAINE AMID WAR

He continued, ""I write therefore to affirm that the validity of the resolution passed at the Lambeth Conference 1998, 1:10 is not in doubt and that whole resolution is still in existence. Indeed the Call on Human Dignity made clear this is the case, as the resolution is quoted from three times in the paragraph 2.3 of the Call on Human Dignity.""

The archbishop went on to point out that the 1998 statues cited did not make mention of sanctions or exclusions based on obedience. Welby said that the ""Pain, anxiety, and contention"" caused by Lambeth 1.10 was ""very clear.""

He concluded, ""To be reconciled to one another across such divides is not something we can achieve by ourselves. That is why, as we continue to reflect on 1 Peter, I pray that we turn our gaze towards Christ who alone has the power to reconcile us to God and to one another.""

Anglicanism has been fracturing for decades over gay relationships, women's ordination and other issues. Those rifts blew wide open in 2003 when the New York-based Episcopal Church consecrated the first openly gay bishop, Gene Robinson, in New Hampshire.

The year prior, the top U.S. Episcopal legislative body, or General Convention, voted to authorize gay marriages in their churches.

Jury deliberations in the New Hampshire trial of a truck driver charged with killing seven motorcyclists began Tuesday after closing statements raised questions about who was more ""all over the place"": the trucker accused of swerving back and forth across the road or the eyewitnesses accused of contradicting each other.

Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, 26, of West Springfield, Massachusetts, faces negligent homicide, manslaughter and reckless conduct charges in connection with the June 21, 2019, crash that killed seven members of a Marine motorcycle club.

MASSACHUSETTS TRUCK DRIVER WHOSE CRASH KILLED 7 MOTORCYCLISTS APPEARS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TRIAL

Prosecutors have argued that Zhukovskyy, who had taken heroin, fentanyl and cocaine that day, repeatedly swerved back and forth before the head-on crash and told police he caused it. But a judge dismissed eight charges related to whether he was impaired, and his attorneys blame the lead biker, Albert ""Woody"" Mazza, who was among those killed.

""He was drunk, he was not looking where he was going, he lost control of his motorcycle and slid in front of Vlad Zhukovskyy’s truck. Al Mazza caused this accident. Vlad Zhukovskyy is not guilty,"" defense attorney Jay Duguay said in closing statements.

""There is no doubt that this accident was a tragedy,"" Duguay said. ""But we are not here to decide whether or not this was a tragedy.""

Duguay accused prosecutors of ignoring that their own accident reconstruction unit contradicted their theory that Zhukovskyy crossed into the oncoming lane. An expert hired by the defense, meanwhile, testified that the crash happened on the center line of the road and would have occurred even if the truck was in the middle of its lane because Mazza’s motorcycle was heading in that direction.

""From the beginning of this investigation, the state had made up their mind about what had happened, evidence be damned,"" said Duguay, who also highlighted inconsistencies between witness accounts or when witnesses contradicted themselves.

TRUCK DRIVER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE CRASH THAT KILLED 7 BIKERS WAS ON DRUGS, REPORT SAYS

""Those witnesses were all over the place about what they recalled and what they claimed to have seen,"" he said.

In particular, Duguay suggested that members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club ""shaded"" their accounts to protect Mazza and the club. Prosecutor Scott Chase acknowledged some inconsistencies but asked jurors to remember the circumstances.

""People were covering the dead, trying to save the barely living, comforting the dying. This wasn’t story time,"" he said. ""They were up here talking about some of the most unimaginable chaos, trauma, death and carnage that we can even imagine three years later. They were talking about hell broke open.""

Witnesses were consistent, he argued, in describing the truck as weaving back and forth before the crash. That behavior continued ""until he killed people,"" Chase said.

""That’s what stopped him. It’s not that he made some responsible decision to start paying attention or do the right thing,"" he said. ""The only thing that stopped him was an embankment after he tore through a group of motorcycles.""

Chase called the attempt to blame Mazza a ""fanciful story"" and ""frivolous distraction,"" while reminding jurors that Zhukovskyy, who didn’t testify at trial, told investigators, ""Obviously, I caused the crash.""

""He was crystal clear from the very beginning that he caused this crash,"" Chase said. ""That is what he said because that is what happened.""

The motorcyclists who died were from New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island and ranged in age from 42 to 62. They were part of a larger group that had just left a motel along U.S. Route 2 in Randolph.

A Missouri man has been charged with shooting and killing his neighbor following an argument over lawn mowing, bringing to an end years of hostility between the two, officials said.

Samuel Avery, 42, of Kansas City, was charged Monday with second-degree murder and armed criminal action in the killing of 41-year-old Warner Trotter, who was shot in his head on his front porch, the Jackson County Prosecutor's office said. Trotter was declared dead at hospital.

According to court documents, Avery called police on Sunday to report that he had shot his neighbor. Officers found Avery on his porch next door and arrested him without incident.

Online court records do not list an attorney who can speak for Avery.

Police said officers had been called to the men's homes twice previously because they were arguing over Avery mowing his lawn too early in the day. No one was arrested during those incidents. According to a probable cause statement, Avery told investigators they had been arguing for 10 years.

On the day of the shooting, Trotter complained that Avery's lawn mower was too loud and made a gesture with his hand that he would shoot Avery, according to court documents. Avery said he called the police and was told nothing could be done, then Trotter waved an actual gun around and said nothing would happen to him.

Hours later, Trotter and a woman returned to the home with food from a restaurant. The woman told police she was inside the house when she heard Trotter ask Avery something like, ""Do you have something to say?""

Then she heard several shots.

Avery told police that Trotter reached for a gun before Avery started firing his weapon, according to records.

Footage from security cameras at Trotter's home show him saying something to Avery then starting to enter the house when Avery fired at Trotter several times, according to the statement.

The video clearly shows Trotter did not reach for his weapon at any time, according to the probable cause statement. It also said first responding officers removed a weapon from Trotter’s waistband before emergency responders began treating him.

Kellogg's cereal company is the largest cereal distributor in the United States with its origins dating back to the late 19th century.

Corn flakes were Kellogg's company's first product that made them the king of cereal and a huge player in the American breakfast market. Will and John Kellogg created the product together in order to create a digestible yet affordable breakfast meal for middle Americans. During this period, many Americans had digestible issues due to the limited number of dietary options for middle-class Americans.

Together the Kellogg brothers promoted their new product as a ""nutritious and healthful"" breakfast option, but a disagreement over whether a small detail led to them splitting apart and the creation of the Kellogg cereal company.

Why was Corn Flakes invented?

John Kellogg, and his brother, Will, invented corn flakes for patients at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in 1894. The patients enjoyed the cereal, and two years later, a patent for the recipe was granted in 1896. The two brothers eventually went their separate ways after disagreeing over whether to add sugar to the cereal.

By the 20th century, Kellogg's Cereal Company cereal was marketed for its daily health benefits and as an easily digestible meal. They also emphasize the sweet flavor of the flakes and their ""dainty crispness."" During this time, indigestion was a big concern for Americans with sensitive stomachs, especially because morning dining options were limited.

Moreover, the cereal was also invented to align with the dietary restrictions of the Seventh Day Adventist church attended by the Kellogg family.

Are corn flakes good for you?

Corn flakes were created as a healthy and easily digestible cereal that would appeal to a broad demographic of Americans. However, corn flakes like any other cereal are low in fiber even when eaten with low-fat milk, so they are not the healthiest option for a balanced breakfast. If you do eat cornflakes the healthiest option would be to combine them with a piece of fruit or snack.

What is in corn flakes?

Kellogg's is suitable for vegans due to the ingredients that make up the golden flakes which are sugar, salt, barley malt extract, and vitamin E. Approximately 90% of the context is made out of corn.

A major point of disagreement between the Kellogg brothers was over the inclusion of sugar in the product because John did not want any traces of sugar in corn flakes while his brother Will believed it would attract more customers."

An 80-year-old Washington state woman was permanently banned from her local YMCA pool after demanding that a transgender employee leave the women’s locker room, she told local media.

""I saw a man in a woman’s bathing suit watching maybe four or five little girls pulling down their suits in order to use the toilet,"" Port Townsend resident Julie Jaman recalled of the July incident to Seattle radio show host Dori Monson on Friday. ""I asked if he had a penis and he said it was none of my business. I told that man to ‘get out right now.’""

The incident occurred on July 26 at the Mountain View pool, which is a City of Port Townsend facility operated by the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, according to local news outlet Port Townsend Free Press.

Jaman said that she was alerted to the trans employee being in the women’s locker room while she was showering and ""heard a man’s voice.""

She told Monson that she alerted a pool staffer to the incident and was stunned when the staff member told her she was ""being discriminatory,"" and ""was banned from the pool forever."" The staffer also allegedly said the police would be called, according to Jaman’s radio interview.

""She didn’t ask me what the problem was, if I was okay, nothing about me,"" Jaman told Monson. ""It’s as if she was just waiting to pounce on me. It was just stunning.""

The Port Townsend Police Department told Fox News Digital that no official police report was filed, but the department provided an incident report on the matter.

The incident report details that Jaman ""had an emotional response to a strange male being in the bathroom"" near young girls, and is hoping to not be ""trespassed"" from the pool, according to a phone call an officer had with Jaman. The report also noted a phone call from the YMCA detailing that Jaman was reportedly in the facility’s locker room ""screaming"" at an employee and ""refusing to leave.""

Erin Hawkins, the marketing & communications manager for the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, told Fox News Digital that the permanent pool ban followed a build-up of incidents where Jaman violated the facility’s code of conduct. She said the permanent suspension was not solely due to the singular incident in the women's locker room last month.

""Julie Jaman was permanently suspended from the Mountain View Pool due to her repeatedly violating our Code of Conduct, specifically, using disrespectful words or gestures toward YMCA staff or others; abusive, harassing and/or obscene language or gestures toward YMCA staff or others,"" Hawkins said in comment to Fox News Digital on Monday.

Jaman told local media that she had been a member of the pool facility for 35 years and has lived in Port Townsend for about 40 years. She has voted for Democrats during her life, she told the local outlet, and considers herself an ""XX woman,"" referring to her chromosomes.

She added to the Port Townsend Free Press that she recoiled at being naked and showering in a room with a person born male. She added that the ""momma bear in me"" came out when she saw the individual near the young girls in the bathroom.

Jaman added that she also spoke with the CEO of the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, Wendy Bart, and said that she told Bart there should be warnings that the bathrooms were also used by trans individuals.

​​""I told her there were no signs posted to give women warning,"" Jaman told Monson. ""She said there were Pride posters posted all over and she assumed that was adequate to inform women what to expect."" Bart also said, ""‘we take pride and everyone is welcome,’"" according to Jaman’s description of the conversation.

""That’s fine with me, except that they do not provide alternatives for women who choose not to be undressing in front of men,"" Jaman continued in the radio interview. ""Our pool is a very old pool. We just have two shower rooms, dressing rooms, one for men, one for women.""

Getting more exercise could be linked to a longer life.

A new 12-page research article published in the American Heart Association’s Circulation Journal found that people who got extra exercise had a lower mortality rate compared to those who did not.

The study, which was conducted by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, was published on Monday, July 25.

Over a 30-year period from 1988 to 2018, a total of 116,221 adults were monitored and submitted exercise reports that detailed their ""leisure-time physical activity.""

Mortality reduction was observed in study participants who got 150 to 300 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week and 300 to 600 minutes of moderate physical activity.

Vigorous exercisers who participated in activities like jogging, running, climbing stairs, swimming, bicycling, aerobics, playing sports and working outdoors for 150 to 299 minutes, had a lower mortality rate between 21% and 23% for all causes of death.

This exercise group also had lower cardiovascular deaths between 27% and 33% and lower non-cardiovascular deaths by 19%. People who exercised vigorously for more than 300 minutes per week ""did not have further lower mortality,"" according to the study.

Moderate exercisers, on the other hand, who participated in activities like walking, weightlifting performing lower-intensity workouts and calisthenics for 150 to 299 minutes, had a lower mortality rate between 20% and 21% for all causes of death.

In terms of cardiovascular deaths, moderate exercisers had a 22% to 25% lower chance, and for non-cardiovascular deaths, moderate exercisers had a 19% to 20% lower chance.

People who exercised moderately for 300 to 599 minutes per week had ""3% to 13% further lower mortality,"" according to the study.

Researchers behind the study documented 47,596 deaths during its observation.

""The nearly maximum association with lower mortality was achieved by performing ≈150 to 300 min/wk of long-term leisure-time [vigorous physical activity], 300 to 600 min/wk of long-term leisure-time [moderate physical activity], or an equivalent combination of both,"" the team wrote in the study’s conclusion.

However, the study’s participants were pulled from surveys collected by the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which may have skewed results.

Most of the study participants were in their 60s, had a normal BMI, rarely ate more than 2,000 calories per day, drank alcohol occasionally and hardly smoked.

There was a lack of racial diversity as well with more than 90% of study participants being White.

CAREER CHALLENGE: SHOULD YOU SOCIALIZE WITH YOUR BOSS OUTSIDE OF THE WORKPLACE?

While you’re traveling, fitness experts say you don’t need fancy gyms, pricey equipment or an abundance of free time to incorporate fitness into your business travel schedule. To make sure get some exercise in while you're away, try these smart tips.

1. Use the hotel's amenities if you can

Aim for a hotel with a gym, a pool and one that’s in a pedestrian-friendly location.

You can swim laps in the pool, use cardio equipment and do weight-training in the fitness center and walk around the area where your hotel is located.

As a fitness professional who travels to certify trainers around the country, Cary Williams, CEO of Boxing & Barbells in Santa Monica, California, said she does her best to book a hotel with a gym when she’s traveling.

However, if you can’t find a hotel that offers all these amenities — don’t worry.

THESE ARE THE BEST FOODS FOR YOUR HEART, EXPERTS SAY

""If there is not a gym or the gym is closed, there are plenty of exercises you can do in your room without equipment,"" Williams said.

Also, to get your steps in, skip the elevator and use the stairs, she advised.

2. Do an in-room workout

The best plan, said Williams, is to set your alarm an hour earlier while out of town so that you have at least a good 30-45 minutes to get in a workout.

She recommends an interval type of workout with about six exercises: three body weight exercises and three cardio-types of exercises.

""Find a timer app on your phone and set it for 45 seconds of work time and 15 second rest time between exercises,"" she said.

Williams curated an example of a room workout. She said each of the following exercises should take six minutes (aim for five rounds): squats; knee ups (high knees in place); push-ups; jumping rope (bring you own); lunges; and sit-ups.

You can add some weights to your workout if you have your own — or you can use dumbbells from the hotel’s gym.

3. Explore your surroundings

Chelsea Cohen, co-founder of SoStocked, in Austin, Texas, said fitness is a vital part of her daily routine. When she is traveling for work, her goal is to ensure the same.

""Exploring keeps me fit,"" said Cohen. ""Each business trip comes with a new opportunity to explore and indulge in exciting activities.""

She added, ""Whenever I’m in a new city, I make sure that I walk around a bit whether it’s for shopping or finding a good restaurant.""

Cohen said she prioritizes taking a walking path to her work meetings.

HOW TO KNOW IF YOUR SUNSCREEN IS EXPIRED

""This helps keep my body in motion,"" she said. ""The best thing is that walking keeps my mind off the usual workouts and gives me the much-needed exercise without needing to carve extra time for it.""

Outside work meetings, pack a pair of sneakers and walk the area to learn about the new city and explore.

4. Embrace technology

As CEO of Brooklyn, NY-based MediaPeanut, Victoria Mendoza said she frequently travels for business; technology has helped keep her on track in terms of her fitness and health.

""I have recently learned to incorporate technology into my own fitness regimen,"" she said.

She uses several apps to help her with calorie counting, measuring calories burned during exercise and daily activities — and also measuring her daily steps and monitoring her exercise activities.

""Some of these popular apps are Fooducate, Strides, MyFitnessPal and Fitbit aside from the health trackers in my phone,"" she added.

""Setting aside an hour for a virtual fitness trainer session allows me to not stray from my fitness goals and correctly do my workouts, even with limited machines.""

Also, Mendoza said she’s hired virtual fitness trainers who monitor her fitness activities and plan her workouts at least twice or three times a week, even while she travels for work.

""Setting aside an hour for a virtual fitness trainer session allows me to not stray from my fitness goals and correctly do my workouts, even with limited machines."" She said the virtual trainers come up with ""exercise plans depending on the location and time and space that I have at my disposal.""

5. Cycle your way to health

Jarelle Parker, a Silicon Valley personal trainer in Menlo Park, California, suggested booking a bike tour around a new city.

""This is a great way to meet people and to be adventurous by exploring a new environment,"" she said. ""It's also a great way to incorporate fitness into your travel.""

She mentioned that Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, New York and San Diego ""have amazing bike tours for fitness travelers.""

If indoor cycling is more the preference (along with others to help motivate you), Parker noted that the ClassPass app can help.

Ella Halikas has gone viral for recreating some of Julia Fox’s most daring looks – but for the SI Swimsuit model, it was a no-brainer.

""I remember she was wearing the low-rise look, and I was like, ‘Ooh, the low-rise is coming back,’"" the 24-year-old chuckled to Fox News Digital. ""And I remember people who were a lot curvier were scared of that. I would come across videos on TikTok of girls saying, ‘There’s no way I’m participating in this trend. I don’t have the right body.’ My first thought was, ‘Why not?’ Obviously, we have different body types, but I also love to showcase my body. And I thought if I could wear this, someone else might feel they can too. We can feel just as confident and beautiful together. I wanted to start that conversation.""

The curve model took to Instagram where she posted side-by-side photos of herself and Fox, 32, wearing similar looks. Some pieces Halikas wore included black and white Calvin Klein underwear while grocery shopping, as well as a cropped white tank top and a mini skirt paired with black patent gloves and boots – two recognizable styles from the fellow model.

Halikas said she received an overwhelming amount of support after the photos went viral.

""I wanted to show people you can rock whatever you want, you can feel just as confident and beautiful,"" the California native shared. ""I wanted other girls to be seen. I wanted others to feel good in their skin and be encouraged to try wearing something they feel they could never wear. I’ve gotten such a great reaction from people, and they’re loving it. I mean, it takes time, effort and money to organize all these shoots that are unpaid. But it’s a great feeling to know it’s encouraging others to showcase their bodies.""

According to Halikas, she actually went to a grocery store in Beverly Hills to mimic Fox’s supermarket look.

""The secret to making Julia Fox’s look – or any look for that matter – your own is confidence,"" she explained. ""It’s not so much about body type. It’s about how you carry yourself. It’s not about how you look physically. It’s about how you feel mentally. You have to walk with your chest up high and feel good. When you see the photos, you have to feel the confidence, the energy. That’s what makes people go, ‘She looks good.’ If I had walked to that store all covered up and my chin down looking nervous, people would say, ‘That’s not flattering, put some clothes on. What are you doing?’ You have to own your body and you have to own your look. If you can have that mental shift and find that confidence, then you can pull off anything.""

Halikas said the ""Uncut Gems"" star has not reached out to her personally after the photos went viral, but she has seen them.

""She would look at my Stories [on Instagram],"" Halikas explained. ""She liked both of my posts. She’s just never commented or personally reach out… But this isn’t really about mimicking a celebrity or about Julia Fox personally. It’s more about recreating a style and showing it on a different body type. I would love to start doing different celebrities and other thinner women like Bella Hadid. ""

The star first made a splash in 2021 when she was photographed by veteran photographer Yu Tsai in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for SI Swimsuit. Halikas, who has been inspired by Ashley Graham and Hunter McGrady, said it has always been a dream of hers to appear in the magazine.

""The shoot just felt like a dream,"" she recalled. ""I even connected with Ashley Graham. She sent me a voice message the morning of my shoot. I remember she said, ‘I’m so proud of you, you should be proud of yourself. You’ve come so far.’ I just started crying. I stayed up late the night before my shoot watching videos of her modeling on YouTube to get some inspiration. So I couldn’t believe my role model was cheering me on. I felt empowered. What I love about this brand is that the girls are so uplifting and encouraging. You couldn’t find a more supportive sisterhood.""

""I remember when the magazine finally came out, I was searching all around San Francisco where I was for a shoot, going to every Walgreens, CVS, library, Barnes & Noble,"" Halikas continued. ""I couldn’t find it anywhere. After hours of searching, I had to go to the airport and get on a flight to Miami. I went to a newsstand there and saw it on the wall. I immediately grabbed it. I got a full page in the issue… I was so proud that I made it that far.""

Today, Halikas hopes that her body will serve as an inspiration to other women who ""deserve to be seen"" in the fashion industry.

""It’s been super important for me to talk about the difference between body positivity and body neutrality,"" she explained. ""Body positivity is when you accept your body, not really wanting to change it. Body neutrality means you love your body, but you’re OK with change too. I’m more neutral. I love my body, and I’m very positive about it, but there are things that I believe can make me stronger. I’m always looking to be the best version of myself… I enjoy working out and for me, it’s way more than just trying to lose weight. I’m not even thinking about weight or needing to lose. I’m thinking, ‘How can I get more toned? How can I feel healthier? How can I help my anxiety? How can I improve my mental health?’""

The model shared that she relies on consistent Pilates and weight-lifting to challenge herself, all while improving her mental health. She is also an avid fan of soccer, hot yoga and the occasional jog.

""The advice I would give to anyone who is intimidated by the gym is that nobody in there is worried about you,"" she advised. ""They’re more into themselves. In life, we always think people are looking at us and judging, whether it’s when we’re wearing a new outfit or at the gym. Most people, especially nowadays, are just so concerned with themselves. If you’re intimidated, get a workout buddy or meet with a trainer. If the weight room looks scary because it’s just a bunch of guys, hop on a treadmill. You can also go to a room alone and do some cardio. I also go to a Pilates class, and I’m probably the biggest girl there… but in a way, it empowers me. I’m thinking, ‘Yeah, I’m twice your size, but look what I can do.’ Health and fitness look different in every single body. I’m all about feeling strong to be my best self.""

""More importantly, don’t compare yourself to others, especially when everyone is out right now wearing a bikini,"" she said. ""There’s so much power in just being you. You are unique. Don’t lose sight of that. It’s easier said than done, but it’s not fun comparing yourself to everyone else. Embrace who you are and what you’re capable of."""

It wasn’t the first time for the model, who first covered the magazine in 1979 and then set a record by landing the covers for the next two years. But this time, the star was having second thoughts.

Brinkley told the August/September 2022 issue of Long Island Woman that the opportunity ""came about suddenly.""

The shoot took place at their family home in Turks and Caicos. While Brinkley has led a successful career being in the spotlight, she still faced some insecurities posing once more in bikinis.

""The second you start thinking about being in ‘Sports Illustrated’ you start thinking about, ‘Oh, do we stack up?’"" Brinkley explained. ""Everybody gets a little insecure. It was kind of interesting for everybody to be together there and sort of address their insecurities and get it out there.""

""My girls have both had different fears having grown up in front of the scrutiny of the press, so I think it was fraught with a little bit of anxiety,"" she continued. ""But it was cathartic, I think. Everybody enjoyed the moment and having that experience together.""

Brinkley noted that having a positive outlook on life has been essential over the years.

""I’ve always been of the school of, ‘You just got to be grateful for whatever you got. You’ve got two arms, two legs, two eyes,’"" she said. ""It’s silly to stress about anything else. Be grateful. So what if it’s five pounds up, it’s you and it’s all good.""

These days, Brinkley is grateful that the modeling industry has become more inclusive over the years.

""The most beautiful thing about this beauty industry is that its arms are wide open trying to make sure that they embrace and celebrate every size, shape, age, race,"" she said. ""And that they see themselves and find themselves on the pages and feel good about themselves.""

While it’s been ""a great movement,"" Brinkley said there's more work to be done.

Because sometimes I don’t know what’s OK to wear,'"" she said. ""And I try and give people the message that, if you feel good in it, then it’s OK.""

Back in April 2021, Brinkley told Fox News Digital she hoped her latest swimsuit snaps, which often go viral, will inspire other women to celebrate themselves — no matter their age.

""I post these pictures because I hear from women my age all the time that say, ‘Thank you for changing the way people think about the numbers,’"" Brinkley said at the time. ""Back in the day, numbers represented something. I remember people thinking that after 30, you should never wear your hair past your shoulders or your hemline needed to hover your knee caps.""

""I’ve always found those rules so limiting,"" she said. ""Everybody’s different, everybody’s unique. But it’s like telling a gymnast she can’t do flips past a certain age. It doesn’t make sense.

Kelly Hughes made history this summer when she became the first model to bare her cesarean-section scar for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition in the magazine's 58-year history.

The outlet partnered with Frida Mom to raise awareness of Pay With Change, an initiative aimed to ""positively shift the mainstream cultural narratives associated with women’s bodies – especially when becoming a mom.""

The proud model and mom wore a nude-hued skimpy string bikini for the 2022 issue which features Kim Kardashian, Maye Musk, Ciara and Yumi Nu as this year’s cover girls.

Hughes delivered her now 3-year-old son via cesarean. She joins Katrina Scott, 2021’s Rookie of the Year, who was photographed when she was six and a half months pregnant, as well as Hunter McGrady, who posed for the outlet six months postpartum.

SI SWIMSUIT ISSUE MAKES HISTORY WITH MODEL KELLY HUGHES BARING C-SECTION SCAR: ‘OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME’

After Hughes' photo went viral, the founder and designer of the jewelry brand HÜES partnered with ESTAS Beauty to start the #ScarLoveChallenge on social media to spread a feeling of empowerment and change the societal stigma around scars. The challenge encourages participants to reinterpret Hughes' photo showing off their scars. Every time a #ScarLoveChallenge photo is posted, ESTAS will donate $1 to World of Children, helping disadvantaged children around the globe.

Hughes spoke to Fox News Digital about the struggles she endured during labor, the insecurities she faced after giving birth, as well as how she now responds to negative comments on Instagram.

Fox News: How did you get involved with SI Swimsuit?

Kelly Hughes: One of my friends in New York, who is also a model, saw that they were looking for a girl with a C-section scar, and they were shooting in the Florida Keys, which is close to me as I’m in Miami. I reached out to my agency, they proposed me and that’s how I got the job. It’s so wonderful because my friend is also a mother. And without her, I wouldn’t have gotten this opportunity. So it’s beautiful to see one mother supporting another mother.

Fox News: Take us back to your shoot. What was that like?

Hughes: I had a million things running through my mind before I even started shooting. I had never shown my scar before. And I have been really open with how I struggled with insecurities around my scar. I originally didn’t want a C-section because the bounce back was going to be much harder being that I’m a model.

Society just puts so much pressure on you to ""bounce back."" I wasn’t a size two anymore. I wasn’t doing too much modeling in a bikini in the first place. So it was scary at first to show my biggest insecurity in a magazine like Sports Illustrated. I wasn’t sure how I was going to be received.

Fox News: How were you received on set?

Hughes: As soon as I arrived, the editor just made me feel so confident and beautiful. She turned my insecurity into the most beautiful thing in the world. She just made me feel so much better about my scar. I felt so much more confident about myself. I just looked at my scar in the mirror and I realized I shouldn’t have to feel so insecure about this anymore. And when it was time to shoot, everyone reacted the same way. They made me feel so empowered and inspired. I imagine how many beautiful women they’ve seen, and now I get to be part of that representation. The experience was a healing one for me. It just really helped me to overcome my insecurities.

Fox News: How important was it for you to show off your C-section scar despite your insecurities?

Hughes: To be honest, I had no idea how much this would impact people. But my photo went viral all over the world. This is something I probably wouldn’t have done before, but I also didn’t see myself in the same way I see myself now. And I think it’s beautiful that a magazine like Sports Illustrated is showing a woman with a C-section and saying, ""she’s beautiful."" Now, I realize how important that photo is to me because I had no idea how underrepresented this was.

Apparently, one in three women are having C-sections now – that’s a large number of women. But this doesn’t just resonate with women who have C-sections. This also resonates with women who have scars in general and are insecure about them. The fashion industry has evolved, and they’re finally starting to embrace different women. We don’t have to all look the same. So this photo represents so much more than a C-section scar… I feel a true responsibility to continue this conversation.

FITNESS ICON DENISE AUSTIN, 65, AND DAUGHTER KATIE MODEL BIKINIS FOR SI SWIMSUIT RUNWAY SHOW: ‘PROUD MAMA’

Fox News: What went through your mind when you saw your photo for the first time?

Hughes: I just kept saying ""wow"" *laughs*. I will never forget that moment. We shot with six different bathing suits that day to have options. And for some reason, the moment I shot that picture, I just knew it was going to be chosen. It just shows pure joy. And I think that’s what we should feel when we look at our scars. It represents we overcame something difficult, and we’re here.

You know in the fashion industry, nobody wants to show cellulite. Nobody wants to show scars. But these things are normal, and they should be normalized. And when you see my photo, you just see pure joy. I was so insecure about my scar, but it also represents the most beautiful moment of my life because my son was born. So I should feel joy.

Fox News: Some critics have said, ""SI Swimsuit is a magazine of women in bikinis. Do we really need to see this?"" What would you tell those people?

Hughes: It’s interesting, I was shocked that about 99% of people that reached out to me have been supportive. Even the press I received after my photo went viral was supportive. Sure, sometimes people like to make their comments – it is Instagram – but I’ve gotten an overwhelming number of positive comments from both men and women. Of course, you still get comments like ""who cares?"" or ""she’s half-naked"" or ""we don’t want to see this"" – all those comments are generic. And the truth is, there will always be people out there who want to dim your light.

All I can say is I don’t understand how someone can make negative comments, especially on someone’s social media posts. There’s no need for it. You don’t gain anything from that. But the overwhelming amount of positive comments from people proves that something like this was needed. This is about representation. Think about those mothers out there with C-section scars wearing a bikini at the beach. Sometimes it peeks out.

SI SWIM MODEL VICTORIA VESCE RECALLS OVERCOMING ‘NIGHTMARE’ BRAIN TUMOR: ‘I HAD EVERY SYMPTOM IN THE BOOK’

I’ve received so many messages from women telling me they’ve felt so insecure going to the beach that they buy a bigger bikini or just choose to wear a one-piece to avoid the scrutiny. They go out of their way to not show the scar because they’re insecure about it. They’re worried about what people may say or think. Now, Sports Illustrated is having that conversation. It was so needed. You shouldn’t need to accommodate everyone else just so they can feel better. You’re so much more than any negative comment someone may have to say.

Now, I’m getting messages from women telling me how empowered they feel, and how confident they feel to wear that bikini again after having a baby. I hope that when people see my photo, they’ll feel encouraged to embrace themselves and give themselves grace. I look at my scar now, and I’m proud of what I went through. I embrace it. I’m still here. And that’s exactly what my photo shows. I just hope it can encourage others to feel the same.

Fox News: In 2018 you became a mom. But it sounded like you endured some challenges. What happened?

Hughes: My son was born in November 2018. During my pregnancy, I had nausea and all the typical things, but it wasn’t anything severe. I had a good pregnancy and I thought I was going to have a natural labor. I have read everything about natural labor, and I was ready for it. I never opened the door to the possibility of a C-section. I just wanted to bounce back as quickly as possible. I knew a C-section meant a longer recovery. But when I was in labor, unfortunately [the doctors] realized that my hips weren’t aligned. They were a bit shifted, which happens a lot in pregnancy. I didn’t realize this until it was time.

I had a very long labor – I was about 36 hours in, and I wasn’t dilating past seven centimeters. That’s when they recommended a C-section. At first, I was like, ""no, no, no."" But that was my first lesson in motherhood – you can’t plan for everything. I didn’t want to put my son’s health at risk or of course, my own. So I finally agreed. But two days later after I went home, I became really sick. I went back to the hospital, and it turned out I had a really bad infection. I spent eight days in the hospital and I underwent another surgery to remove the infection. Being separated from my son was so difficult. I wasn’t in the maternity unit anymore, and they didn’t want him in the hospital.

I just felt horrible. Like why did this happen to me? What did I do wrong? New moms especially, we put a lot of pressure on ourselves because we just want everything to be perfect. And the truth is, I don’t think this is discussed enough. There needs to be more conversations and education on all the million things that can happen during labor. But the most important thing is for mom and baby to be healthy. I wanted this perfect, natural birth to happen. It didn’t – and that’s OK. My son is here and so am I.

Fox News: After you gave birth and were recovering, did you still feel pressure to ""bounce back"" or look a certain way?

Hughes: I wish I could tell you that pressure went away I gave birth. It definitely didn’t. And I’m very honest about this… I’ve been modeling for 22 years. I have seen the fashion industry evolve in the last year and a half. But that shift hadn’t happened when I gave birth in November 2018. I did feel that pushback when I tried going back to work. I didn’t look the same as I did before. I certainly didn’t have the confidence.

I was very insecure. And I don’t think I was fully embraced quite yet. As a mom, you don’t always have time to go to the gym. Sometimes you don’t have time at all. And eating became whatever was in the house or whatever I could grab quickly, so I could get back to my son. My diet had changed. My routine had changed. The demands of my life had changed. But the truth is, once you give birth to a new person, you are not the same. So you shouldn’t feel pressure to be the same as you were before… It took time to finally embrace my scar and that’s OK. I no longer feel like I should be ashamed of it.

Fox News: What’s motherhood like today?

Hughes: It’s a blessing. I’m still modeling. My son and I did a photo shoot together for a company that offers clothing for breastfeeding moms. He was two months old. It was a little difficult because I wasn’t fully healed. I was still recovering from two surgeries. But it was an amazing experience. We’ve done quite a few photo shoots with him, and it’s been wonderful being with my son. He’s now three and a half, and it’s incredible.

Actor Ashton Kutcher recently disclosed his bout with an autoimmune condition that affected his hearing, vision and ability to walk.

Access Hollywood obtained footage of an interview from Monday night’s episode of National Geographic’s ""Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge,"" in which the actor spoke about a rare autoimmune disorder he developed not long ago called vasculitis.

The 44-year-old actor said in the interview, ""Two years ago, I had this weird, super-rare form of vasculitis, that, like, knocked out my vision, it knocked out my hearing, it knocked out, like, all my equilibrium,"" according to the Access Hollywood report.

ASHTON KUTCHER REVEALS VASCULITIS DIAGNOSIS, SAYS HE COULDN'T WALK, TALK OR HEAR

Kutcher also said in the interview, ""You don’t really appreciate it until it’s gone. Until you go, ‘I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to see again, I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to hear again, I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to walk again.’""

The Vasculitis Foundation says that ""vasculitis is a general term that refers to inflammation of the blood vessels.""

It notes as well, ""It is used to describe a family of nearly 20 rare diseases, characterized by narrowing, weakening or scarring of the blood vessels, which can restrict blood flow and damage vital organs and tissues.""

The disease can affect blood vessels such as arteries, capillaries and veins.

The Center for Vasculitis Care and Research at Cleveland Clinic said on its website that vasculitis is an autoimmune disease — in which the body mistakenly attacks its own healthy tissue — that contributes to inflammation of blood vessels.

Currently, researchers believe this inflammatory response may be triggered by infections, medications, environmental or genetic factors, allergic reactions or another disease process.

The disease can affect blood vessels such as arteries, capillaries and veins — and symptoms can range from mild to severe, and vary from person to person, the Cleveland Clinic experts said.

Symptoms also depend on the tissues and organs that are affected.

The actor said it took about a year for his senses to recover, according to the media report.

Rheumatologists said while some forms of vasculitis may improve on their own, others may require medical care throughout one’s life.

Treatment of the disease depends on the specific type of vasculitis and the areas/organs that are involved, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Treatment may include the use of corticosteroids — or, in some cases, medications that suppress the immune system.

Regardless of the severity, health experts said that early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important to avoid potentially life-threatening complications.

The actor said it took about a year for his senses to recover, according to the media report. ""I’m lucky to be alive,"" Kutcher said in the interview.

Scans of blood vessels and the heart, as well as tissue biopsies, may also be performed.

Common symptoms of the disease include the following list, according to the Ceveland Clinic.

Skin rashes

Fatigue

Weakness

Fever

Joint pains

Abdominal pain

Kidney problems (including dark or bloody urine)

Nerve problems (including numbness, weakness and pain)

Cough and/or shortness of breath

Also, other symptoms can occur, depending on the area of the body affected by vasculitis.

The Cleveland experts noted that if a small blood vessel is affected, it might break, producing small areas of bleeding in the tissue that appear as small red or purple dots on the skin.

They also noted a nodule or lump might be noticeable in the skin when a larger blood vessel close to the skin surface is inflamed.

A physician can diagnose vasculitis based on symptoms, a person’s medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests. Scans of blood vessels and the heart, as well as tissue biopsies, may also be performed, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Kutcher, who shares two children with his wife Mila Kunis — whom he met when they filmed their hit TV series, ""That '70s Show"" — spoke about overcoming challenges.

""The minute you start seeing your obstacles as things that are made for you, to give you what you need, and then life starts to get fun, right?"" Kutcher said in the Bear Grylls interview, according to Access Hollywood.

Italy opened its vaccination campaign against monkeypox on Monday as case numbers have increased at a time when health authorities are reporting vaccine shortages worldwide.

Italy has reported 545 cases of monkeypox, according to the health ministry. Its vaccination campaign has started more than a month after other countries that have seen higher numbers of cases, including the United States, Britain and Spain.

The first doses will be given at the Spallanzani hospital in Rome, the hospital said in a statement.

SPAIN CONFIRMS FIRST MONKEYPOX-RELATED DEATH IN EUROPE

Vaccines and treatments have been in short supply and the disease often left for historically underfunded sexual health clinics to manage.

Spallanzani said it already has 200 people who will be vaccinated from Monday onwards, as well as 600 requests for bookings.

The vaccine used will be Jynneos (MVA-BN), a smallpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic and approved by the European Medicines Agency for protection against monkeypox, the hospital said.

On Thursday, vaccinations will also begin in Italy's financial capital, Milan.

The virus continues to be largely transmitted among gay and bisexual men in the current outbreak spreading outside endemic countries, which began in May. Monkeypox is spread chiefly by close contact, causes pus-filled sores and flu-like symptoms, and is rarely fatal. There have now been 26,500 cases worldwide outside the countries where it usually spreads, according to a Reuters tracker.

In July, the World Health Organization declared monkeypox a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" its highest alert level.

Following the WHO's move, the United States — which now has the most cases in the world — also declared monkeypox a public health emergency on Aug. 4.

Italy's Health ministry said gay, bisexual men and transgender people who have recently had sex with multiple partners, recently had a sexually transmitted infection or use chemical drugs when having sex, would be eligible for the vaccine. Hospital staff dealing with monkeypox cases are also eligible.

The first case in Italy was recorded on May 20, 2022. There are no current plans for mass vaccinations.

""Based on the weather radar, we decided to deviate north and were still getting very strong returns on the onboard weather radar,"" Frans said. ""The clouds were too tall to be able to visually determine a safe route, so we were relying on (air traffic control) reports, the satellite radar report and the onboard weather radar to attempt to navigate a safe path through.""

Frans said they had to veer north across Lake Superior to stay out of the worst of it.

A bumpy ride awaits those who dare enter

But along the journey of their equipment reposition flight, Frans documented rapid development of the cumulonimbus clouds, as heat from below raced skyward into the much cooler atmosphere, exploding into convection along the way. The flat tops of the storms in the distance are informally known as anvil tops due to their obvious resemblance to anvils.

HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER ON TV

Anvils are caused when the rising air hits a stable layer of the atmosphere where the temperature profile prevents the clouds from rising further, instead acting like an invisible wall where the clouds will then spread out along the boundary layer. They're signs of a mature thunderstorm and something you want to avoid flying through as a pilot.

""We would have probably encountered at least moderate turbulence and likely worse,"" Frans said. ""Generally the tops of clouds – especially cumulus – dump a TON of ice into the airframe as you fly through, so the windshield (where it's not heated) would instantly be covered in ice.""

What's more, with temperatures below freezing and strong updrafts in the clouds, the precipitation you'd be flying through is not rain, but hail.

LIGHTNING STRIKES ON AIRPLANES CAN BE SCARY - JUST ASK MILEY CYRUS

""So it would be very loud with 1/4-inch ice balls slamming into the windscreen at 400 mph,"" Frans said. ""And of course the planes are designed to take most of that but if it's severe that's beyond what it's designed for. Also, it can be dangerous if people aren't seat-belted in.""

Spanish coast guard divers rescued a 62-year-old French sailor who survived for 16 hours inside an air bubble of his capsized vessel as it drifted in the Atlantic Ocean, officials said Tuesday.

Spain's Maritime Safety and Rescue Society located the French sailboat Jeanne SOLO Sailor overturned about 14 miles from the Sisargas Islands off Spain's northwestern Galicia region, the agency said.

The 40-foot boat had set sail from Lisbon, Portugal, on Sunday morning, and sent a distress signal just before 9 p.m. on Monday, Reuters reported, citing the coast guard.

Rescuers located the overturned ship, and one diver was winched onto the hull to investigate whether anyone was alive, officials said. The trapped man responded to the diver’s knocks on the hull by knocking back.

Divers described the rescue operation as ""verging on the impossible,"" the outlet reported.

The waters were too rough to attempt a rescue until morning, the agency said. Rescuers attached buoyancy devices to the hull to prevent the ship from sinking further.

Once morning arrived, two divers swam under the sailboat and found the man, who has not been identified, in water up to his knees.

If voters approve the constitutional amendment on marijuana, those age 21 and older could buy and grow it for personal consumption as early as this year.

Missouri voters approved medical marijuana use in 2018. Efforts to allow recreational marijuana use have failed to pass Missouri's Republican-led Legislature for years, prompting advocates to go to voters for approval instead.

Recreational marijuana is already legal in 19 states, and legalization proposals are on the ballot this fall in South Dakota and Maryland. Supporters are also trying to get measures on the ballot in Arkansas, North Dakota and Oklahoma.

Backers of the Missouri ballot proposal are highlighting a provision that would erase past marijuana-related convictions for nonviolent offenders and those whose conviction didn’t include selling to minors or driving while high.

Local NAACP chapters, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, criminal defense lawyers and other civil rights advocacy groups endorsed automatic expungement, and it could broaden support for the initiative among Republican criminal justice advocates. Seven other states with legal recreational marijuana have also adopted automatic expungement policies.

Marijuana sales would be taxed at 6% under the Missouri measure. The tax is estimated to bring in more than $46 million during the first full year the amendment is in effect and close to $70 million the following year. Revenues would be earmarked for veterans’ homes, drug treatment programs and public defenders.

Cities and other municipalities could enact local sales taxes on recreational marijuana up to 3% or enact local bans on non-medical marijuana sales by a public vote.

Ashcroft said a separate proposal to allow ranked-choice voting failed to collect the roughly 170,000 voter signatures from six of the state’s eight congressional districts to get on the ballot.

Under that proposal, candidates from all parties would have been listed on primary ballots beginning in August 2024, meaning voters could pick from Republicans and Democrats without requesting a party-specific ballot. The top four candidates with the most votes would move on to the general election, when voters could either pick only their favorite or rank the candidates from first to last.

Better Elections spokesman Scott Charton said in a statement that proponents would honor supporters ""with continued work"" on the issue.
