The FBI’s decision to execute a search warrant at former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home on Monday is ""unprecedented"" – especially for a non-sitting commander-in-chief and one who has indicated he might run again, a former special-agent-in-charge told Fox News Digital on Monday.

""We just haven’t investigated presidents after they’ve served their term,"" Michael Tabman, former head of the FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office, said. ""But it is a huge move by the FBI in that the political sensitivities are clear. It's obvious that they're dealing on a very, sort of tenuous political climate when you go out and you investigate a president, especially one who says he may run for office again.""

Trump announced on Monday that his palatial Florida residence had been raided early in the morning. Sources told Fox News Digital the search was in connection with materials that Trump took with him from his time as president. Sources also said National Archives and Records Administration referred the case to the Justice Department, which recovered 15 boxes of classified materials from the home.

But Tabman, who is now retired and not involved in the FBI’s investigation into Trump, noted that securing a search warrant ""is no minor task.""

""You have to certainly, as most people know, produce probable cause … to first get prosecutors who want to write this and present it to a judge – and then present it to a judge who has to agree that you have shown probable cause that a crime has been committed, there is evidence of the crime in the location that you state and at the time you plan to execute the warrant,"" he said, by phone. ""So, there's a lot of information that you have to be very convincing of to a federal judge and they scrutinize these.""

Asked about the potential for a search warrant to be politicized, he said any system ""can be corrupted,"" but in an instance such as this, the search warrant affidavit will at some point be public.

After former President Trump 's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida was raided by FBI agents, Republicans are slamming the Biden administration and accusing the Department of Justice of ""political weaponization,"" while Democrats are lauding the agency for holding Trump accountable for ""wrongdoing.""

""The raid of MAL is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves,"" said Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. ""Now the Regime is getting another 87k IRS agents to wield against its adversaries? Banana Republic.""

Multiple sources tell Fox News the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago is related to the materials Trump allegedly brought to his private residence after his presidency concluded. That matter was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy issued a warning to Attorney General Merrick Garland that extensive oversight by Republicans in Congress will be heading his way.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA 'UNDER SIEGE' BY FBI AGENTS

""Attorney General Garland: preserve your documents and clear your calendar,"" wrote McCarthy.

South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem blasted Biden's FBI, calling the agency's actions ""un-American"" in a statement posted to Twitter Monday evening.

""The FBI raid on President Trump’s home is an unprecedented political weaponization of the Justice Department. They’ve been after President Trump as a candidate, as President, and now as a former President. Using the criminal justice system in this manner is un-American,"" wrote Noem.

""Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before. After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said Monday.

DOJ REPORTEDLY INVESTIGATING TRUMP'S CONDUCT, CONVERSATIONS AS PART OF 2020 ELECTION PROBE

""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System , and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections,"" the former president continued.

However, ""Squad"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said the FBI is working toward ""accountability"" and went as far as to say Trump should be in prison.

""That’s what happens when you break the law, try to steal an election, and incite a deadly insurrection. Donald Trump should be in jail. I’m glad to see the FBI taking steps towards accountability.""

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., called Trump's statement ""defensive"" during an MSNBC segment Monday.

""But look, the FBI doesn't just go in unless a judge signs off on a search warrant. That means they have some probable evidence about possible wrongdoing. And it's something that the whole country needs to pay attention to and shows that Justice Garland, Attorney General Garland is setting this up step by step,"" he stated.

""I think Attorney General Garland and the Justice Department have done a very good job by following the facts,"" he said. ""I do think that this gives me confidence that the Justice Department is really pursuing this thoroughly, objectively and in a nonpolitical way,"" Khanna continued.

Congressional Republicans also took to Twitter, criticizing the FBI's ""unprecedented"" raid.

""The only thing missing from the unprecedented FBI raid at President Trump’s home is Muammar Gaddafi’s sunglasses and cap on Joe Biden,"" wrote Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.

Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., asked on Twittter: ""What does the FBI know about Hunter Biden?""

GOP Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana mentioned the $739 billion Manchin-Schumer bill that just passed the senate, which expanded the IRS, in his rebuke of the FBI's action.

""If the FBI can raid the home of a former US President, imagine what 87,000 more IRS agents will do to you,"" he quipped on Twitter.

South Carolina Senator Tim Scott echoed Banks' sentiment on Mark Levin's radio show.

""Biden is dividing our country and the DOJ seems to be reinforcing that division through their actions… that is very dangerous to the everyday person walking on the streets of America,"" Scott said to Levin on Monday night.

""We must have 100% confidence and trust in our justice system,"" the Republican senator added. ""And if they can target a former president, you know, they could target me and you.""

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel called the raid ""outrageous.""

""Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Countless times we have examples of Democrats flouting the law and abusing power with no recourse, including Hunter Biden. Democrats continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans. This raid is outrageous,"" she wrote on Twitter.

Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority.

FIRST ON FOX: Veteran political strategists James Carville and Ed Rollins aren't quite seeing eye to eye on the political impact the FBI's raid on former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home could have on the midterm elections.

Speaking with Fox News Digital Tuesday, Carville, who was an adviser to former President Bill Clinton, said there wasn't enough information about the raid to know just yet what it could mean for voters heading to the polls.

But Rollins, a Republican, predicted the event could end up being the ""biggest issue in the midterms.""

""The attorney general and the FBI need to explain to the American public what they were doing and why,"" Rollins, an adviser to former President Ronald Reagan, said when asked about the raid.

ERIC TRUMP GIVES CLEAREST INDICATION YET OF POSSIBLE TRUMP 2024 RUN FOLLOWING FBI RAID

""This is an invasion of a man's home … and the public has a right to know why.""

He added that Trump had a right to know if he was being suspected of committing a crime and that it was his right to defend himself.

""To argue they are gathering evidence is not good enough. Trump not only is a former president, but certainly is the front-runner for a future nomination and possible re-election,"" Rollins said.

""This could become the biggest issue in the midterms, and the ruthless abuse of power could overcome all else. It has already stepped on all other news that Biden and his team wanted to promote on his legislative record,"" Rollins added.

He was referring to the passage of a number of Democrat-backed legislative priorities being overshadowed by news of the raid.

Carville took a different tone, appearing more hesitant to say the Mar-a-Lago raid would play a central role either way in upcoming elections.

He did, however, warn ""right-wing"" media personalities and commentators to ""tread very carefully"" in criticizing the raid, arguing that the documents and data the FBI had to justify the raid were likely ""substantial.""

When asked how he thought it might affect voters' decisions as they head to the polls in November, Carville said, ""We don't know because we have to find out more facts.""

Carville then argued that if Trump's claims that the raid was political were true, then he should make the search warrant public.

""I can't imagine that that search warrant said anything less than something just overwhelming. And if it's not, then Trump can make it public,"" he said.

The White House said Tuesday that President Biden and White House staff learned of the FBI’s unprecedented raid on former President Trump’s home at Mar-a-Lago through public reports ""just like the American people did,"" and stressed Biden's commitment to Justice Department investigations ""free of political influence.""

Trump’s private residence in Palm Beach, Florida, was raided by the FBI Monday morning, when the former president was in New York City. The raid was connected to an investigation into classified records Trump allegedly took with him from the White House to his home when he left office in January 2021.

When asked whether Biden or any White House officials were aware of the raid or had been briefed, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said they were not.

Jean-Pierre said the president and White House officials learned about the raid ""from public reports.""

""It would not be appropriate for us to comment on any ongoing investigations,"" she said.

Jean-Pierre said Biden ""intends to run in 2024"" but would not comment on whether he stands by his past statements suggesting he would like to run again Trump again.

FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland were aware of the raid, per standard protocol, and would have been fully briefed on it, a source told Fox News.

An FBI source confirmed to Fox News that FBI agents who conducted the raid were from Washington, D.C., and were on the bureau's Evidence Response Team. The agents notified the Miami Field Office just before the raid.

A source familiar told Fox News that agents brought a ""safe cracker"" and cracked a ""relatively new"" safe in Mar-a-Lago. The source told Fox News there was ""nothing in it.""

A source familiar told Fox News that FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago and looked in every single office and safe, and grabbed documents and boxes without going through them on the property. They took boxes and documents to go through them later.

""They were not being judicious about what they took,"" the source told Fox News.

Trump made the raid public Monday evening, saying in a lengthy statement that ""nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.""

""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said. ""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections.""

""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before,"" Trump said.

""What is the difference between this and Watergate, where operatives broke into the Democrat National Committee?"" he continued. ""Here, in reverse, Democrats broke into the home of the 45th President of the United States.""

When asked Tuesday if the White House is weaponizing the Justice Department against its political opponents, Jean-Pierre replied: ""The president believes in the rule of law.""

""We are not going to comment on a criminal investigation. The president has been very clear,"" she said.

McConnell was in his home state after floods recently hit the eastern part of his state, killing dozens. President Biden and Jill Biden even visited the state Monday in the wake of the natural disaster.

The minority leader's refusal to talk about the search warrant served on Trump's private home comes as Senate GOP leadership has been slower than their House counterparts to comment on the raid.

Sources told Fox News Digital the search was in connection with materials that Trump took with him from his time as president. Sources also said National Archives and Records Administration referred the case to the Justice Department, which recovered 15 boxes of classified materials from the home.

CLINTON-LINKED LAWYER SAYS TRUMP COULD BE BARRED FROM RE-ELECTION DUE TO FBI RAID, CITES US CODE

On Monday evening, FBI agents executed a search warrant of Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. Sources told Fox News Digital that the search was part of the DOJ's investigation into whether Trump improperly took government materials from his time in office.

The FBI agents confiscated 15 boxes of classified materials during the raid, according to the sources.

GOP SLAMS 'WEAPONIZATION' OF DOJ AFTER TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RAIDED BY FBI; DEMS CALL IT 'ACCOUNTABILITY'

""Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before,"" Trump said in a statement Monday. ""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate.""

In response, Republican lawmakers, conservative commentators and some Democrats expressed serious concern that the raid was politically motivated. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., threatened to probe the DOJ over the raid if the GOP takes majority control in the fall while House Republican Study Committee Chair Jim Banks, R-Ind., said the action was ""un-American.""

""DOJ must immediately explain the reason for its raid & it must be more than a search for inconsequential archives or it will be viewed as a political tactic and undermine any future credible investigation & legitimacy of January 6 investigations,"" former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., tweeted.

However, the DOJ and FBI have remained silent despite the heavy criticism.

""Attorney General Merrick Garland surely knew this raid would rekindle suspicions that this could be another example of what fired FBI official Peter Strzok once called an ‘insurance policy’ against Trump becoming president in 2016 — only this time in 2024,"" Jonathan Turley tweeted.

""For that reason, the Justice Department has an added burden to show this raid was a step toward actual criminal prosecution and not just a political indemnification,"" he continued.

George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley weighed in on the raid online, writing that for ""Trump foes, this is the long-awaited moment of FBI agents swarming over Trump’s property in a concrete step toward criminal prosecution.""

""For his supporters, it confirms a long-standing agenda of an FBI willing to target Trump on any grounds possible,"" Turley wrote.

Bob Barnes, the man who has been cycling to all 50 U.S. state capitals in one year, spotted two major landmarks while he was riding through South Dakota and North Dakota recently.

But beyond that, happy memories of his positive interactions with residents of these states and his experiences in both states have stayed with him.

Barnes, 52, of Syracuse, N.Y., reached his 43rd capital, Pierre, on May 27. He arrived at capital no. 44, Bismarck, on June 2. Amid his journey through the two states, Barnes said he experienced historic sites, a memorable meal and ""jaw-dropping"" scenery at a national park.

NY MAN CYCLING ACROSS AMERICA HITS SC, REVEALS THE ONE RELIGIOUS SYMBOL HE'S SEEN NATIONWIDE

Here are more specifics of what he saw as he neared the end of his all-American biking trip — and why these experiences stood out for him.

'Every single person is friendly'

Barnes arrived in South Dakota on May 24.

The very next day, he rode through the city of De Smet, where the Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Homes are located.

Wilder, an American author, wrote the ""Little House on the Prairie"" book series. She and her family lived in De Smet for several years.

Barnes said he had no idea Wilder's home was in De Smet until he noticed signs three blocks away.

""I was like, ‘Wow that is really cool,’"" Barnes told Fox News Digital. ""That was the real deal. That was a nice experience.""

Overall, Barnes said he loved his time in South Dakota.

""I think South Dakota was the friendliest overall state that I’ve been through,"" he said.

""Every single person is friendly. Everybody’s in a good mood, and it’s actually catching.""

Barnes said everyone he met during his time there waved at him and said hello.

""They just come up and talk to you,"" Barnes said.

""I’ve had more people come up and talk to me in South Dakota than any other state.""

""It’s awesome,"" he added. ""It’s fun … I just soak it in.""

Barnes pointed out that while he was cycling, he didn't come across many people on the road — and that, at times, he felt ""a little lonely.""

""But you just keep going,"" he said. ""You know where the next town is and you just get to it.""

Barnes said he had one of his best weeks of riding through South Dakota, reaching 433 miles in one week.

""That was really cool,"" Barnes said. ""That was a confidence booster. I know now what I have physically and I’m even more confident I’ll get [the trip] done.""

It helped that the terrain wasn’t so bad — and that drivers gave Barnes a lot of space on the road.

""South Dakota was kind of flawless,"" Barnes said about his ride.

""We did a lot of miles in South Dakota, but we got in, we got out,"" he said, referring to himself and his set of wheels. ""It was a very efficient ride through South Dakota.""

American state with ‘the best scenery'

Barnes arrived in North Dakota on May 30.

Just before reaching his 44th capital of Bismarck, on June 2, Barnes donated platelets — something he's been doing at various points along his journey as he works to raise awareness about the importance of donating blood and helping others.

""That was the first time I did my donation and visited a capital [in the same day], so that’s like a home run,"" Barnes said of his accomplishment.

Barnes said his platelet donation went well.

""They treated me like a celebrity — I get a little embarrassed when that happens,"" he added.

""They actually bought me food,"" Barnes said.

""They bought me Famous Dave’s. They bought me a brisket sandwich and that was good.""

Barnes also got to enjoy a tasty meal of chicken and dumplings at a restaurant called The Grill in Linton, North Dakota.

""It was one of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life,"" Barnes said.

""I’ve never had dumplings before.""

On his way out of the state, Barnes saw the Badlands, the landforms in western North Dakota.

""That was fantastic,"" Barnes said. ""That was some of the best scenery in the entire country.""

He continued, ""That was definitely a high point and a surprise. It just came out of nowhere and it was … jaw-dropping.""

Barnes even came across a herd of wild mustangs. ""They were beautiful,"" he said. ""Just so cool.""

While he was in North Dakota, Barnes went through his belongings to prepare for the final part of his trip, he said.

He threw away his two camping chairs, his dress clothes and shoes, three broken cellphones — and extra tent items like poles, covers and stakes.

He also collected all his loose change, which he said weighed about two pounds. He planned to use the change at a nearby store.

""I intently went to a convenience store and I was going to buy some scratch-off tickets and give them to the clerk just to be a nice person,"" Barnes explained.

""But they don’t sell scratch-offs in North Dakota.""

Later, Barnes left behind his trailer — which carried most of his belongings — and instead packed everything in his saddlebags attached to his bike.

Barnes said he left his trailer and hammock behind, along with a note saying the items were free for the taking.

Barnes did keep his French press, his stove, some clothes, his sandals and his solar panel, which helps him charge his phone.

Leaving his trailer behind, he said, ""made a remarkable difference.""

""I’ll never pull a trailer again,"" he said.

Next stop: Treasure State

After Bob Barnes left North Dakota on June 4, he arrived in Montana, heading for capital no. 45 on his trip: Helena.

After visiting all of the Lower 48 states, he took a ferry to Juneau, Alaska, from Canada and rode on his bicycle to the capitol — as he previously shared with Fox News Digital that he would be doing.

From there, he flew with his bike to Hawaii and rode from the airport to the capitol building to complete his trip.

The Statue of Liberty, perhaps the most celebrated symbol of American ideals and exceptionalism, reopened after the 9/11 attacks on this day in history, August 3, 2004.

The globally recognized landmark had been closed to the public for nearly three years following the destruction of the nearby World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.

Lady Liberty stood stoically watching over the horror in Lower Manhattan that day, little more than a mile across New York Harbor.

""This beacon of hope and liberty is once again open to the public, sending a reassuring message to the world that freedom is alive in New York and shining brighter than ever before,"" said then-Gov. George Pataki, as he reopened the Statue of Liberty along with Michael Bloomberg, NYC's then-mayor, plus the Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton, other officials and members of the public.

The celebration featured pomp and circumstance, including a performance of ""You're a Grand Old Flag"" and the national anthem by a military choir.

But the event also came amid concerns about terror attacks that loomed over the nation long after 9/11. New York City, nearby Newark, N.J. and Washington, D.C., all faced terror threats in the days before the reopening ceremony.

""I think it shows the world that liberty cannot be intimidated,"" Craig Manson, assistant interior secretary, said before the festivities.

""I think it's significant that despite the raising of the alert levels, we are still going ahead with the reopening.""

STATUE OF LIBERTY'S ‘LITTLE SISTER’ ARRIVES IN UNITED STATES FROM FRANCE IN TIME FOR FOURTH OF JULY

The Statue of Liberty, a gift from the people of France, opened to the public in 1886. French sculptor Frederic Bartholdi conceived of it; he visited the United States in 1871 after serving his nation in the Franco-Prussian War.

Lady Liberty's interior metal framework was fabricated by Gustave Eiffel, who immediately afterward began building the iconic tower in Paris that bears his name.

The Statue of Liberty has been shuttered for various reasons through its history.

It was closed for two years from 1984 to 1986 for extensive restoration work before its centennial celebration.

The scaffolding around the Statue of Liberty became a pop-culture symbol of the 1980s that appeared in everything from movies to music videos.

The Statue of Liberty closed again to the public for four months at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, before a phased period of reopening began in July.

Visitors could access the statue's famous torch for the first 30 years of its existence.

But public access to the torch was ended following the deadly ""Black Tom explosion"" of July 30, 1916.

The Statue of Liberty's torch was among the structures damaged by explosion fragments.

As the U.S. contemplated entry into World War I, German spies sabotaged a barge in New York Harbor filled with an estimated 2 million pounds of arms and munitions destined for Allies in Europe. The horrific explosion could be felt as far away as Philadelphia.

Talk about crushing the competition.

Lat 35 Racing's first all-female rowing team took on the biennial Great Pacific Race, challenging rowers to cross 2,400 nautical miles of Pacific Ocean from San Francisco, Calif., to Waikiki, Hawaii, as fast as possible.

The Lat 35 ladies — Libby Costello, Sophia Denison-Johnston, Brooke Downes and Adrienne Smith — crushed the competition.

They also set a global best for female contenders.

BREACHING WHALE JUMPS OUT OF OCEAN AND LANDS ON TOP OF A MASSACHUSETTS FISHING BOAT

The women finished the race in 34 days, 14 hours and 11 minutes, breaking the previous record by 24 hours.

Lat 35 partnered with the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) to raise money and awareness for mental health throughout the journey.

The team surpassed its goal of $10,000 — raising $12,083 for the cause as of current.

Teammate Brooke Downes shared the experience in an interview with Fox News Digital, repeating the team’s mission statement which was to ""get to Hawaii as fast as possible.""

SHARK QUIZ! HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW YOUR SHARKS THIS SUMMER?

""So that’s what we did,"" she said.

The rower revealed how breaking the record was, at times, questionable.

She admitted that her confidence in expecting to break the record might have been ""naïve,"" given that conditions on the water were so unpredictable.

""The last couple of days we had really terrible conditions and our expected time of arrival just kept getting pushed back later and later,"" she said.

The team left San Francisco on June 21 — and arrived in Waikiki on Monday, July 25.

""But the last day, we knew that we were going to break a world record. It just came down to a matter of by how much.""

The team left San Francisco on June 21 — and arrived in Waikiki on Monday, July 25.

Besides hitting rocky waters at the tail end of the voyage, Downes remembered moving ""terribly slow"" about two weeks into the race due to the wind conditions.

This slow movement lasted for about five days in intense heat.

""That was kind of a point where, for me, I saw the opportunity to break the overall record kind of go away, which was just really disappointing,"" she said.

""Seeing how defeated our whole team was — was just pretty heartbreaking.""

But the strength of the foursome kept the boat moving along as the women lifted each other up and laughed through the challenging tides.

""Out there in the middle of the ocean, we had so much fun,"" she said.

""More fun than I could have ever expected to have.""

""There was one day that the conditions were perfect for us to jump in the water and swim,"" she added.

""That was a really special day for us to all be together, swimming in this spot off land [where] probably no other human has ever been.""

HOW TO EXERCISE DURING A WORK TRIP AND STAY FIT WHILE TRAVELING

Downes expressed feeling ""grateful"" for her teammates’ support on nights when conditions were rough and sometimes outright painful physically.

Each teammate rowed for two hours on and two hours off to balance adequate sleep — and to allow the team members to manage other tasks, such as preparing freeze-dried meals and handling boat maintenance.

The crew made 25 liters of purified water per day, through a pressurized system and solar energy — which they used to drink, cook, rinse off and clean their clothes.

""Every single day brings something new,"" she said.

""But the schedule is exactly the same the entire time.""

Each woman only brought along enough clothes to satisfy every weather condition, including rain, intense heat and even cold weather.

The cabins on the front and back ends of the boat slept two rowers each, which was a tight squeeze for Downes, who measures 5’11"" in height.

""It’s pretty amazing how much you can fit in the boat,"" she said. ""But you didn't bring anything that you didn't need.""

Downes detailed how each woman only brought enough clothes to satisfy every weather condition, including rain, intense heat and even cold weather.

""The beginning was very cold,"" she said.

""And extra-cold because we would have to put on the same wet clothes to row.""

The women encountered other obstacles on the water, such as being hit by flying fish. Also, the boat’s rudder was knocked out of place by an unidentified marine animal — sending the boat spinning.

The boat’s bearings also began to corrode halfway through the journey. That was caused by different metals being mixed into the wheels.

""We made it to the finish line with no spare wheels,"" she said.

It took about a day and a half after the women first spotted Hawaii’s mountainous landscape to officially reach land.

New Jersey-born Downes, who graduated from the University of Southern California in 2019, described the journey as ""the best decision"" she’s ever made as a rower of more than 10 years.

""I was really curious,"" she said.

""I wanted to know what it was like to be out in the middle of the ocean with nobody around … during this huge, incredible race.""

""I love rowing, and I want to row even more now.""

The rower said there was ""nothing stopping"" her except fear, so teammate Libby Costello — a longtime friend of Downes — invited her to join the Lat 35 crew.

Downes accepted the offer, quit her job and moved to Santa Barbara to begin training.

REMOTE WORK IS CHANGING TRAVEL — HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

""I thought, I can either watch that whole experience and wish that I was doing it with her — or I can actually do it with her,"" she said.

""And it was the best decision I’ve made.""

Downes, who was training for the National Rowing Team prior to the race, is aspiring to qualify for the Olympics in 2024, but said she’ll be taking some time to recuperate first.

""I love rowing, and I want to row even more now,"" she said.

Denison-Johnston is also an Olympic hopeful.

Downes is currently enjoying her time in Hawaii.

The record for fastest male rowers was also broken by a Lat 35 team during the 2021 race.

The men completed the race in 30 days, five hours and 37 minutes.

With a fleet of five Wyoming food trucks, Double Dubs founder Trent Weitzel has big ambitions.

He announced on Friday, in honor of National Chicken Wing Day, that he will attempt to set a Guinness World Record next July by selling 55,000 wings in a single day at Cheyenne Frontier Days.

Earlier this year, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., one of seven Democrats serving on the nine-member January 6 committee panel, said Trump tried to ""weaponize"" the DOJ in an attempt ""to retain power.""

""Today @January6thCmte will expose how Donald Trump tried to weaponize the Department of Justice in his desperate bid to retain power,"" Raskin wrote. ""Watch at 3pm ET as witnesses, including the former Acting Attorney General, reveal how Trump nearly made the Big Lie DOJ policy.""

Despite the Trump-era accusations made by the House Democrats, the party, overall, is now silent or lauding the Justice Department after Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida was raided by FBI agents on Monday.

Pelosi said Tuesday she believed the FBI must have ""justification"" for the raid.

""All I know about that is what is in the public domain. I was surprised that it flashed on my phone last evening, so I don't really have too much to say except that to have a visit like that, you need a warrant. To have a warrant, you need justification. And that says that no one is above the law, not even a president or a former president of the United States,"" Pelosi told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

Raskin, during an appearance on MSNBC, also responded briefly to the raid at Mar-a-Lago, insisting that Americans have an ""interest"" in the rule of law.

""The great thing about the separation of powers is we knew nothing about that,"" Raskin said. ""We don't know whether that's something related to what we're working on or not...""

""Everybody in America, and speaking as a citizen, we all have an interest in the rule of law in the country and respect for the rule of law, and resistance to the lawlessness that seems to be always out there,"" he added.

In a tweet issued Monday after the raid was made public, Jayapal sang a different tune as she claimed the FBI is taking steps toward ""accountability"" and suggested that Trump should be in prison.

""That’s what happens when you break the law, try to steal an election, and incite a deadly insurrection,"" she wrote. ""Donald Trump should be in jail. I’m glad to see the FBI taking steps towards accountability.""

Multiple sources tell Fox News the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago is related to the materials Trump allegedly brought to his private residence after his presidency concluded. That matter was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority.

Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., said the unprecedented FBI raid at former President Donald Trump’s residence at Mar-a-Lago is not the first ""October surprise"" carried out by the agency on behalf of Democrats, noting the timing of the arrests in the alleged kidnapping plot targeting Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

""The same FBI that cooked up a plot to kidnap governors before an election just raided Biden’s most likely challenger,"" Bishop tweeted on Monday evening amid breaking news of the Mar-a-Lago raid. ""Democrats are cheering on the weaponization of law enforcement against political opponents. They don’t care about ‘democracy’: just crushing their enemies.""

Bishop joined other GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee in demanding U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray urgently testify regarding the Trump raid.

In a follow-up tweet on Tuesday, Bishop noted that jury selection has begun in the re-trial of two of the four men charged in federal court in connection to an alleged kidnapping plot targeting Whitmer in October 2020 allegedly over disgust with the Democrat’s lockdown restrictions.

TRUMP FBI RAID: HILLARY CLINTON APPEARS TO FUNDRAISE OFF MAR-A-LAGO SEARCH

In April, a federal jury could not reach a verdict for Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr., but two other co-defendants, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta, were found not guilty and acquitted on all charges.

Defense attorneys had accused the FBI of entrapment, painting their clients of marijuana-smoking weekend warriors, rather than domestic extremists weeded out by an FBI informant.

""As the retrial begins for 2 of the accused in the FBI Whitmer plot, remember: Arrests were announced on Oct. 8th, 2020, during early voting. A perfect October surprise,"" Bishop tweeted Tuesday. ""If you're still inclined to give the FBI the benefit of the doubt here, think again.""

Bishop shared a link to a story by The Wall Street Journal outlining how the two acquitted men in the alleged Whitmer kidnapping plot could pose an uphill battle for prosecutors during the retrial, noting how a former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan admitted that the ""big question is, did the FBI arrest these defendants too quickly, before they gathered enough evidence.""

Bishop wrote about the case in a recent op-ed for North State Journal. The congressman pointed out how during a recent hearing hosted by the House Judiciary Committee, he questioned Matthew Olsen, assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice’s National Security Division.

""I questioned Mr. Olsen about a disturbing trend emerging in the DOJ’s efforts to detect and thwart domestic terrorism plots. Specifically, weeks before the 2020 election, the FBI announced it had foiled an alleged plot to kidnap the Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer.

""It is clear from the current evidence that federal agents cooked up this operation, trained recruits to carry out the FBI’s plan, directed recruitment efforts, and incentivized the informants with handsome paydays in order to keep the plot moving forward – all on the taxpayers’ dime,"" Bishop wrote.

Former Vice President Mike Pence demanded that the ""appearance of continued partisanship"" by the Justice Department be addressed after the ""unprecedented"" raid on former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home.

""I share the deep concern of millions of Americans over the unprecedented search of the personal residence of President Trump,"" Pence tweeted Tuesday. ""No former President of the United States has ever been subject to a raid of their personal residence in American history.""

""After years where FBI agents were found to be acting on political motivation during our administration, the appearance of continued partisanship by the Justice Department must be addressed,"" Pence said, adding that the raid ""undermines public confidence in our system of justice.""

Pence's statement emerged only after many other Republicans had commented before him, despite the close relationship Pence says he had with Trump in the White House.

Senior Senate Republicans, who have themselves reacted only gradually, Tuesday demanded that the FBI immediately release information about its raid of former President Trump's Florida estate, which they are calling a major law enforcement escalation against a former president.

The statements, from GOP Conference Chair John Barrasso, R-Wyo., Vice Conference Chair Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Rick Scott, R-Fla., come as top Senate Republicans overall have been slower to comment on the raid than their counterparts in House GOP leadership.

Pence added: ""Attorney General Garland must give a full accounting to the American people as to why this action was taken and he must do so immediately.""

Vermont voters will choose candidates Tuesday to fill a seat in the U.S. Senate that has been occupied since 1975 by retiring Democratic U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the last of Congress's so-called Watergate babies, elected after the resignation of former President Richard Nixon.

The leading Democratic candidate to run for Leahy's seat in the November election is U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, a liberal Democrat known for working across the aisle. Welch has held his House seat since 2007. During the years he has been in Congress, Welch has been one of Vermont's top vote getters and would be an odds-on favorite to win the general election.

Vermont's former U.S. Attorney Christina Nolan and retired U.S. Army officer Gerald Malloy are the two leading candidates vying for the Republican Party nomination for the November election.

Both Nolan and Malloy believe they can win the seat. Vermont is considered by many to be one of the most liberal states in country. No Republican has represented the state in Washington since 2001 when the late Sen. Jim Jeffords left the GOP to become an independent, switching control of the Senate from Republican to Democratic.

The two leading GOP candidates for the U.S. House nomination are Ericka Redic, of Burlington, and Liam Madden, a Marine Corps veteran from Bellows Falls.

Redic says that if elected she would focus on fighting inflation, illegal immigration, drug misuse and government overreach, particularly as it concerns vaccine mandates.

Madden, a non-traditional candidate in the Republican primary, says he's an independent. He said he had thought of declining the nomination if he wins, until he learned that would allow the party to choose a replacement for the November ballot.

The Vermont primary will also choose the nominees for governor.

There is simply no question, by any objective standard, that Joe Biden is on a hot streak.

After many months of muddled messaging and plummeting polls, the president has pushed through a raft of important legislation, culminating with a sweeping climate change/health care/corporate taxes measure that will win final approval this week. Some of the bills passed with strong bipartisan support. And it’s been just over a week since the president announced that on his orders, a drone strike had killed the leader of al Qaeda.

But all this may have little impact on Biden’s attempt to rally his party behind him in seeking a second term. The media narrative against him – that he’s too old, too slow, and that most Democrats want a younger candidate – could be too powerful to alter, baked into the midterm cake.

That may be unfair to Biden, who now has a stronger slate of legislative accomplishments than any president in decades, but life is unfair. He would be 82 at the next inauguration and too many of his voters – along with Democratic lawmakers – seem ready to give him a gold watch and a hearty sendoff.

BEHIND THE KANSAS ABORTION SHOCKER : WHY SOME RED STATES DON'T WANT A TOTAL BAN

Imagine a football team that goes 2-7, with growing calls to fire the coach, and then wins its last 7 games to pull out a winning record. Does the strong finish erase the memory of its earlier awfulness?

Keep in mind that journalists worship polls. If Biden were suddenly to get a healthy bump, the media would start doing pieces about his comeback, easing fears among fellow Democrats that he will drag his party down in 2022 and be a weak candidate two years later. But without that short-term pop, the conventional wisdom remains that inflation (though Biden has brought down gas prices somewhat) will drive a sweeping Republican victory in November.

And then there’s the nature of the climate legislation itself, the dubiously named Inflation Reduction Act. Even Bernie Sanders says it will have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation.

The truth is it will take a while for ordinary folks to feel the effects of the $700-billion bill, and elections are won or lost in the short term.

The measure provides the greatest investment in climate change by a single country, but global warming won’t ease for years, and even the clean-energy funds will have to be awarded and workers hired before anyone’s life is improved.

As the Washington Post points out, the $7,500 credits for buying electric cars only happen if manufacturers displace Chinese batteries by 2024.

Allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices is a long-sought goal, but that will also take some time. The $300 billion in deficit reduction is an important step, but for most Americans the deficit is an abstraction.

Meanwhile, some liberal Democrats can barely hide their dissatisfaction with Biden. In the case of two veteran House members running against each other in a New York district, Jerry Nadler said it’s too early to talk about 2024 and Carolyn Maloney said she doesn’t think Biden’s running (and then apologized by saying she’ll back him if he does but still doesn’t think he will). That is hardly the mark of a strong incumbent.

Rather than trying to hector him out of the race, Maureen Dowd used her New York Times column to appeal to Biden’s sense of history: ""He could leave on a high, knowing that he has delivered on his promises for progress and restored decency to the White House.""

Biden wasted months fighting for on a left-wing fantasy bill whose absurd price tag – $3.5 trillion – meant it would never come close to passing a 50-50 Senate. And while Republicans spent many hours trashing the new bill that they can’t stop because of reconciliation – just as Democrats did with the Trump tax cuts – it’s a far more moderate measure than would spend less than a quarter of the original measure.

Maybe this gives Biden a more solid platform to sell himself as worthy of four more years. But for now there’s a profound disconnect between Biden and his voters on whether the man who first ran for president in 1987 should make one last run."

What happened in Kansas is what the Supreme Court, and defenders of its abortion ruling, say they wanted.

Not the outcome, to be sure: A stunning surge of voters who supported keeping the right to abortion in the state constitution, just a point below the level considered a landslide victory.

But the whole rationale for overturning Roe v. Wade was to take such decisions out of the hands of unelected judges and put them closer to the people, on a state by state basis. Well, in Kansas, a conservative state where Republicans far outnumber Democrats, the people have spoken, with a 59 to 41% declaration.

Now those who are passionately pro-life will keep on fighting, as they have every right to do, just as pro-choicers wouldn’t have given up if they had gotten beaten. This is just one round in the Kansas battle.

HOW POWERHOUSE PERSONALITTIES DRIVE EVERYONE CRAZY - AND OFTEN CHANGE HISTORY

But it serves as a national warning that complete bans on abortion, while inevitable in some red states, are not so easily accomplished. And many Republican lawmakers must have woken up yesterday and wondered whether they need to compromise.

It’s no coincidence that some conservative Republican governors haven’t seized this moment to make abortion totally illegal in their states. Ron DeSantis, who obviously has 2024 ambitions, is sticking with his past position of no abortions after 15 weeks – which might have seemed dramatic a few months ago but is now a middle ground, perhaps better suited to Florida and a White House campaign.

What is fueling the abortion rights side, in my view, is extensive media coverage of the lack of exceptions proposed in some state bans. The Idaho GOP has endorsed the idea of not allowing abortions even if the mother’s life is in danger. And stories about women with serious miscarriages being allowed to bleed for days because the treatment is the same as an abortion haven’t exactly projected an image of compassion.

The rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl who went to Indiana for an abortion, once it was confirmed, provides a graphic case for those who say it is cruel and heartless to force victims to give birth to their rapist’s babies.

Tudor Dixon, who won the GOP nomination for Michigan governor on Tuesday, described a hypothetical 14-year-old girl who is sexually assaulted by her uncle as a ""perfect example"" of someone who should be forced to give birth. Asked if she wanted to soften her remarks, Dixon said, ""I’m not hiding from it.""

These legal battles will play out in all 50 states, and now the Justice Department has joined the fray. DOJ sued over the new Idaho law, saying it violates a federal requirement (for hospitals accepting Medicare) that medical care must be provided when a pregnant woman’s life or health is at stake. Merrick Garland said ""we will use every tool at our disposal"" to ensure such treatment.

President Biden signed an executive order yesterday aiming to protect women who travel out of state for abortions, but its weak language only directs HHS to ""consider"" such action. The travel question is certain to be another front in this legal war.

In Kansas, advocacy groups poured millions into advertising campaigns, with the Catholic Church and other religious groups weighing in on one side and national abortion rights groups on the other.

Turns out the pro-choice side won counties where Donald Trump won big victories last time, making clear there were plenty of Republicans who at least favored allowing abortions with some restrictions.

BIDEN TAKES OUT AL QAEDA LEADER OVER 9/11 ATTACKS, DRAWS (MOSTLY) MEDIA PRAISE

But that will be up to state legislators, who can still impose a total or near-total ban on abortions.

The flashing neon light across the country, though, is that cracking down on abortions is far more complicated than a simple yes or no.

It was, no question, a victory for America and the world.

The drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahri, the leader of al Qaeda, took out one of the world’s most despicable terrorists, the intellectual force behind the group who, as Usama bin Laden’s number two, helped mastermind the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. And Zawahri pulled off devastating attacks before that, including the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, which prompted the Clinton administration to target him.

It was also a big win for President Biden, and yet no one felt more of a sense of closure than the families of the 9/11 victims. Zawahri was a central plotter for the hijacked airplanes that toppled the World Trade Center, slammed into the Pentagon, and would have struck a third target if not for the bravery of passengers above Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

That utterly transformed our politics for years, plunging us into an age of not bringing liquids on airplanes, passing homeland security laws and waging a 20-year war in Afghanistan.

HOW POWERHOUSE PERSONALITTIES DRIVE EVERYONE CRAZY - AND OFTEN CHANGE HISTORY

This was not a military operation of the kind that killed Usama bin Laden in 2011, with Biden sitting in the famous Situation Room photo as he, President Obama and other leaders waited for the results of the Navy SEAL raid. While officials aren’t saying this publicly, it was a CIA counterterrorism operation. It took another 11 years for Biden to authorize the strike that killed Zawahri on Saturday.

Zawahri’s gray-bearded visage had become familiar to Americans when he took over al Qaeda and made a series of videos to deliver terror messages. It’s true he was past his prime, but this was about accountability.

TRUMP AGAIN DOMINATING THE NEWS, BIDEN'S BLISTERING SPEECH A SIDEBAR

From a White House balcony, where he is still sidelined by COVID-19, Biden told the country: ""Justice has been delivered, and this terrorist leader is no more… We make it clear again tonight that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out.""

Biden deserves credit for the tough call, as some Republicans acknowledged, but this is not going to transform the midterms. It will soon fade from the news with voters remaining focused on inflation, COVID-19 and other domestic issues. Even Obama only got a short-term bump for taking out bin Laden.

Now we come to a more complicated question.

Biden has a strong argument that his approach has been vindicated after he presided over the worst foreign policy debacle in generations, the violent and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. The president said then that the U.S. could conduct counterterrorism missions even without boots on the ground – and the CIA operation proved him right, with reports of no civilian casualties.

But Republicans are taking some shots over the fact that Zawarhi was in Kabul at all. Under the withdrawal deal – negotiated by Donald Trump in 2020, and later accepted by Biden – the Taliban pledged not to harbor any terror organization with international aims.

Is anyone really shocked that the Taliban, which claim to have had no idea of Zawarhi’s presence, are lying? He lived in a luxurious home in a wealthy gated community in the capital, not far from the U.S. Embassy. He returned after the Taliban takeover, let down his guard, and it took our intelligence service months to confirm his presence and his practice of spending time on his balcony, the spot where he was killed – after his family moved to another Kabul home.

Can anyone really doubt that the Taliban regime, which has also flouted its promises on human rights, is shielding other al Qaeda terrorists as well?

Some conservatives are ripping Biden for claiming al Qaeda’s presence had vanished. But the Taliban takeover clearly changed things.

That’s American politics. But the larger point – that the last remaining 9/11 plotter has been held accountable for his heinous crimes – is what history will remember."

Media commentators ranging from Donald Trump's strongest foes to most fervent allies appeared in agreement on one thing Monday: the FBI raid of his Mar-a-Lago home may have handed him the 2024 Republican nomination.

The FBI executed a search warrant of the former president's Florida residence on Monday, stunning the news industry and incensing Trump and his supporters. Sources told Fox News Digital the search was in connection with materials that Trump took with him from his time as president. Sources also said National Archives and Records Administration referred the case to the Justice Department, which recovered 15 boxes of classified materials from the home.

CNN commentator Alyssa Farah Griffin, who served as Trump's White House communications director but is now one of his fiercest critics, fretted on ""New Day"" that an empty-handed raid could send Trump to the White House.

""This, I'm hoping, goes beyond simply not complying with some archiving laws, or [the Department of Justice] just handed Donald Trump the Republican [nomination] and potentially the presidency,"" she said. ""If it's seen as some sort of massive overreach and not something incredibly serious, this is a very good day for Donald Trump.""

NANCY PELOSI REACTS TO FBI RAID ON TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RESORT, SAYS AUTHORITIES HAD 'JUSTIFICATION'

Joe Walsh, the ex-GOP congressman who like Farah Griffin evolved from a passionate Trump fan to one of his sharpest media foes, also expressed concern the search of the former president's home may rally his supporters behind the flag.

""Both things are true: 1. The Justice Department’s job is to pursue justice & uphold the rule of law. And they should NEVER let politics get in the way of that. Yesterday, they did their job. 2. What happened yesterday handed the 2024 GOP nomination to Donald Trump,"" he tweeted.

Trump has essentially frozen the 2024 GOP field as he gives hints that he will make a third run for the White House without formally announcing yet. His dramatic statement about the raid said his home had been ""occupied,"" ""raided,"" and was ""under siege"" by the FBI, and it received a strong reaction from his backers.

CNN's Dana Bash said Trump had greatly advanced his short-term political goal of capturing the nomination, saying his language in the statement about the raid was ""kind of genius.""

""It totally triggers and animates the people not only who like him, but there was concern, according to people around Trump, that he had, that he was losing some mojo. He was having some trouble raising money. And this, he believes, would turn it around,"" she said.

2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who has since formed the new Forward Party, worried that the raid would contribute to the depiction of Trump ""against a corrupt government establishment. The raid strengthens that case for millions of Americans who will see this as unjust persecution.""

""Trump is winning the FBI-raid caucus going away—we’ll learn more, but this is his best day in pursuit of the 2024 nomination in a long time,"" National Review's Rich Lowry tweeted.

""Was the FBI's Raid on Mar-a-Lago the Biggest In-Kind Contribution to Trump's 2024 Bid?"" a Townhall column by Matt Vespa asked, while HotAir's Ed Morrissey asked, ""Are they trying to hand Donald Trump the nomination in 2024?""

Others suggested the raid had only clinched his desire to seek the White House again.

Even straight news outlets framed the story as a potential boon to Trump's White House run, which he's hinted at for months.

""Donald Trump has given every signal that he’s running for president in 2024. The FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida on Monday may only harden his resolve to jump in the race — and possibly speed up the timetable,"" NBC News reported.

FBI RAIDS TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO: 'UNPRECEDENTED' FOR AGENCY TO EXECUTE SEARCH WARRANT AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT

The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires presidential administrations to preserve certain documents.

Under the law, all White House staff must copy or forward any presidential records created on non-official electronic messaging accounts to their official electronic messaging account within 20 days of leaving office.

According to a 2017 memorandum issued by the White House counsel's office under the Trump administration, ""any employee who intentionally fails to take these actions may be subject to administrative or even criminal penalties.""

Trump, earlier this year, said the National Archives didn’t ""find"" the documents, but that they were ""given, upon request.""

""The National Archives did not ‘find’ anything, they were given, upon request, Presidential Records in an ordinary and routine process to ensure the preservation of my legacy and in accordance with the Presidential Records Act,"" Trump said in a statement at the time, adding that Democrats ""are in search of their next Scam.""

The matter was referred to the Justice Department by NARA.

Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA 'UNDER SIEGE' BY FBI AGENTS

The FBI’s raid of Mar-a-Lago took place early Monday morning, when Trump was in New York City.

An FBI source confirmed that FBI agents from Washington, D.C., who are on the bureau's Evidence Response Team, conducted the raid and notified the Miami Field Office just before.

Per standard protocol, FBI Director Chris Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland were aware of the raid even if shortly before and would have been fully briefed.

A White House official told Fox News it did not have any notice of the reported action and referred all additional questions to the DOJ.

A source familiar told Fox News that agents brought a ""safe cracker"" and cracked a ""relatively new"" safe in Mar-a-Lago. The source told Fox News there was ""nothing in it.""

A source familiar told Fox News that FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago and looked in every single office and safe, and grabbed documents and boxes without going through them on the property. They took boxes and documents to go through them later.

""They were not being judicious about what they took,"" the source told Fox News.

GOP SLAMS 'WEAPONIZATION' OF DOJ AFTER TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RAIDED BY FBI; DEMS CALL IT 'ACCOUNTABILITY'

Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz said FBI agents likely seized documents without inquiring if they were classified, declassified or personal to Trump.

""The Justice Department had no right to seize them indiscriminately because some may not be classified and others may be classified above their level,"" he said. ""There are things that have been declassified by the president, which the Justice Department doesn't know about.""

Dershowitz slammed the unprecedented raid of the former president’s home, and questioned the bureau’s decision to execute a search warrant, rather than issue a subpoena for the records in question.

""There was no reason not to issue a subpoena returnable tomorrow, so that there's no claim that Trump could've destroyed anything,"" Dershowitz told Fox News. ""This should've been a subpoena, not a search warrant.""

He added: ""If it is a search warrant, it has to have a high level of cause demonstrating that the evidence would have been destroyed.""

Legal scholars note that when individuals previously violated the law regarding classified documents, the Justice Department has opted to either not prosecute or settle for lesser charges.

""The Presidential Records Act is not commonly a subject of criminal prosecution, even in the most egregious cases,"" said Jonathan Turley, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. ""These incidents have generally been handled administratively.""

Trump made the raid public Monday evening, saying in a lengthy statement that ""nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.""

""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said. ""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections.""

""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before,"" Trump said.

""What is the difference between this and Watergate, where operatives broke into the Democrat National Committee?"" he continued. ""Here, in reverse, Democrats broke into the home of the 45th President of the United States."""

Senior correspondent Laura Ingle hosts this multi-part Fox Nation Audio podcast that examines the unsolved murder mystery of the more than ten people, many of them sex workers, found on Long Island.

On a December morning more than a decade ago, a police dog stumbled across a set of female human remains on the south shore of Long Island, New York, along the edge of Ocean Parkway in Gilgo Beach. Law enforcement soon discovered the remains of three more women, stuffed in burlap bags found in thick bramble off a stretch of highway.

Months later, the body of 24-year-old sex worker Shannan Gilbert was also discovered near Oak Beach, not far from the “Gilgo Four,”. Also found were the dismembered remains of other women, a man dressed in female clothing, and a toddler, scattered in various locations throughout Long Island. Investigators announced that a serial killer (or killers) was to blame for the murders. But to this day, no suspects have been publicly named and no arrests have been made in a case that shook a quiet, sleepy beach town to its core, and captivated the nation.

In this Fox Nation series/Fox Audio podcast, produced by Fox News’ Investigative Unit, find out what law enforcement is currently doing to solve the case using new technology. You’ll learn new details from a former escort who believes she spoke with the Long Island serial killer. And hear from an investigator who helped solve the Golden State Killer case and what he believes can be done to lead to capture of the killer."

Why? Well it’s not hard to figure out. Law enforcement has never been an easy job but when you take that, add the defund and demonize movement, plus felon coddling policies like so-called “bail reform” and mix in Democrat politicians who have turned their backs on officers, this is what you get.

So now what? The already increasingly dangerous, violent and lawless streets get worse.

Policing isn’t a job, it’s a calling but with few incentives left, we can’t be surprised that fewer brave men and women are willing to answer the call.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, I am a proud Trump supporter BUT I would like to see DeSantis as our ’24 nominee.

A pivotal showdown for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in battleground Wiscons takes center stage on Tuesday, as four states from New England to the upper Midwest hold primaries.

The fight for Wisconsin’s GOP gubernatorial nomination between former conservative Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and businessman Tim Michels is the latest test of GOP clout between former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence, one-time running mates who could potentially face-off against each other for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

Kleefisch and MIchels are the front-runners in a field of four Republican candidates that also includes state lawmaker Timothy Ramthun. The GOP primary winner will face off in November with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who faces no primary challenge but who’s being heavily targeted by Republicans as he seeks a second term.

Michels is a multimillionaire owner of a construction company who in early June was endorsed by Trump. Two weeks ago, Pence once again broke with his former boss as he backed Kleefisch.

KLEEFISCH LANDS ANOTHER HIGH PROFILE CONSERVATIVE ENDORSEMENT

""There is no candidate for governor in America that is more capable, more experienced or a more proven conservative than Rebecca Kleefisch,"" Pence said as he teamed up with the former lieutenant governor at a campaign stop in suburban Milwaukee on Wednesday.

And Kleefisch touted that she's ""tested and proven and ready to go,"" and that she's ""the one who has won statewide four times.""

Two days later, as he headlined a rally for Michels in Waukesha, Trump charged that ""Rebecca Kleefisch does not have what it takes to beat Tony Evers… He's going to win if he runs against Rebecca.""

AFTER SNUB FROM TRUMP, KLEEFISCH VOWS SHE'LL WIN WISCONSIN'S GOP GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY

Asked by reporters on the eve of the primary for comments Trump’s derogatory attacks, Kleefisch responded: ""No thoughts that I can share.""

And she seemed to discount Trump’s endorsement of Michels as she emphasized in a Fox News interview on Monday that ""the voters of Wisconsin are going to be the ones who determine the outcome of this race.""

Michels’ campaign attempted to frame Kleefisch as a never Trumper, writing in an email to supporters on primary eve that ""if we don’t get Trump supporters to the polls to vote for Tim Michels on Tuesday, the Never Trumpers will win."" And Michel’s campaign argued that if Kleefisch wins, ""the media will falsely report Wisconsinites have rejected Trump’s endorsement.""

Michels has also spent big bucks to run ads targeting Kleefisch, while the former lieutenant governor has criticized Michels - who owns a home in Connecticut - as a part-time Wisconsin resident.

HEAD TO THE FOX NEWS ELECTIONS CENTER FOR THE LATEST PRIMARY RESULTS

The candidate Trump backed in last week’s GOP gubernatorial primary in Arizona, former TV news anchor Kari Lake, narrowly edged real estate developer and Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson, who was supported by Pence.

But in May, conservative Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, who was endorsed by Pence, trounced his Trump-backed challenger, former Sen. David Perdue, in the state’s GOP gubernatorial primary.

Besides Pence, two other potential 2024 GOP White House hopefuls, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former South Carolina governor and former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, endorsed Kleefisch this summer. Haley campaigned with the former lieutenant governor and helped her raise roughly $100,000.

In Wisconsin’s high profile Senate race — one of a handful across the country that will likely determine if the Republicans win back the chamber’s majority in November — GOP Sen. Ron Johnson is being heavily targeted by Democrats. Johnson faces a lone long-shot primary challenge on Tuesday from educator David Schroeder

Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes is his party’s all-but-certain Senate nominee on Tuesday, after his leading rivals dropped out of the race in recent weeks and endorsed him. Barnes is also backed by national progressive champions such as Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Barnes is part of a primary field that also includes four lesser-known Democrats.

President Biden narrowly carried Wisconsin as he won the 2020 election, and on Friday at his rally, Trump blasted Republican state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos for not embracing his unproven claims that his 2020 loss to Biden was due to massive voter fraud.

While Vos — who’s the state’s longest serving Assembly speaker — launched a controversial investigation into the 2020 election in Wisconsin and took a lead in passing a series of bills that tightened voting access in the state, he’s resisted Trump’s repeated calls to try and decertify the 2020 election results.

Minnesota

Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota faces a long shot primary challenge as he seeks a second term. Three Republicans are running in their party’s primary, including doctor and former state Sen. Scott Jenson, who landed the state GOP’s endorsement.

There's a special election on Tuesday in the state's primarily rural 1st Congressional District, along the state's southern border with Iowa, to fill the seat left vacant after GOP Rep. Jim Hagedorn died of cancer in February. The winner will serve the remainder of Hagedorn's term through the end of the year.

But complicating matters is that this isn't the only election in the district. There's also the reguarly scheduled primary

In the state’s Minneapolis-centric 5th Congressional District, progressive first-term Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, a member of the ""Squad,"" is facing four primary challengers. One of them — former Minneapolis City Councilman Don Samuels — is endorsed by a handful of former Minnesota mayors and has spotlighted his law enforcement support while criticizing Omar for pushing to dismantle the city’s police department.

In Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District, in the Twin Cities southern suburbs, all eyes are on November’s general election, when Democratic incumbent Rep. Angie Craig and 2020 GOP nominee Tyler Kistner will face off in a rematch.

Connecticut

Three Republicans are running in Tuesday’s Senate GOP primary in Connecticut, with the winner facing off in November against Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal. They are former state House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, businesswoman Leora Levy and businessman Peter Lumai.

""This is a very big deal. The act isn’t, by itself, enough to avert climate disaster. But it’s a huge step in the right direction, and sets the stage for more action in the years ahead,"" Krugman wrote, in a piece headlined, ""Did Democrats Just Save Civilization?""

Multiple White House staffers and Democrats have taken to social media attempting to rebrand President Biden as ""dark Brandon"" amid a series of legislative victories.

""Dark Brandon is crushing it,"" Andrew Bates, the White House deputy press secretary, tweeted Sunday evening along with an image of Biden with laser eyes.

""Your malarkey has been going on for long enough, kiddo,"" read the image's caption.

Bates then tweeted another meme with the captions ""the malarkey will end"" and ""the dark Brandon rises"" in response to a tweet criticizing his initial post. The image appeared to depict Biden as Batman.

REPUBLICANS SAY DEMOCRATS WILL ‘PAY THE PRICE’ IN MIDTERMS FOR PASSING MASSIVE SPENDING BILL

But conservatives pointed out that the second image tweeted by Bates included eagle imagery resembling the logo used by the Nazi Party in the 1930s.

""Personally, I'm not surprised that you're tweeting out Nazi eagle imagery of your boss who reminisces about his segregationist 'mentor,'"" Abigail Marone, a spokesperson for Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., tweeted.

""'Dark Brandon' started as Chinese propaganda and then the White House co-opted it using Nazi Eagle imagery..."" Alec Sears, a digital staffer at the Republican National Committee, tweeted. ""They're not sending their best.""

""In 2020, the Trump campaign faced a week of stories and fact checks about a t-shirt with an eagle on it,"" Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for former President Trump's 2020 campaign, tweeted. ""Let’s see if a tweet from an official Biden White House account gets the same treatment.""

However, the apparent creator of the image said Monday that the image was never intended to be the ""Reichsadler"" seen in Nazi imagery, in an interview with The Washington Post. He said it was instead meant to represent a bald eagle.

The White House suggested the Nazi imagery allegation originated from Jack Posobiec, a conservative commentator linked to conspiracy theories.

""Who could have guessed that some Pizzagate/QAnon guy lies?"" Bates told Fox News Digital in an email. ""Have y’all seen this, though?""

Bates then pointed to a tweet Monday containing allegations from Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that former President Trump insisted U.S. generals be more like ""German generals in World War II.""

The ""Dark Brandon"" moniker appears to have started on Twitter in March among anonymous Biden supporters seeking to create an ""edgy"" version of the president, according to an online meme database. The meme also seeks to co-opt the ""let's go Brandon"" meme that originated among conservatives online and has become popular for those that oppose the Biden administration's agenda.

In addition, Rob Flaherty, the White House director of digital strategy, tweeted an image of Biden with laser eyes. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., also appeared to parrot the ""dark Brandon"" meme, posting an animation of Biden without pupils without a caption Sunday.

Megan Apper, who left the White House earlier this year to join the State Department, joined in on the ""Dark Brandon"" tweets, tweeting, ""Dark Brandon said ‘here’s the deal’ and then there was a deal.""

The apparent rebranding of Biden comes after several victories Democrats said showed the president has been successful overcoming gridlock on Capitol Hill.

In June, Biden signed a gun control bill that incentivizes states to approve red flag laws and introduce increased background checks, and last week, Biden signed the $280 billion Chips and Science Act, which boosts funding for the domestic semiconductor supply chain.

And, on Sunday, the Senate approved the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping budget reconciliation package that would introduce new green energy incentives and attempt to lower pharmaceutical prices.

""For decades, the gun lobby and the oil companies and the drug industry controlled Washington. And ordinary people suffered,"" Murphy tweeted. ""And [sic] then, in one summer, all that changed. The first gun safety bill in 30 years. Historic climate change legislation. Caps on drug costs. Just wow.""

However, conservatives were quick to criticize Democrats claiming victory and rebranding Biden as ""dark Brandon.""

""You can try to Dark Brandon meme your way out of sub-40 approval ratings all you want, but throwing hundreds of billions at green boondoggles in the middle of an inflationary spiral isn't going to turn things around,"" conservative commentator Ben Shapiro tweeted Monday.

The traveling nurse from Texas charged over a fiery car crash in a Los Angeles neighborhood that left six people dead, including a pregnant mother on the way to a prenatal checkup and a baby, was involved in more than a dozen prior wrecks, according to prosecutors.

Nicole Linton, 37, of Houston, was charged on Monday with six counts of murder and five counts of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence.

The announcement came after she allegedly barreled a Mercedes down La Brea Avenue on Aug. 4 at high speeds before running a red light and crashing into several vehicles in the Windsor Hills neighborhood, igniting a fiery wreck seen on surveillance cameras.

Prosecutors alleged that Linton had been involved in 13 car crashes — both in and out of the state of California — before Thursday’s wreck, the Los Angeles Times reported. They noted one in 2020 involved bodily injury and two cars being totaled but did not elaborate with more information.

Linton’s attorney, Halim Dhanidina, requested that the arraignment be continued until October to allow time to review the nurse’s out-of-state history of ""documented profound mental health issues,"" according to the Times.

Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón said Monday that so far evidence does not suggest Linton was under the influence of alcohol but investigations into the cause of the crash remain active.

Those killed included 23-year-old Asherey Ryan, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant, her 11-month-old son and Ryan’s boyfriend. Two other women, who have yet to be identified, in another vehicle also were killed. Six other vehicles were involved in the collision, including five people with minor injuries in an SUV and another driver in another vehicle, according to prosecutors. The case remains under investigation by the California Highway Patrol.

""Today, we begin the process of holding accountable the person responsible for the deaths of six people, including a pregnant woman, and their families,"" Gascón said in a statement. ""This is a case that will always be remembered for the senseless loss of so many innocent lives as they simply went about their daily routines. I want to thank our prosecutors and the investigating officers at the California Highway Patrol for their work on this case.""

""While the wreckage of this fiery crash at this intersection was removed and traffic eventually resumed, there is catastrophic damage to the families and friends of those killed and injured,"" he added. ""It is not only a tremendous loss to the families but our entire community who learned of this incredible tragedy or have watched the now viral video of the collision. I’m sure this is a time of great sorrow and grieving for the families and friends of those who will be forever affected by what has transpired.""

Linton reportedly had been working as a nurse at Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Medical Center.

A massive search effort was underway Tuesday morning for the missing California 16-year-old Kiely Rodni, who vanished after telling family she was going to head home from a high school graduation sendoff early Saturday.

The Placer County Sheriff’s Office has said they were investigating a possible abduction because the girl’s SUV was also unaccounted for. Rodni graduated from high school two years early, and it is unlike her to run away or fail to come home, according to her mother, Lindsey Rodni-Nieman

A spokesperson told Fox News Digital Tuesday that investigators were still ""exploring all possibilities"" and confirmed that teens were using alcohol and drugs at the party.

Rodni had enough drinks to become drunk, according to her friend and another recent graduate, Sami Smith, who added that she did not believe the teen would have driven under the circumstances.

""At the point when I left, I thought she was going to stay there,"" said Smith, who departed the campground just a few minutes before Rodni was last seen. ""Everybody was camping. It was late enough that she should have stayed. She’s not the type to go and drunk drive or anything.""

Smith said she spent most of the night with Rodni.

""For the amount of drinks we both had together, she’s not that dumb,"" she added. ""I remember we were partying together. She was having fun. She seemed really happy -- she was like normal, just on an adrenaline rush. Saying ‘Hi’ to everybody.

But Rodni-Nieman, says her daughter texted her around 12:15 a.m. Saturday and said she was heading home. The family lives about 10 miles away from the campground at a lodge south of town.

Smith, 18, said that there were plenty of attendees whom she had not previously met, but none who seemed suspicious, gave unwanted attention or followed the pair around.

She said she didn’t notice anyone much older and that the party consisted mainly of teens, recent graduates and some college students from the surrounding areas. Some came from as far away as San Francisco, she said, but that was not unusual because the area is a summer vacation town.

""We met a few strangers together,"" she said. ""We both tended to trust people, I say tended to because now I don’t think I will continue to trust people. But she’ll give anyone the benefit of the doubt.""

Search crews and police from multiple counties scoured through the area beginning early Tuesday morning.

They started by searching Lake Prosser by boat as the land-based search party gathered on the shoreline.

Several aircraft, including helicopters and airplanes flying in formation above, all-terrain vehicles ranging including four-wheelers, trikes and dirt bikes. There were canines present and at least 100 members of law enforcement visible, including members of the FBI, who initially focused their attention on Campsite 4.

Crews pulled the boats from the water around noon and FBI agents were seen knocking on doors in the area. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""Right now, we are currently searching many areas,"" said Angela Musallam, the Placer County Sheriff’s public information officer.

The party, which stretched from Friday night into Saturday morning at the Prosser Family Campground in the Tahoe National Forest, involved dozens or hundreds of kids from a handful of nearby communities in the rural area, including Truckee, North Lake.

Around 12:15 a.m., she texted her parents that she was heading home. However, according to her mother, no one has come forward to say they saw her leave; no one was with her at the time; and nobody could remember when she left or seeing her car drive away.

Her phone, which last pinged at the party, has been turned off. Authorities say her vehicle, a silver 2013 Honda CRV with the California license plate 8YUR127, is also unaccounted for.

Authorities are urging teens who were at the party to come forward, and the community announced a ""Teen to Teen"" information gathering event from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. PT at the Tahoe City Save Mart in an effort to get attendees talking.

""We have had a lack of reach out from many Tahoe kids who were at the party or may know any information,"" the announcement reads. ""We are only looking for information such as who was at the party that you may have seen ad the times you came and left.""

Rodni’s mother is asking anyone who attended the party and their parents to look through their photos, social media posts and videos for any signs of Rodni. Home and business owners in the surrounding area are also asked to check their surveillance cameras for signs of the girl on Aug. 5 and 6.

Even former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo raised eyebrows on Twitter when he called on the Justice Department to justify the ""raid"" or else jeopardize other investigations like the one into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

MSNBC seemed to change tacks on Tuesday, with more hosts and reporters quoting Trump's ""raid"" language but mostly describing it as a search instead.

""Already the former president has called it a raid. And the veteran FBI officials telling us it’s more of a simple search, which is something they do routinely,"" reporter Kerry Sanders said on Tuesday.

Trump's statement about the FBI raid on Monday employed dramatic language as he declared his home was ""under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents."" The Secret Service allowed the FBI in to conduct its search, which Trump added was an ""unannounced raid.""

Sanders took heat from some conservatives and Republicans for her admonition.

""What is a woman? What is a recession? What is a raid?"" Ted Cruz communications director Steve Guest asked mockingly.

TWITTER SQUIRMS AS BIDEN LOOKS LOST, COUGHS THROUGH SPEECHES, SHAKES HANDS AFTERWARDS: ‘NOT FIT TO SERVE’

Sanders isn't the only MSNBC personality to take exception to the term. As the news broke Monday, anchor Alicia Menendez asked former FBI agent Frank Figliuzzi how the FBI was able to ""pull off this raid."" Figliuzzi, a national security contributor at MSNBC, objected to her terminology during his answer.

""Agents don’t like the word ‘raid,’ they don’t like it. It sounds like it’s some sort of extrajudicial, non-legal thing. It’s an execution of a search warrant. It’s a court-authorized search warrant,"" he said.

Many print outlets used the term ""raid"" independently of Trump, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Associated Press, Reuters, CNBC, Politico and others.

Sources told Fox News on Tuesday that investigators from the Justice Department visited Mar-a-Lago in June for a meeting about turning over records as part of an investigation into documents former President Trump allegedly took with him from the White House to his private residence when he left office in January 2021.

Trump's attorneys were present at that meeting and the sources say the former president himself stopped in to say hello for a few minutes.

The meeting came months after the National Archives — with assistance from the Justice Department — was able to get 15 boxes of documents sent back to Washington, D.C., after expressing concern they were in Florida.

The June meeting was about additional documents that were being sought. But following it, the Justice Department and FBI felt they weren't getting the same cooperation they had been receiving earlier in the probe, according to a source with knowledge of negotiations between Trump's team and the federal entities.

The perceived lack of cooperation is why a search warrant was requested and ultimately executed on Monday, Aug. 8, at Trump's Palm Beach property.

Sanders resigned as a top aide to Harris last year and joined MSNBC, where she hosts the weekend program ""Symone."" She's been followed in that regard by former White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who stepped down in May and will soon have her own Peacock streaming show.

A study posted in the National Library of Medicine documented the ""significant"" increase in body weight in children during coronavirus lockdowns and concluded that young people with pre-existing obesity, of Hispanic and African-American ethnicity and living in poverty suffered the most.

The study, published in July by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, combed through a biomedical literature database to assess ""the extent and risk factors of lockdown-induced weight increase"" as well as ""the impact of obesity on the risk of hospital admission in children and adolescents.""

The study found that a ""significant weight increase was reported in the majority of subjects"" regardless of age and gender, particularly in children who were already struggling with weight issues.

""The highest weight/BMI increase was observed in children with pre-existing overweight/obesity, of Hispanic and African American ethnicity, and in those living unfavorable socioeconomic conditions, therefore, most vulnerable to unhealthy lifestyle, food insecurity, family and social stress (i.e., lower parental psychological and educational support, and higher financial concerns/limitations), and with difficult access to academic resources and healthcare services,"" the study states.

The analysis, which is a conservative estimate based upon recent audit rates and tax filing data, shows that individuals with an annual income of $75,000 or less would be subject to 710,863 additional Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits while those making more than $1 million would receive 52,295 more audits under the bill. The legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, would roughly double the IRS' budget to increase enforcement and, therefore, federal tax revenue.

Overall, the IRS would conduct more than 1.2 million more annual audits of Americans' tax returns, according to the analysis. Another 236,685 of the estimated additional audits would target individuals with an annual income between $75,000 and $200,000.

To boost tax enforcement, the Inflation Reduction Act would appropriate more than $79 billion in additional funds to the IRS over the next decade, nearly doubling the agency's current budget. The IRS is expected to hire tens of thousands more agents to enhance enforcement efforts that are projected to increase revenue by $124 billion.

In response to criticism about the expected uptick in tax audits under the bill, IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said Thursday that ""audit rates"" will not increase relative to recent years.

The legislation doesn't explicitly guarantee that Americans making under $400,000 won't see tax increases under the IRS provision. The bill states that it is not ""intended"" to increase rates for taxpayers who aren't in the top 1% of earners.

""There is language in this bill that provides some guidelines, but it's not at all a guarantee,"" William McBride, the vice president of federal tax and economic policy at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, told FOX Business in an interview. ""It indicates that the intent of the increased spending is not to target those earning less than $400,000. But intent is a somewhat squishy word.""

""The fact of the matter is most returns report income under $100,000,"" he continued. ""That's where the money is, so to speak.""

McBride added that middle-class Americans aren't able to afford the same resources as wealthy individuals to avoid scrutiny.

""People who don't have the resources get a letter in the mail from the IRS threatening them – what are they going to do?

The FBI raid on former President Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago has unleashed a familiar euphoria among critics who have longed for the scene of agents descending upon the president's residence in a criminal operation.

One MSNBC pundit declared on Monday night, after the news of the raid broke, that day of the ""orange jumpsuit"" may finally be at hand while another simply exclaimed ""hallelujah."" It was a tad premature since we do not even know if classified material was found and, if so, whether there is a criminal case to be made from such a discovery.

I previously testified in Congress on the earlier seizure of the boxes at Mar-a-Lago under the Presidential Records Act and how criminal prosecutions have been rare under the law. Nevertheless, criminal charges are possible, including under Section 2071 which states that anyone who ""willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates or destroys … any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited … in any public office."" That crime, however, requires a showing of not just negligence but ""an act is ... done voluntarily and intentionally and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids.""

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA 'UNDER SIEGE' BY FBI AGENTS

Notably, even the most serious cases of mishandling classified records have not resulted in major charges. One example is that of former Clinton National Security Adviser Sandy Berger who was found to have secretly stuffed classified material into his pants and socks to remove them from a secure facility. He then hid them in a spot to be retrieved later. It was a flagrant and premeditated violation of federal law and put national security secrets at risk.

Yet, Berger was allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and did not have to serve any jail time. Indeed, his security clearance was suspended for only three years.

However, critics were not particularly interested in whether Trump might have some suspended misdemeanor sentence. Rather, even before learning if any evidence of criminal conduct was found, critics turned to the ability to use the charge to disqualify Trump from future office.

Section 2071 has excited the imagination of such critics because of a line that states that a convicted party can ""be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.""

That enticing possibility has already been highlighted by Marc Elias, Hillary Clinton's campaign lawyer who was a critical player in pushing the false Russian collusion claims in the Steele dossier. In addition to accusations that he may have lied about the funding of the Steele dossier, Elias has been sanctioned in court for his conduct representing Democratic causes.

RAID ON TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO HOME BY BIDEN'S POLITICIZED FBI MEANS US NOW A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY

Yet, Elias was not alone citing the possible use of a Section 2071 charge to block Trump's expected presidential run in 2024. Former federal prosecutor Harry Litman even suggested that this could be the actual plan of the Justice Department to end Trump's political career: ""So this could be the whole enchilada in terms of DOJ resolution.""

Consider that culinary-legal analysis for a second. The claim is that the Justice Department may be actively seeking to use a charge to block Trump as the real motivation for this raid and possible charge. There is not a hint of concern over the FBI being used to achieve such a political purpose. That is putting aside the fact that, unless there is evidence of a ""willful and unlawful"" effort to conceal or retain such material, the FBI could end up an enchilada short of a combination plate for prosecution.

There is also a significant constitutional hurdle facing this latest means of barring Trump from office. This is not the first time that this disqualification argument has been made and scholars have previously raised constitutional objections to it.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

The problem is that the law would add a qualification or condition that is not stated in the Constitution. There are constitutional ways to impeach a president or to bar a former president from future office. The mishandling of official records is not one of them.

In analogous cases like Powell v. McCormack and U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, the Supreme Court rejected the authority of states to impose new qualifications for congressional seats under Article I. The same is presumably true under Article II when it comes to the chief executive.

There is ample reason to doubt that the presidency would be deemed barred by statute in this fashion. What would not be in doubt is how such a novel claim of disqualification would be received by millions of citizens already skeptical of the motivations of both the Biden administration and specifically the FBI.

The basis and even the motivation of this raid will become clear in time, including whether there is evidence of willful and unlawful conduct by the former president.

A California teacher who received widespread backlash after getting caught on video bragging about how he was working to radicalize his students with far-left ideology was given three years of pay to resign, according to a local report.

Officials in January agreed to pay Gabriel Gipe, a social studies teacher at Inderkum High School, $190,000 to leave his post without fighting his prospective firing, the Sacramento Bee reported, citing settlement records.

After tax, Gipe walked away with a total of $100,000, the paper reported. His annual salary reportedly was $60,000.

Project Veritas exposed Gipe’s teaching methods last year on video, which captured Gipe stating that he tried to ""scare the f---"" out of kids in order to motivate them politically. Footage also surfaced of his classroom, which reportedly included a poster of former Chinese dictator Mao Zedong, as well as one with the Antifa flag.

Gipe also allegedly had a collection of stamps dedicated to Communist dictators, including one of Joseph Stalin and ""an insensitive phrase,"" which he had allegedly used to mark students’ work as complete. Other stamps had images of Fidel Castro and Kim Jong Un.

He also said in the video that a student complained about the Antifa flag hanging on the wall in his classroom, stating that it made him feel uncomfortable.

Well, according to Sanders, the ADG did not afford the same opportunity for her to lay out her education plan, telling her Twitter followers there's a ""reason Americans don't trust the media.

""This February, I reached out to @ArkansasOnline to publish a column outlining my education priorities as governor. They refused,"" Sanders wrote Monday. ""The reason? Discovered on an internal email accidentally sent to my staff… They said it was too ‘campaign-y’ and wanted me to purchase an ad.""

In a separate email shared by Sanders, Barham is seen telling the campaign, ""Thank you for considering us. But because Mrs. Sanders is a candidate for office, this wouldn't work for our Voices page,"" suggesting to reach out to Voices editor Brenda Looper for questions about the paper's policies.

""Americans know the liberal media has one set of rules for Republicans and another for Democrats… But they can’t - and won’t - silence me or YOU,"" Sanders tweeted. ""That’s why I’ve taken my campaign straight to the people - meeting with thousands of Arkansans in all 75 counties. I'll never sit back and let the liberal media peddle their bias and double standards and get away with it.""

She became a national figure when she served as White House press secretary during the Trump administration. Sanders was also a Fox News contributor.

Marc Elias, a top lawyer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, said Monday that former President Trump could be disqualified from making another run at the White House in 2024 following the FBI raid of his Florida residence.

FBI agents executed a search warrant of Trump's Mar-a-Lago property on Monday reportedly seeking classified documents he allegedly took from the White House when he left office in 2021. The search warrant was conducted in connection with the National Archives, according to a senior government official.

This led Elias to cite U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2071 to highlight that Trump could be barred from seeking public office again, as the former president continues to drop hints that he will soon announce plans to seek a second term as commander-in-chief.

""The media is missing the really, really big reason why the raid today is a potential blockbuster in American politics,"" Elias wrote in a tweet.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA ‘UNDER SEIGE’ BY FBI AGENTS

Elias pointed to the passage of U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2071 that states, ""Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.""

However, legal challenges could make efforts to prevent Trump from running again under this code difficult, Elias noted in a follow-up tweet.

""Yes, I recognize the legal challenge that application of this law to a president would garner (since qualifications are set in Constitution). But the idea that a candidate would have to litigate this is during a campaign is in my view a ‘blockbuster in American politics,’"" he wrote.

The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires presidential administrations to preserve certain documents.

According to the National Archives, the presidential records in 15 boxes taken from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year include documents classified over national security concerns.

GOP SLAMS 'WEAPONIZATION' OF DOJ AFTER TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RAIDED BY FBI; DEMS CALL IT 'ACCOUNTABILITY'

The agency has also called on the Department of Justice to probe whether the former president violated federal law in his handling of records.

""Because [the National Archives and Records Administration] identified classified information in the boxes, NARA staff has been in communication with the Department of Justice,"" then-U.S. archivist David Ferriero wrote in a letter to Congress.

Trump released a statement Monday announcing the FBI's raid and he slammed the federal government for its search of his property.

""Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before,"" Trump wrote. ""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate.""

""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections,"" he continued, adding that ""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries.""

A West Virginia University study found that the population of youth who do not identify with their sex at birth may be much higher than previous estimates.

""Gender-diverse youth are incredible young people, and — as our study found — many of them live in rural areas,"" WVU School of Medicine researcher Dr. Kacie Kidd, one of the co-authors of the study, said in a press release Monday. ""It is important that we ensure they have access to support so that they are able to thrive.""

Kidd's comments come after researchers at the university anonymously surveyed close to 3,000 students in grades 7-12 in Appalachian region public schools, finding that more than 7% of respondents identified with a gender other than their sex at birth.

The findings follow a 2017 UCLA study that found West Virginia had the highest per capita rate of transgender youth in the country, estimating that just over 1% of the state's youth identified with a gender other than their sex at birth. The WVU findings suggest that the 2017 study may have severely underestimated that number, which researchers say may be due to the lack of ability to reach youth in rural areas.

CONSERVATIVES ACCUSE TRANS ACTIVIST OF ILLEGALLY SENDING HORMONE ‘DRUGS TO CHILDREN,' CITING SOCIAL MEDIA

Kidd pointed to research she previously worked on that surveyed young people in Pittsburgh, which found that nearly 10% of youth in the Appalachian city had a ""gender-diverse identity.""

""Despite the high prevalence of gender-diverse identities found in our Pittsburgh study, information about rural areas was still unknown,"" Kidd said. ""We suspect that many of the young people in rural Appalachia who shared their gender-diverse identities with us in this study may benefit from additional support, especially if they do not feel seen and supported at home and in their community.""

Kidd pointed out that the numbers could raise issues for public health officials, noting that gender-diverse youth are at increased risk of mental health disorders, suicide, and depression.

""Adolescent mental health is at a crisis point, according to the Centers for Disease Control,"" Kidd said. ""We have an access concern because so many young people need mental health services nationwide and we just don’t have enough mental health professionals to meet that need. It’s a growing problem and certainly gender-diverse youth are at an even greater risk.""

CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL TRANSGENDER YOUTH CENTER CATERS TO PATIENTS AS YOUNG AS AGE 3

The research also comes as the state has been battling a lawsuit filed in 2020 against the state's ban on using Medicaid for transgender surgical procedures.

According to a ruling last week by District Court Judge Robert C. Chambers, the state's exclusion of gender transition surgeries for the treatment of gender dysphoria ""invidiously discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status.""

West Virginia is one of nine states with Medicaid rules that exclude covering transgender medical interventions, though officials in Ohio say their state's ban is not enforced and an Arkansas ban only applies to minors. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration is currently considering a similar exclusion on covering transgender medical interventions such as puberty blockers, hormones, gender transition surgeries or ""any other procedures that alter primary or secondary sexual characteristics,"" according to reporting from The Hill.

The minimum book tax would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income.
The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.","The sweeping climate, health care and tax bill that Senate Democrats passed Sunday includes one of the biggest tax hikes in decades, including a new levy for corporations that repurchase their own stock.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which passed along party lines with Democrats employing the budget reconciliation process, would raise an estimated $739 billion over the next decade, with the revenues going toward initiatives designed to combat climate change and curb pharmaceutical prices, as well as efforts to reduce the nation's $30 trillion debt.

It includes about $433 billion in new spending, while roughly $300 billion of the new revenue raised would go toward paying down the nation's deficit.

Some of the main revenue raisers stem from new levies on wealthy businesses, including a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases that is poised to take effect in 2023. Democrats, who estimated this new levy will raise about $74 billion over the next decade, are hoping to slow companies' tendency to buy back their own stock from investors with the tax.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT: WHAT TAX HIKES ARE IN THE BILL?

Companies have been allowed to buy their own shares since 1982, and the practice has since become commonplace on Wall Street. In 2019, stock buybacks hit a record $1 trillion, according to the SEC. Buybacks already hit a record $281 billion in the first three months of 2022, according to S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt. Although they were down 17.4% in the second quarter.

""I hate stock buybacks,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""I think they are one of the most self-serving things that corporate America does.""

The bill also imposes a 15% minimum tax on corporations based on profits they publicly report on their financial statements to shareholders. The minimum book tax would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income. Democrats said the levy would affect around 200 of the country's largest corporations with profits exceeding $1 billion and that pay less than the current 21% rate for businesses.

Experts expect the two taxes to drag on 2023 earnings, with Goldman Sachs forecasting a 1.5% decline per share of S&P 500 companies. The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.

UBS strategists led by Solita Marcelli, meanwhile, projected the new taxes would have a ""very minimal 1% drag on S&P 500 earnings per share, although some companies will be more affected than others.""

The National Park Service said that a California highway and park roads would remain closed after a rare 1,000-year rain event that caused devastating flooding.

The agency said that around 30 miles of the highway were partially or fully buried under flood debris within Death Valley National Park after Friday's storms.

Thus far, workers have managed to clear debris from approximately 20 miles of the road and about 60% of the debris has been removed from the highway.

A West Virginia man was killed while on vacation with his family after he offered to give a stranger a ride home, his family says.

Josh Wilson, 40, was driving back to his hotel with his wife and son when he stopped at a gas station in Myrtle Beach, SC. While filling up, a man approached and asked for a ride. Josh agreed to pick him up after he'd dropped off his family at the hotel.

""I didn’t think anything of it because he does it all the time,"" his wife, Staci Wilson, told The Sun News. ""He was always kind to everybody.

President Biden signed documents backing the entry of Sweden and Finland into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Tuesday.

""Putin thought he could break us apart… weaken our resolve,"" Biden said during a news conference announcing U.S. ratification of expanding NATO to include Finland and Sweden. ""Instead, he’s getting exactly what he did not want. He wanted the Findalization [Finland-ization] of NATO, but he’s getting the NATO-ization of Finland.""

Before signing the documents, Biden touted the expansion as a ""watershed moment"" that would enhance the security of ""not only Europe and the United States, but of the world.""

Biden urged the rest of the NATO allies to quickly ratify the expansion as well, noting the shared values Finland and Sweden have with the 30-member alliance.

""Sweden and Finland have strong democratic institutions, strong militaries, and strong and transparent economies that will meet every NATO requirement,"" the president said.

Finland and Sweden's membership will be the first significant expansion of the alliance since the Soviet Union's collapse in the 1990s. Their acceptance into the bloc marks a rebuke to Russia amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The Senate approved the move in a rare showing of bipartisan support, voting 95-1 last week in favor of the expansion. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was the only senator to vote against the measure, arguing that it would take focus away from China, which he considers America's primary geopolitical foe.

NATO MAKES THE RIGHT CALL ON SWEDEN, FINLAND IN A BIG, BOLD MOVE

""We can do more in Europe... devote more resources, more firepower ... or do what we need to do to deter Asia and China. We cannot do both,"" Hawley said, according to the Associated Press.

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell welcomed the news, arguing that the move would boost national security.

""Their accession will make NATO stronger and America more secure. If any senator is looking for a defensible excuse to vote no, I wish them good luck,"" McConnell said.

Biden immediately signalled his support for the measure after the Senate vote.

""I look forward to signing the accession protocols and welcoming Sweden and Finland, two strong democracies with highly capable militaries, into the greatest defensive alliance in history,"" Biden said in a statement last week after the Senate overwhelmingly approved their membership.

Finland and Sweden's application to join NATO came in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, with membership in the alliance being strongly opposed by the Kremlin.

NATO's 30 current member-states signed the accession protocol for the two countries last month, clearing the way for the members to formally ratify their membership.

All 30 current NATO members must ratify the decision to allow Finland and Sweden's membership before they can be protected by Article Five of the NATO Charter, which states an attack on one NATO country is an attack on all members.

CNN legal analyst Paul Callan called the Justice Department's raid on former President Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago home a ""daring and dangerous move"" that was ""not warranted"" if it was only about Trump holding onto classified documents after his time in office.

During CNN’s ""At This Hour with Kate Bolduan"" on Wednesday, the host spoke to legal analyst Paul Callan, who expressed hope that the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have something more serious on Trump than currents reports indicate, otherwise their raid on Trump’s massive West Palm Beach residence went too far.

Bolduan prompted Callan by bringing up speculation that the federal government conducted the raid to seize classified documents retained by the former president that he was not authorized to have after leaving the White House.

As Clinton 2016 campaign lawyer Marc Elias mused on Twitter Tuesday evening, Trump may have violated the Presidential Records Act of 1978, prompting the raid, and an ensuing investigation which could bar him from running for political office in the future.

Bolduan asked, ""If this becomes a Presidential Records Act violation, not more, do you think it’s enough to warrant all this?"" Callan responded that it’s not.

""No, it’s not enough to warrant all this,"" the legal analyst declared, adding, ""And this is a daring and dangerous move by the Department of Justice, to serve a warrant on a former president and raid his personal residence.""

Callan inferred that for the government to go this far, there must be ""something more"" than Trump merely holding onto classified documents after his term. ""So, I have to think that the Department of Justice must have something more than an argument about what kind of records have to be saved for a presidential library or the Library of Congress at some future date.""

""There’s more to this than meets the eye,"" Callan continued, adding, ""And I have to think that there’s something a lot more serious that they think is being withheld from the presidential collection.""

Former President Trump, who was in New York City during the time of the raid, condemned the action in a statement on Monday evening, calling it ""prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024.""

He added that ""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries.""

Other GOP leaders, including Governor Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., and former Vice President Mike Pence condemned the raid as well.

On Monday evening, the Florida governor tweeted, ""The raid of MAL [Mar-a-Lago] is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves. Now the Regime is getting another 87k IRS agents to wield against its adversaries? Banana Republic.""

""Yes it would,"" Schumer agreed. After asking Schumer about the sprawling Inflation Reduction Act and working with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Maddow brought up the Mar-a-Lago raid again but noted that she understood he didn't want to talk about the substance of it.

""With the FBI raiding the president’s house today at Mar-a-Lago — and I know you don’t want to talk about that in substance — it seems clear, I think it seems obvious to both of us that we’re about to enter into a new and more intense area of the Republicans and the Trump-supporting Republicans really waging war on law enforcement and especially on the idea of federal law enforcement. And I wonder if you’ve been thinking strategically about that, about defending those institutions, defending that part of the executive branch that enforces federal law against the sort of politicized attacks that are coming their way?"" she asked.

The video begins with Trump painting America as ""a nation in decline"" and discussing a myriad of issues ranging from fallout from the withdrawal of Afghanistan to skyrocketing energy prices. It begins in black and white with the sound of an ominous thunderstorm in the background.

""We are a nation that allowed Russia to devastate a country, Ukraine, killing hundreds of thousands of people, and it will only get worse.,"" Trump narrates. ""We are a nation that has weaponized its law enforcement against the opposing political party like never before.""

Inflation is currently surging and increased in June to a new 40-year high, marking the fifth time it's broken that record this year. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 9.1% annually in June, hitting its highest point since November 1981, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

Because of this, many consumers are needing to dip into their savings or fund their purchases with credit, according to data from Morning Consult Economic Intelligence . Intentions to buy big-ticket items such as electronics, trips and vacations, home appliances and furniture have all decreased over the past year.

But despite these setbacks, consumer balance sheets are historically strong, according to Morning Consult. Net wealth as a share of disposable income is currently near a record high as household debt as a share of total assets is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, according to data from the Federal Reserve.

Because of this, some consumers, especially from higher-income households, are actually increasing their spending and expected spending, according to the Morning Consult report. Households with an annual income of at least $50,000 reported a 25% increase in monthly spending from May 2021 to May 2022.

""To put it simply: People still have the means to buy things, but they are expecting items to cost more,"" the report stated. ""And Morning Consult data indicates that they’re using BNPL to pay for some of them. The consistency with which U.S. consumers have used BNPL to fund their purchases throughout 2022 indicates that the payment form may be helping to keep their price sensitivity and substitutions at bay, and should be viewed as an indicator of the staying power of BNPL.""

If you have used BNPL to pay for your purchases and want to pay it down, consider using a personal loan to help pay your debt. Visit Credible to compare multiple lenders at once and choose the one with the best interest rate for you.

Americans continue to use BNPL options for purchases

The use of BNPL payments is not slowing, and the share of adults who used BNPL to fund a purchase at least once in the past month has not dropped below 16% in 2022, according to Morning Consult’s report.

Adults with annual income between $50,000 and $99,999 as well as those with an annual income of $100,000 or more are even more likely to have used BNPL for a purchase over the past month at 21% and 20%, respectively.

And consumers expect to continue using BNPL.

""As more retailers partner with BNPL providers and more payment providers create their own BNPL offerings, adoption and strong usage will likely continue,"" the report stated.

Even as consumers purchase less big ticket items, they will continue to use BNPL for a wide variety of other purchases. Morning Consult’s report showed 35% of respondents used BNPL to purchase apparel, 32% used it to purchase electronics and 23% used it for footwear.

Across the country, librarians in schools and public libraries are stocking the shelves with material that is so pornographic that when parents have tried to read aloud and show the material at school board meetings, their microphones were cut off.

For progressives, the victim of the situation isn’t the children exposed to inappropriate content; the hero of the story isn’t the parents fighting for their kids’ innocence. No, the hero and victim of the coverage of these incidents are the librarians buying the sexually explicit content and recommending it to children.

Librarians are putting themselves on the front lines of a culture war, often shooting the first shots, and then bemoaning that they’ve found themselves under fire. But here’s the thing: Libraries have turned themselves into battlegrounds for these arguments, and librarians, one of the most radically progressive professions, have made them that way.

If you’re hosting drag queen story hour and stocking literal pornography on the shelves, you’ve surrendered the right to just ask for a quiet and respectful conversation about how you’re doing your job.

FLORIDA SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER DEMANDS ‘DISCIPLINARY ACTION’ OVER PORNOGRAPHIC BOOKS IN SCHOOLS: ‘I’M DISGUSTED'

How libraries are functioning is an assault on our children, paid for by our tax dollars. It’s long past time for parents to fight back, even if they’re called book banners for doing so. Librarians turned themselves into political warriors and are trying to make our kids into their foot soldiers. They don’t get to do so without a fight.

Progressives have received their talking points on the matter. Efforts on the part of parents to make sure that inappropriate and pornographic materials aren’t available to their children is called ""book banning."" In April, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., chairman of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, held a hearing to examine what he called ""the ongoing efforts across the country to ban books from schools and public libraries.""

A single mother of a middle schooler in Raskin’s district, Marilyn (who asked to be anonymous for professional reasons), shared with me her own story. She told me,

""My daughter started asking to go to the school early so she could spend some time in the library and came home with 'George' by Alex Gino. I had not heard of this book, and have yet to meet the school librarian. I asked my daughter if she picked out the book and she told me that the librarian gave it to her and said she thought she would like it. I still have no idea why.

""The school librarian also apparently said the same things about 'Rick' by Alex Gino. 'The Art of Being Normal' by Lisa Williamson also came home from the school library. These three books are the only books that came home from the school library in Montgomery County in 2021-2022.""

Gino’s book ""George,"" which has since been renamed ""Melissa,"" has been at the top of the American Library Association’s list of Top 10 Most Challenged Books for several years. The ALA, with its list, posit the book challenges are akin to censorship. Here’s a sample from ""George,"" just to get an idea of what many parents objected to:

""George stopped. It was such a short little question, but she couldn’t make her mouth form the sounds.

""Mom, what if I’m a girl?

""George had seen an interview on television a few months ago with a beautiful woman named Tina. She had golden-brown skin, thick hair with blond highlights, and long, sparkling fingernails. The interviewer said that Tina had been born a boy, then asked her whether she’d had the surgery. The woman replied that she was a transgender woman and that what she had between her legs was nobody’s business but hers and her boyfriends.

""So George knew it could be done. A boy could become a girl. She had since read on the Internet you could take girl hormones that would change your body, and you could get a bunch of different surgeries if you wanted them and had the money. This was called transitioning. You could even start before you were 18 with pills called adrogen blockers that stopped the boy hormones already inside you from turning your body into a man’s. But for that, you needed your parents’ permission.""

All you have to do is permanently mutiliate yourself with major surgery and hormone therapy; it’s as easy as taking antibiotics!

In 2021, Gino’s ""George / Melissa"" was finally getting knocked out of the top spot by a new book, ""Gender Queer,"" by Maia Kobabe. In its coverage of the ""book banning"" wars in the its Sunday newsletter, the New York Times interviewed Alexandra Alter, a Times reporter covering the publishing industry on the subject, and in its graphics illustrating the newsletter item, ""Gender Queer"" was one of the books highlighted.

Alter was asked, ""How are librarians responding?"" And Alexandra laid it on, thick with her reply, ""It’s heartbreaking for them. Librarians say they got into this field because of a love of reading and talking to people about books. Some have left their jobs; some have been fired for refusing to remove books. Others quit after being subject to a barrage of insults on social media.""

Alter recently sounded a similar tone in a piece she wrote for the Times about the plight of the librarians facing backlash for their choices in purchasing and display choices,

""As highly visible and politicized book bans have exploded across the country, librarians – accustomed to being seen as dedicated public servants in their communities – have found themselves on the front lines of an acrimonious culture war, with their careers and their personal reputations at risk.""

This is the message the Times and progressives have committed themselves to: Our tax dollars should remain a discretionary fund on behalf of librarians pushing a radical racial and gender ideology on our children.

President Joe Biden's foreign policy is a toxic mix of ideas from both extremes of the political spectrum.

On the one hand, Biden and company have embraced the Obama era policy of maximum restraint. The idea is that the less the U.S. engages in foreign affairs, the fewer problems it will have to deal with.

The problem with maximum restraint is that it can let a manageable foreign problem fester and grow into a tremendous problem. It’s like when a homeowner keeps putting off fixing a leaky roof; one day the ceiling will collapse.

WHITE HOUSE SUMMONS CHINESE AMBASSADOR AMID MILITARY EXERCISES, DIPLOMATIC RETALIATION FOR PELOSI TAIWAN VISIT

Maximum restraint can also lead to precipitous withdrawal from foreign engagements. This too can be disastrous. For example, Obama precipitously withdrew from Iraq, and ISIS promptly filled the vacuum. Biden did the same in Afghanistan, and we now know that Al Qaeda has already reestablished a foothold there.

The reality is: Whenever America walks away, our adversaries happily fill in. Just look at what happened at our southern border. As soon as Biden reversed all of Trump’s border security measures, the cartels started lining up people to come across.

On the other hand, Biden is often over-eager to engage on the world stage, turning American interests over to globalist management. The idea is that we can make the world safer, more equitable and more just if we follow the wisdom of global elites and govern according to international agreements on everything from climate policy and tax policy to labor policy and the treatment of women.

The problem with this is that it can sacrifice our national interests — and our sovereignty — abiding by international compacts that our enemies ignore, and our friends find preposterous. For example, the Chinese have zero intent of following the U.S. into the abyss of ""net zero"" green energy policy. To keep their economy growing, they are building coal plants right and left.

Yet, Biden persists in thinking that he and other leaders of developed nations can establish global ""norms"" by pledging to follow the dictates of Davos. This is like the little kid sitting in a grocery cart who thinks he is steering down the aisle.

By following these impulses to 1) do nothing and 2) tell everyone else what to do, Biden believes he is reducing risk and making a better world. In reality, what he has is a schizophrenic foreign policy that has increased global risk and left our friends and allies dazed and confused.

The most recent victim of this approach was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Her trip to Taiwan was important. And the stakes were high. China is America’s No. 1 threat, and Taiwan is the most serious issue that divides us. One would think every step the president would take would be serious, deliberate and proactive, because that is how serious people deal with serious risks. Not Joe.

His first instinct was to try to make the problem go away. So, he asked Pelosi to cancel the visit. This would have been a big slap in the face to Taiwan and a huge loss of face for the U.S.

When Pelosi refused, Biden then called Chinese President Xi Jinping and, after meekly reassuring him that the U.S. still clings to the ""One China Policy."" asked him to back down from his regime’s saber-rattling rhetoric opposing the trip. Again, no effect.

Indeed, throughout the crisis, Biden came across — to China, to Taiwan, to Pelosi and the rest of the world — as little more than a do-nothing Bystander-in-Chief. (Though, in fairness, he did tweet afterward.)

Once Pelosi left, China ramped-up its ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy ringing Taiwan with live fire drills. The administration response was mostly finger-waving at the Chinese, tut-tutting that they were not following the international norms as approved by our globalist overlords in Davos. Beijing must still be laughing.

But this is no laughing matter. Just ask Ukraine. When Putin threatened to invade, Biden tried the mix of do nothing, threatening with a handful of sanctions, and finger-waving about international norms. Rather than being deterred, Russia started a war that has harmed our economy and lowered our national security.

When will U.S. foreign policy get better instead of worse? The answer is: When the administration starts dealing with risks, rather than ignoring them."

Unknown to most Americans, the Chinese Communist Party has been buying our farms, land and even our homes for decades. Why? So they can take our food, technology and other resources for themselves.

What’s worse – it’s perfectly legal. That’s why I’ve introduced a bill to ban the Chinese Communists – and those acting on their behalf – from buying even another handful of American soil.

In recent years, China has exponentially increased its U.S. land holdings, especially of farmland. Between 2010 and 2020, China increased its agricultural land holding by nearly 2,500%, to encompass over 350,000 acres of American soil. Communists have not only purchased the fields and pastures of rural America, they have also taken control of food processing companies like the Virginia-based pork giant, Smithfield.

Chinese communists are gobbling up American agriculture in part because China can’t feed itself. While China is home to nearly 20% of the world’s population, it has less than 10% of the world’s farmable land. As a result, Beijing is forced to go elsewhere for sources of food, especially meat and other forms of protein.

TUCKER CARLSON: WHILE CHINA BUYS UP AMERICAN FARMLAND, WE MAY RUN OUT OF FOOD

And the CCP’s purchases in the U.S. have largely paid off. At the height of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, Smithfield made sure China got the pork it needed – while American groceries stores ran short. By taking our land and food-processing companies for themselves, Chinese communists benefit their own people and gain leverage over the United States in one fell swoop.

But that isn’t the only reason China is putting down roots in the United States. In some cases, they use our land as strategic outposts to steal advanced American seed and farming technology. In other cases, they’ve bought large tracts of land near U.S. military bases.

In North Dakota, a Chinese firm purchased 300 acres a few miles from a U.S. Air Force base, which reportedly is home to America’s most sophisticated military drone technology. The base also has been called ""the backbone of all U.S. military communications across the globe."" Similarly, in Texas, a former Chinese military official purchased over 130,000 acres on the U.S.-Mexico border conspicuously close to Laughlin Air Force Base.

As young Americans move off family farms and their aging parents increasingly retire from the business, China could buy even more. Millions of acres are expected to change hands in the next decade. We must ensure they don’t fall into the clutches of the Chinese Communist Party.

But the communists aren’t just capturing American agricultural land – they’ve also bought an astonishing amount of American real estate. Between 2010 and 2020, the American Realtors Association estimates that Chinese nationals bought over $200 billion worth of American real-estate, more than any other country in the world.

China’s 300,000-plus residential purchases in the United States since 2010 pose an unknown national-security danger, in addition to fueling the rising cost of living in places like California, where a disproportionate number of Chinese nationals buy. For America, allowing China to purchase our land is a lose-lose proposition.

Talk about a find.

A treasure trove of jewels, medallions and historic artifacts has been uncovered in the Bahamas that date back to the legendary 17th century Maravillas shipwreck — and the public can now get a look at it.

Nuestra Señora de las Maravillas (Our Lady of Wonders), a two-deck Spanish galleon, sank on Jan. 4, 1656, off the Little Bahama Bank in the northern Bahamas on a trip to Seville from Cuba.

It had been carrying numerous treasures of both royal tax and private property.

ALL-WOMEN ROWING TEAM BREAKS WORLD RECORD IN RACE ACROSS PACIFIC OCEAN

The 891-ton ship went down after colliding with its fleet flagship.

It struck a reef 30 minutes later — and ultimately sank.

The remains of the vessel were scattered for several miles across the ocean, with no significant portion of the ship left behind.

For more than 360 years, archeologists and adventurers have attempted to locate the debris that was lost in the wreckage.

And while much of the treasure — an estimated 3.5 million pieces, out of eight — was salvaged between 1656 and the early 1990s, modern-day technology tools such as high-resolution magnetometers, enhanced GPS and metal detecting have allowed Allen Exploration to bring to the surface riches beyond the imagination.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, Allen Exploration founder Carl Allen said that he and his team began pulling up precious artifacts in July 2020 near Walker’s Cay.

MILITARY VETERANS PRESERVE CORAL REEFS IN UNIQUE FLORIDA DIVE MISSION

High-tech tools, plus the official permission they received from the Bahamanian government to search the Northern Bahamas area — known to be a wreckage hotspot — have made for ""quite amazing"" discoveries, the entrepreneur said.

""We’ve recovered thousands of artifacts,"" he said.

""Cannons, anchors, emeralds and amethysts … We’re up to about 3,000 silver coins and 25 gold coins,"" he said.

The water in the area only reaches up to 50 feet deep, while the sand can bury treasures down to 20 feet, he revealed.

Yet that didn’t stop Allen from proving his doubters wrong and discovering treasures that took his breath away.

""When I pulled up the first valuable item, I lost my breath,"" he said. ""I couldn't breathe.""

""I've been thinking about this my whole life.""

The fascinating finds also include Spanish olive jars, Chinese porcelain and iron rigging, according to an AllenX press release.

The team also discovered a silver sword handle belonging to the soldier Don Martin de Aranda y Gusmán; the item helped the teams identify these treasures as belonging to the sunken Maravillas.

One golden pendant with the Cross of Santiago was designed in the shape of a scallop shell.

Four pendants worn by members of the sacred Order of Santiago, a religious band of knights active in Spanish maritime trade, were also recovered.

AllenX considered the Order of Santiago jewels to be the ""star"" finds thus far.

One golden pendant with the Cross of Santiago was designed in the shape of a scallop shell.

It's reinforced by what appears to be an Indian bezoar stone — a famous European stone known for its healing properties.

Another golden pendant garners the same cross overlaying a large, ovular Columbian emerald.

Three gold chains were retrieved, including an 887-gram gold filigree chain made up of 80 circular links and decorated with four-lobed rosette motifs, most likely crafted in the Philippines, the group said.

One golden pendant with the Cross of Santiago was designed in the shape of a scallop shell.

AllenX indicated that no exact replicas of the chain exist from other excavations in museum collections or as seen in Spanish portrait art.

Allen Exploration archeologist Jim Sinclair told Fox News Digital that these artifacts reveal how people lived in the colonial period and in the New World.

As an archeologist of 40 years, and as an original explorer of iconic wrecks such as the Titanic, Sinclair said a recovery such as the one from the Maravillas reflects an ""amazing leap"" in technology.

The archeologist also considered the artifact analysis to be a ""really good development"" in terms of detecting human behavior and history.

Although the worth of these artifacts most likely add up to the millions of dollars, the items are priceless, said Bill Springer, Allen Exploration spokesperson.

MIAMI-BOUND BOAT CAPSIZES OFF COAST OF THE BAHAMAS

The museum is set to open on Saturday, Aug. 6, 2022.

It will reveal other exhibits about maritime history in the Bahamas, as well as the transatlantic slave trade and the Lucayan people.

Only 45 survivors

The Maravillas exhibit also showcases the story of the ship’s demise.

Of the nearly 650 passengers who were on board the ship, only 45 are known to have survived.

No human remains have been located.

The shipwreck was a ""tremendous blow,"" Allen explained, since Spain at the time was struggling financially and the boat was jam-packed with valuables.

It was one of the largest treasure ships to have ever left the Indies — which is why Allen said he expects more artifacts to be uncovered still.

The ""mother lode"" has yet to be discovered.

The ""mother lode"" has yet to be discovered, he indicated; and when it is, he said the haul would be ""extremely valuable.""

""The manifest usually on these old ships, a lot of times — it was only about half of what was on the ship because there was so much contraband,"" he said.

""So, that's what's exciting.""

Along with launching the museum, Allen is furthering his passion for discovery and education by developing underwater archeology programs for Bahamian kids.

""The big problem is, [the debris] is not going to stay there forever,"" he said.

""And it’s a playground of shipwreck.""

During McPhee's rant, the singer said she will no longer be wearing her expensive jewelry, specifically on her wrists and fingers, while she’s out and about in Los Angeles. In her posts, she also mentioned her endorsement of Rick Caruso, who is running for mayor in Los Angeles.

In her first Instagram story, McPhee, 38, reshared an article about an elderly man being ""jumped,"" ""mugged and beaten up"" in the upscale city.

""This is literally my worry and thought every time I go out now. We need @rickcarusola,"" she wrote alongside the article. McPhee continued: ""What's this world coming to?""

Her next slide showed a conversation with her friend, Sara Mann, who advised her not to wear any expensive jewelry. ""Don't wear your Rolex,"" Mann told McPhee. McPhee responded with, ""No rings no watches.""

""This is the real life text/convos you have with fam and friends about living in LA now. We need @rickcarusola,"" she wrote alongside the screenshot.

McPhee then uploaded an image of herself with both of her hands in the air to prove that she did not have any pricey jewelry on. ""No rings watches or anything out in LA anymore,"" she wrote before tagging Caruso again.

In February, McPhee slammed Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor of Georgia, for posing maskless with a group of schoolchildren despite a mandate being in place.

""What the actual hell… politicians at their finest. Mask up the children and you yourself sit without a mask. The hypocrisy continues,"" McPhee wrote on her Instagram story at the time. ""I’m sure she will say… ‘but I had my mask in my hand!’""

Abrams had already responded to the backlash the photo caused after sitting Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp joined several other conservatives in criticizing the candidate over the photo.

Jennette McCurdy is opening up about her childhood trauma.

McCurdy revealed she was ""exploited"" when she was a child actor on Nickelodeon’s ""iCarly"" and ""Sam & Cat.""

She says her overbearing mother and the television industry were both to blame, as they ""failed to protect her,"" according to the New York Times.

'ICARLY' STAR JENNETTE MCCURDY RECALLS PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL ABUSE FROM MOTHER DURING CHILDHOOD

At the age of 16, McCurdy was entering her third year on the hit teen sitcom ""iCarly,"" where she made millions of young viewers laugh by playing the comedic character Sam Puckett.

The former actress gets candid in her new memoir, ""I’m Glad My Mom Died,"" in which she details her toxic relationship with her mother and her tumultuous time on Nickelodeon.

According to the New York Times, McCurdy, 30, wrote in her memoir about embarrassing moments on the children’s television network when she was asked to be ""photographed in a bikini during a wardrobe fitting and being encouraged to drink alcohol by an intimidating figure she simply calls the Creator.""

McCurdy pointed out that when her mother was present, she never interjected or instructed her daughter that this ""was the price of showbiz success.""

""Everyone wants what you have,"" she allegedly told her daughter.

In McCurdy’s memoir, which will be published on Aug. 9, she recounted auditioning for acting roles at the age of 6 and being ""shepherded"" into the work by her controlling mother. She also noted that she suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders and anxiety. McCurdy believed she owed her loyalty to her mother, who controlled every aspect of her life.

After McCurdy starred on ""iCarly,"" Nickelodeon promised her a spinoff series of her own, but walked back on their offer and made Ariana Grande a co-lead on ""Sam & Cat.""

McCurdy says she felt undermined by the network as they discouraged her from exploring other career opportunities outside the show. However, those rules did not seem to apply to Grande.

""What finally undid me was when Ariana came whistle-toning in with excitement because she had spent the previous evening playing charades at Tom Hanks’s house. That was the moment I broke,"" McCurdy wrote.

""Sam & Cat"" aired for only one season during 2013-2014, and after the show's cancellation, Nickelodeon offered the former actress $300,000 to keep her experiences at the network private, McCurdy said. She refused the offer.

Despite ""iCarly"" star Miranda Cosgrove saying that she and McCurdy quickly became friends on the show, she was not completely aware of the challenges her friend faced in her life.

It is not a converted VW this time around, however. It uses a custom aluminum monocoque chassis with rear independent suspension, rear-wheel drive and seating for two.

Full technical specifications haven't been revealed, but the plan is to offer it with two battery sizes. A 20 kilowatt-hour pack good for 150 miles of driving and a 40 kilowatt-hour pack that will let it cover 300 miles between charges.

THE VW DUNE BUGGY IS BACK FOR AN ELECTRIC FUTURE

The relatively long ranges provided by such small packs is enabled in part by the vehicle's low weight, which is estimated to be around 1,500-1,650 pounds.

The motor that comes with the larger pack will be rated at 202 horsepower and 240 pound-feet of torque, which the company says will allow it to accelerate to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds.

Pricing hasn't yet been announced, and the company hasn't clarified how the vehicle will be legally classified, but it will be offering 50 beta models for sale next year to buyers who agree to provide feedback before full production begins in 2024.

Is it Bigfoot — or a big fluke?

An Ohio woman claims that Sasquatch has returned to the woods near her home, based on an audio recording that she herself made of what she heard.

Suzanne Ferencak shared with Mansfield News Journal last week that this is the first time she’s ever recorded howling in her nearly decade-long tenure as a Bigfoot hunter.

An analyst described the two-minute recording as having ""high potential"" of carrying the sounds of one Bigfoot attempting to contact another, the News Journal reported.

""The first howler has a brassy tone to its voice that can be indicative"" of Sasquatch, the analyst said.

""There are a couple [of] features in the execution, such as shifting to an 'AA' phoneme at the end of the call that are indicative as well, most noticeable in the last two howls.""

Other wildlife experts aren’t so sure the sounds came from a Bigfoot creature, however, according to a USA Today report.

Workers at nearby Mohican State Park suggested that the sounds could’ve come from an alpha male coyote calling its pack.

The Bigfoot enthusiast first spotted the beast in May 2013 when it allegedly hopped over a back road southeast of her hometown of Loudonville, Ohio.

Ferencak told the News Journal that her rural home is prime habitat for Bigfoot and, for several years, experienced knocks and howls around the area — as well as other sightings, she said.

""I've been doing this for nine years.""

Ferencak finally caught the most recent loud howls on July 3 of this year. She suspects that the sounds came from a young or female Bigfoot calling to her babies.

It's an out-of-this-world project car.

A 1971 Chevrolet Corvette originally driven by Apollo 15 astronaut Al Worden, which was all but forgotten and left to the elements on a used car lot for years, will soon be ready to hit the road again.

The coupe was one of three that were leased to the mission's crew for a year for just $1 each by Melbourne, Florida, Chevrolet dealer and 1960 Indy 500 winner Jim Rathmann.

Rathmann had been leasing Corvettes to astronauts since the Mercury program, fully aware of the promotional value of having American heroes cruising around in his cars, but the Apollo 15 crew was the last.

GENERAL MOTORS BUILDING LUNAR TERRAIN VEHICLE FOR RETURN TO THE MOON

Command module pilot Worden and his crewmates, James Irwin and David Scott, ordered theirs in red, white and blue with coordinating stripes. Worden chose a white one with a 454 cubic-inch V8 under the hood and a Muncie 4-speed manual transmission.

He returned it at the end of the lease, and it was sold into private ownership, changing hands several times and ending up in Texas.

That’s where noted Corvette collector Danny Reed discovered it and added it to his collection in 2017, officially documenting its history in the process.

Reed also owns Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean’s 1969 Corvette, which he purchased directly from GM in 1971, along with Dave Scott’s blue 1971 model. Worden’s car was functional when Reed found it but very weathered from sitting outside for who knows how many years.

Max Kaiserman, the owner of space program merchandise marketplace Luna Replicas and friend of Worden’s, told Fox News Autos that Worden’s grandson, Will Penczak, found out about the car and visited it at Reed’s in 2020. Worden passed away the same year, and Penczak and Reed got to talking about what should happen to the car.

""We want to continue Al Worden’s legacy of inspiring young people to get into science and math and the arts""

Kaiserman and Penczak decided to team up and purchase it; not to fix and flip it at an auction but to become its custodians and share it with the world. They’ve now started Project AstroVette Endeavor and plan to restore it to some extent and use it as an educational tool by displaying it at science museums and other events.

OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD DRIVER EUGENE CERNAN RECOUNTS HIS RIDE ON THE MOON

""We want to continue Al Worden’s legacy of inspiring young people to get into science and math and the arts, all of which the space program and the Corvette represent,"" Kaiserman said.

The 80,000-mile car currently runs and is mostly-rust free, but it’s had some minor repairs and a few parts replaced over the years, so they’re still deciding what to do with it. Whether to preserve it as-is or bring it back to as close to original condition as possible.

A refresh to the standards of the National Corvette Restorers Society could run over $100,000, according to Kaiserman, while an extensive rotisserie show car-quality restoration might cost a quarter-million or more.

They’re open to any support for the project and are also asking anyone with photos of the car from the 1970s to share them to help get a better sense of its original condition, right down to what tires were on it when Worden had it. As of now, they only have one photo from Life magazine featuring the three astronauts and their cars parked behind the mission's Lunar Roving Vehicle, which was the first to go to the moon.

""How incredible is that the first astronauts to drive on the moon were also the last to drive Rathmann Corvettes,"" Kaiserman said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has mishandled California's severe, years-long drought during his time in office, while the state's farms face diminishing yields, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News.

""I think Gavin Newsom has failed when it comes to water,"" McCarthy, who represents a district in California's Central Valley, said.

For the second time in nine years, California is facing a generational drought – a period of dryness so severe, they're typically thought to only occur once per generation, according to Erik Ekdahl, the California State Water Resources Control Board's deputy director for water rights. The Golden State has also endured a megadrought – a drought that lasts longer than 20 years – since 2000, Ekdahl said.

""I think the state has actually done some remarkably good planning and preparation and implementation for drought,"" Ekdahl told Fox News.

""You'll go see tens of thousands of acres that used to have nuts, almonds, pistachios, and they're just bare,"" Parnagian told Fox News. ""It's just all dust.""

California saw a brief reprieve from drought in 2019, just months after Newsom took office, according to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Drought Center. But by 2021, the state was once again plunged into severe dryness on a wide scale – and it could get worse.

""There's a very real prospect for a fourth year and potentially a fifth year of drought,"" Ekdahl told Fox News.

Newsom, a Democrat, needed to use the drought-free period to prepare, McCarthy said.

""You should store it in the abundant years to have it for the years coming forward when it comes to drought,"" McCarthy, a Republican, told Fox News. ""That would show you good management.""

McCarthy's district includes part of Kern County, 70% of which is characterized as facing ""exceptional"" drought conditions, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Exceptional drought, the most intense and devastating type of drought, can lead to widespread wildlife death, the removal of orchards, increased chances of wildfire and low crop yields, according to NOAA.

LAS VEGAS 'WATER COPS' PATROL FOR WATER WASTERS AMID UNPRECEDENTED DROUGHT

Newsom outlined a 142-step plan in 2020 to make California more resilient to drought. It included long-term projects such as new water storage construction, surveying for new water sources and the deconstruction of dams.

Many of those haven't been built, according to a progress report published in January. Ekdahl said many of the water projects could take years to be completed.

""They haven't built any new water storage, no new dams,"" McCarthy told Fox News. They continue to let water go out into the ocean.""

Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment.

""The Governor has worked with the legislature to invest $8 billion to implement the strategies in the Water Resilience Portfolio , which focuses on diversifying our water supplies, enhancing ecosystems, improving infrastructure and ensuring California is better able to manage hotter and drier weather"" Erin Mellon, a Newsom spokesperson, told the Los Angeles Times in July.

CALIFORNIA REDUCES SUPPLIES TO WATER AGENCIES AMID DROUGHT

But others agreed with McCarthy.

""These days, the Newsom administration and Legislature have done little more than engage in water shaming,"" Steven Greenhut, the R Street Institute's western region director, wrote in the Orange County Register. ""Where are the plans to bolster our water-storage capacities?""

Newsom in 2021 asked Californians to voluntarily cut water use by 15%, but in March 2022, usage increased by 19%. The governor threatened to make restrictions mandatory in response.

""There’s no need to shame Westerners for their water usage, but there is reason to shame our officials for not doing their part to upgrade and build new water infrastructure,"" Greenhut wrote, noting that Newsom should use California's nearly $100 billion surplus to invest in water facilities. He also blamed former Gov. Jerry Brown for inaction during another drought reprieve when he was in office.

Yet Newsom has also faced criticism for not imposing harsher restrictions.

""We know it’s an election year and Newsom doesn’t want to anger voters, but failing to impose mandatory water cuts in the midst of this crisis demonstrates a stunning lack of leadership,"" the Mercury News and East Bay Times editorial boards wrote.

HOUSE APPROVES BILL TO HELP WEST FIGHT WILDFIRES, DROUGHT

About 80% of water use in California is used for agriculture, according to the state Department of Water Resources.

""We're one of the most fertile lands in all the world, and we should be using it to maximize our industry here in California and food for the world,"" Parnagian told Fox News.

But the drought has even restricted farmers' water usage, consequently lowering their economic output, according to Ekdahl.

Some livestock farmers have even had to sell their cattle, a move that could cause beef prices to surge, FOX Business previously reported.

""You're seeing that people are starting to farm to the water that's available,"" Parnagian told Fox News. ""And in doing that, we're limited on the crops we can grow. We're limited on the yields that we can get.""

California rice producers are weighing importing from Japan and South Korea as domestic production has severely dropped, S&P Global Commodity Insights reported.

The former climate and conservation manager for the California State Water Resources Control Board, Max Gomberg, also felt Newsom wasn't properly handling water resiliency. But Gomberg, who said he left his post because the governor wasn't aggressive enough on climate change, felt agriculture has received preferential treatment.

""There are the zillions of acres of almonds and grapes. It’s not sustainable,"" Gomberg told the LA Times. ""Everyone knows it’s not sustainable, just like everyone knows the amount of withdrawals from the shrinking Colorado River system are not sustainable.""

Meanwhile, only five of California's 17 major reservoirs, which provide water for agricultural use, are over 50% capacity, and eight are below 35% capacity, according to the California Department of Water Resources.

""What we're seeing just over the last nine years or so, seven of the last nine years have been dry or critically dry,"" Ekdahl told Fox News. ""That's just put long-term stress on our reservoirs, how we use water and ecosystems and people that depend on it."""

Fischer also told Fox News he saw a shift once he began making of President Biden's age and low energy.","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Three comics separately said freedom of speech will prevail over a small, but vocal group of cancel culture warriors aiming to censor comedians.

""Comedians just need to stop buying into all the noise, and they need to just start telling jokes how they want,"" Tyler Fischer, a New York stand-up comic, told Fox News. ""You're never going to develop as an artist unless you cross the line.""

Comedians, like Dave Chappelle, have been high-profile targets of cancel culture in recent years. Most recently, Minneapolis' First Avenue canceled Chappelle's sold out show hours before his set time after the storied venue faced backlash from its staff and community over the superstar comedian's jokes about the transgender community.

""Too often, too much credit is given to the way people interpret what you're saying or what you're doing as a comedian rather than what your real intentions are,"" Josh Denny, a Los Angeles comedian, told Fox News.

DAVE CHAPPELLE COMEDY SPECIAL QUIETLY RELEASED ON NETFLIX FOLLOWING ‘THE CLOSER’ TRANSPHOBIC JOKE CONTROVERSY

""When venues like First Avenue cave to the mob, that's what's dangerous,"" Denny continued. ""That basically tells all those transgender people that what they think Dave Chappelle saying about them is true, and that's not the case at all.""

The comedians told Fox News they believed the people aiming to censor comedians represented a small, but over-pronounced portion of America.

""We've just inflamed the very small minority of people who are sensitive and giving them superpowers,"" Fischer said. ""I don't think America has gotten too sensitive.""

Denny similarly said: ""The people that want to censor comedy or cancel comedians who are being edgy, taking risks, pushing the envelope, I think they're a very, very organized, vocal minority of people. There really is a clamoring and I think a resurgence of audiences that just don't want politically correct comedy anymore.""

Chrissie Mayr, a New York stand-up comic, told Fox News that censoring comedians is ""the most selfish thing you can do.""

""It's like 'Oh, I don't like this comedian … Not only do I not want to see them, but I want to make sure nobody else can see them,'"" she said.

JOHN CLEESE SAYS WOKENESS HAS A ‘DISASTROUS’ IMPACT ON COMEDY

Yet comedians have altered their jokes to align with shifting societal norms throughout history, Kliph Nesteroff, a comedy historian, has written.

""The tug of war between censorship and free speech has been part of comedy for its entire existence,"" Nesteroff wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed. ""It is likely to continue.""

He provided examples of 20th century comedians getting arrested or banned for their jokes.

Still, Fischer said modern cancel culture censored his own comedy for nearly a decade out of fear.

""I've been terrified to kind of step outside of that, you know, woke bubble,"" he said.

Over 80% of adults surveyed in a New York Times/Siena College poll in February said they felt it was a serious problem that some Americans wouldn't practice their freedom of speech out of fear of retaliation or harsh criticism. An April Morning Consult poll found that roughly one-third of adults felt they couldn't speak freely on social media.

Fischer also told Fox News he saw a shift once he began making of President Biden's age and low energy.

""I'd make fun of Donald Trump for four years,"" he said while impersonating the former president. ""Then, I made fun of Biden, and they're like, oh, you're far-right.""

NEWSWEEK COLUMN CALLS CHAPPELLE STAND-UP SHOW CANCELLATION ‘A VICTORY FOR CONFORMITY’

""I make fun of who is in power,"" Fischer continued. ""The left has gone so far that now anything sort of nuanced, in the middle, non-censored is considered far-right.""

The Media Research center identified more than 600 instances of social media users facing bans, restrictions or deleted content over posts criticizing Biden between March 2020 and March 2022. The Morning Consult poll found that half of Republicans didn't feel they could speak freely on social media compared to less than 20% of Democrats.

""We have almost this religious crusade now with the political sides over who is right and who is wrong,"" Denny, who has performed stand-up for 17 years, told Fox News.

""Everyone has some line, some sacred cow, that they believe is not okay to make fun of,"" Denny continued. ""And that could be their politics, it could be their religious beliefs, could be any of those things.""

Denny, Fischer and Mayr argued that protecting some groups can actually lead to more exclusion in comedy.

Chappelle has repeatedly faced criticism over his jokes about the transgender community. His Netflix special, ""The Closer,"" led to the tech giant's staff walking out in protest, though CEO Ted Sarandos defended the decision to provide Chappelle with a platform.

""Comedy is like the most inclusive thing,"" Fischer told Fox News. ""You can't slowly start cutting out topics and people that you can't joke about.""

Denny said: ""I will either make fans or not based on the kind of content I do, but I'd rather take the tortoise race to the finish of making the kind of fans I want than just doing what's easy to appease people."""

It was a telling indication of how involved and accessible the casino's next president plans to be.

Hired in June as Hard Rock's general manager, Faranca is being boosted to the top job now that current president Joe Lupo is heading to Las Vegas to run the Mirage casino once the company completes its purchase.

INFLATION CAUSE FOR 'CONCERN' AS TRAVEL-RELATED COSTS SOAR: HARD ROCK INTERNATIONAL CHAIRMAN

He's being handed the city's No. 2 casino in terms of money won from in-person gamblers (No. 3 when internet and sports betting money are included); a resort that has upped the city's game in terms of live entertainment.

But Faranca's gaze extends beyond the casino's walls to the city around it: He's been meeting with city officials on safety and cleanliness initiatives, pledges to continue Hard Rock's history of supporting charitable and community groups, and realizes the casino's success or failure rests squarely on the shoulders of its employees.

That's why late on a busy Saturday night, with a million other things to keep track of, he was huddling with the cleaning staff.

""I make it a point to go to pre-shift meetings with all the different departments, to thank them for what they do and connect with them,"" Faranca said.

A Philadelphia native, Faranca began his casino career in Atlantic City as a guest services manager at Harrah's and the Showboat. He worked in general manager roles at Philadelphia's Parx casino, the Palms in Las Vegas and at Maryland Live!, where he also was executive vice president, before joining Hard Rock.

Faranca says he has five core principles he plans to follow in his new job: Be the employer of choice in your market. Deliver exceptional hospitality. Clearly understand your property's strategy. Focus on the community. Have a commitment from ownership.

The casino is considering doing some hotel room and suite upgrades, and plans to diversify its entertainment lineup even more, he said.

Jim Allen, the global chairman of Hard Rock, has long pushed Atlantic City officials to make the city safer and cleaner, and has not hesitated to call them out when he feels conditions are poor. Faranca has already picked up that baton.

HARD ROCK INTERNATIONAL CHAIRMAN WARNS ECONOMIC CHALLENGES 'IN FRONT OF US ARE REAL'

""I hope everyone rallies behind the idea of a safe and clean Atlantic City,"" he said. ""When guests visit the city, they need a safe visit.""

He has already had discussions with City Councilman Kaleem Shabazz about the need for safety and cleanliness in the city, and will serve on the board of the Atlantic City Police Department Foundation.

""He is very sincere and open to working with government,"" Shabazz said. ""He seems to have a good sense of how a partnership should go and what issues in the community should be dealt with. I feel a strong sense of his community engagement.""

Lupo, the outgoing Hard Rock president, called Faranca ""a great guy, smart, with great experience. I could not be more pleased.""

His advice for his successor?

""Strong leadership is critical,"" Lupo said. ""Follow the direction of CEO Jim Allen, work compassionately and collaboratively with our wonderful Hard Rock team and the Atlantic City community, and even greater success will follow.""

With Hard Rock surging in the market, the question has been raised: Can it surpass the Borgata to become Atlantic City's top-performing casino?

Faranca smiles and refers to his five business principles.

CELEB CHEF GUY FIERI TAKES HIS CHICKEN JOINTS TO COUNTRY MUSIC’S CAPITAL

How much money does Guy Fieri make from television?

Last year, the chef reportedly signed an $80 million contract with the Food Network to host his two shows over the course of a three-year period. The new deal is a $30 million raise from Fieri's prior deal of $50 million, according to Forbes.

Fieri rakes in approximately $26 million per year, which is more than his competitor celebrity chefs such as Emeril Lagasse, who was paid $8 million, and Gordon Ramsay, who earned around $20 million last year. His signature show, ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dive"" first aired in 2006 and, after 33 seasons, earned more than $230 million in advertising revenue in 2020.

""I got a chance of a lifetime,"" Fieri told the Hollywood Reporter in the wake of the deal. ""I think I played it good.""

How did Guy Fieri rise to fame?

The $80 million deal represents a new level of success for Fieri who for most of his career was looked down upon by other celebrity chefs for his humble origins and simple tastes. Fieri started in the food industry at 10 years old and sold pretzels out of a stand. In France, he studied cooking and later moved to Las Vegas to attend the University of Nevada for hospitality management.

In 2006, Fieri was able to host his own show on the Food Network after winning in the second season of ""Next Food Network Star."" The show, ""Guy's Big Bite, only lasted for six episodes and Fieri earned approximately $1,000 per episode.

However, by 2010 the Ohio native was one of the most popular stars on the network when he premiered in Diners, Driven Ins, and Dives. The show follows Fieri on the road across the United States, Canada, and Mexico as he eats unique foods from popular local diners, drive-in restaurants, and dive bars.

By 2019, Fieri, along with the late Julia Child, became the fourth celebrity chef to be awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has been featured in more than 14 series on the Food Network.

How many restaurants does Guy Fieri own?

Fieri, via his company Knuckle Sandwich LLC, recently launched Flavortown Kitchens, a virtual brand with more than 175 locations worldwide, according to the chef's website. Moreover, Fieri owns more than 80 other restaurants under different brands, including Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar and Guy's Burger Joint on Carnival Cruise Lines."

As a parent, you have two main options to help pay for your child’s college expenses: Parent PLUS Loans and private student loans .

The federal government offers Parent PLUS Loans and they come with unique benefits. Private loans come from private lenders, and they may have lower interest rates if you have good credit.

In this article, we’ll go over the main differences between the two types of loans to help you figure out which may be right for you.



Credible lets you compare private student loan rates from multiple lenders, all in one place.

Parent PLUS Loans vs. private parent loans

Both Parent PLUS Loans and private parent loans give you the opportunity to borrow money for your child’s higher education expenses. But they differ significantly in how interest rates are set and how you’ll repay them.

Parent PLUS Loans

The U.S. Department of Education offers Parent PLUS Loans, which are more formally known as Direct PLUS Loans. Graduate or professional students can take these loans out, as well as parents of undergraduate students.

You generally apply for these loans online through the StudentAid.gov website . In most cases, you won’t qualify if you have an adverse credit history, like a bankruptcy or foreclosure in the last five years or a history of late or missed payments.

Parent PLUS Loans have a fixed interest rate set by the federal government, which is currently 7.54%. That means the interest rate won’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You’re able to borrow up to the full cost of attendance, as determined by your child’s school, minus any other financial aid the student receives. When you take out the loan, you’ll also pay a fee of 4.228% of the loan amount. To pay the fee, the government will deduct a portion of the funds from each loan payout.

Private parent loans

Private parent student loans have no standard requirements. Instead, individual lenders set their own qualifications, interest rates, and repayment terms. But in general, lenders determine the interest rate based on your credit score. People with higher credit scores will qualify for lower rates, while people with poor credit will get higher rates, if they qualify.

You may find private parent loans with fixed or variable rates. Variable-rate loans typically begin with a lower APR, but this rate can rise over time. Fixed-rate loans don’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You usually have the option to make full principal and interest payments while your child is in school, or you can make interest-only payments to keep the interest from building up. Most private parent loans must be repaid within 15 years, though loan terms may be shorter depending on the lender.

The best private parent loans feature zero loan fees. Just like with Parent PLUS Loans, you’re solely responsible for repaying a private parent loan.

Cosigned student loans

A third option for helping your child pay for their college education is by cosigning their student loan. When you do this, your child is the primary borrower on the loan but you’re agreeing to be responsible for repaying the loan if your child defaults.

You may consider cosigning a private student loan with your child. In many cases, students aren’t able to qualify for a loan on their own since they may have little or no credit history. By cosigning, lenders take your credit into account as well. Any missed payments will hurt both your credit and your child’s. Many lenders offer a cosigner release option, which allows you to remove yourself from the loan once your child has made a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments.

A cosigner usually isn’t required on federal student loans.

When does it make sense to take out a Parent PLUS Loan?

A Parent PLUS Loan may make the most sense if you have fair credit. With these federal loans, the interest rate is the same no matter your credit score. If you don’t have any major credit problems, but your score simply isn’t the best, you may get a lower rate on a Parent PLUS Loan than you would on a private loan.

A Parent PLUS Loan may also be the best choice if you want to take advantage of one of the unique repayment plans the government offers:

Standard Repayment Plan — This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years.

This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years. Extended Repayment Plan — This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan.

This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan. Graduated Repayment Plan — This plan can help if you expect to have a higher income in the future. Your payments start low, but rise over time. Ideally, your income would grow along with your payment. You also have up to 10 years to repay your loan under this plan.

If your payments are still too high, you may have the option to combine all the Parent PLUS Loans you have into a federal Direct Consolidation Loan, which gives you the option of enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. With these plans, your monthly payment is capped at a certain percentage of your discretionary income. This can be a great option if your discretionary income is relatively low.

When does it make sense to take out a private parent student loan?

If your child has exhausted all their scholarship, grant, and federal loan options, and if you have excellent credit, a private parent student loan may make the most sense. You’ll likely be able to qualify for a lower rate than what you’d receive with a Parent PLUS Loan, saving you money in interest.

Private loans may also make sense if you’d like to choose a variable interest rate. This option gives you a lower initial rate, though it can rise over time. If you expect to pay off the loan quickly, though, you may be able to keep the lower interest rate and pay off the loan before it rises."

Fascination with outer space and space creatures existed long before movie magic and popular culture created ""E.T.,"" ""Star Wars"" or even the ""Alien"" franchise. The final frontier has been a source of endless conspiracy and controversy for decades.

Now, Fox Nation's ""Alien Abductions"" hosted by Abby Hornacek unpacks some of the most legendary alien encounters and introduces people around the country who claim to have been abducted by extraterrestrial beings.

One of the several stories featured in the six-part series that Hornacek traces is the mysterious invention of The Integratron by George Van Tassel, a legendary alien abductee and ufologist who lived in the Mojave Desert in California.



Van Tassel is largely considered to be one of the first contactees with aliens and, in many ways, is said to have kicked off a movement in 1950s America after allegedly encountering an alien from Venus named Solganda.

The new Fox Nation series unpacks Van Tassel's story of meeting Solganda, who supposedly gave extraterrestrial instructions to Van Tassel on how to build an immortality device.

This device became known as The Integratron, which he considered a time machine and a healing device.

While building the 38-feet-tall structure, Van Tassel grew a following he eventually turned into the Church of Universal Wisdom, increasing financial support for his out-of-this-world device.

Wildlife advocates sued federal officials Tuesday after the government missed a deadline to decide if protections for gray wolves should be restored across the northern U.S. Rocky Mountains, where Republican-led states have made it easier to kill the predators.

The Biden administration said in a preliminary finding last September that protections for wolves may need to be restored because increased hunting in Idaho and Montana posed a potential threat to wolves across the region.

A final determination was due June 1.

The Humane Society of the United States and Center for Biological Diversity asked U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy in Montana to order federal officials to make a final decision.

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson Vanessa Kauffman declined comment on the lawsuit and said the agency's review was ongoing.

Wolves were exterminated across most of the U.S. by the 1930s under government-sponsored poisoning and trapping campaigns. They were reintroduced from Canada into the northern U.S. Rockies in the 1990s.

Wilderness areas in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming have since become strongholds for wolf populations. That's helped fuel the species' expansion in recent years into portions of Oregon, Washington state and California.

Republicans governors in Idaho and Montana last year signed laws that expanded when, where and how wolves can be killed.

The Fourteenth Amendment, considered by both scholars and ordinary Americans to be one of the most consequential assurances of civil liberties in U.S. history, was certified as part of the Constitution by Secretary of State William Seward on this date — July 28, 1868.

Congress passed it on June 13 and it was ratified by the requisite 28 of then-37 states on July 9, 1868.

Second, giving up Viktor Bout to the Russians would harm American security.
President Biden must prioritize American interests and security by keeping Viktor Bout in jail.","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

President Joe Biden recently stated that his administration will ""pursue every possible avenue"" to bring U.S. citizens Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan home to the United States. Griner, a women’s basketball star, was sentenced last week by a Russian court to nine years in prison for marijuana possession, a crime in Russia for which she had pleaded guilty. Whelan is serving a 16-year jail term in Russia on espionage charges, accused of receiving and possessing classified information on a USB drive.

Secretary of State Anthony Blinken confirmed on Friday that the United States put forward a ""substantial proposal"" to Putin’s regime for a prisoner exchange, which reportedly would entail releasing Viktor Bout, a dangerous Russian arms trafficker, back to Russia in exchange for Griner and Whelan.

Bad idea.

Here are the top three reasons why this potential deal is not in U.S. interests and should not take place.

BRITTNEY GRINER'S SENTENCE PUTS SPOTLIGHT BACK ON STRAINED US-RUSSIA RELATIONS

First, the deal would embolden Putin to continue using ""hostage diplomacy"" to achieve his anti-American agenda. The Biden administration may bring two Americans home, scoring much needed political points -- at a time the president’s popularity is at historic lows -- but it will endanger many more Americans in the future and harm U.S. security. For years, the Russian government has used prisoner exchanges to retrieve Russian intelligence operatives, cyber criminals, and other types of Russian citizens held in U.S. prisons. Typically, however, the Russians get away with extorting much more valuable Russian nationals, in exchange for ordinary Americans who break Russian law, sometimes unwittingly. The Russians have perfected this playbook.

In April, the Biden administration exchanged a former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed, who was serving a 9-year sentence in a Russian labor camp, after being convicted of assaulting two Russian police officers while drunk on a visit to Moscow. The Russians got back Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot who was arrested by US special forces in 2010 in Liberia and sentenced to 20 years of prison time in US jail in 2011 for conspiring to smuggle more than $100 million worth of cocaine into the United States.

In 2021, the Biden administration quietly deported back to Russia the world’s most dangerous cybercriminal, Alexei Burkov, who had been sentenced to nine years in prison in America. An elite hacker, Burkov operated a website, which sold stolen numbers of credit and debit cards and extorted millions of dollars in ransom from US businesses, in return for unlocking infected computer networks. No Americans appear to have been released by the Russians, and there’s a congressional investigation underway to determine if the Biden Administration got anything in return.

In 2010, the Obama administration released ten Russian spies who had been infiltrated into the United States by Russian intelligence Service, the SVR, ten years earlier. These deep cover agents posed as Americans, blending into regular American day-to-day life, with the goal of penetrating top echelons of U.S. government in order to influence U.S. politics. Some of the sleeper agents in this spy ring got close to infiltrating Hillary Clinton’s circle. The U.S. government did not rescue any Americans out of Russia in exchange for these Russian sleeper agents. Instead, it brought in just four Russian citizens – one nuclear scientist, two intelligence operatives, and one KGB agent – who had been jailed by the Russians for providing secrets to U.S. government.

Second, giving up Viktor Bout to the Russians would harm American security. Bout is not just a regular Russian criminal. He is a high-value asset for the Russians, having ties to Russian spy services and indirect links to Putin himself. Bout is the world’s most prolific international arms trafficker and is serving a 25-year federal sentence for conspiring to kill Americans. This former military intelligence officer was conspiring to sell millions of dollars-worth of weaponry and 10 million rounds of ammunition to a Colombian narco-terrorist organization before he was arrested in a sting operation by U.S. law enforcement officers.

Bout has already spent 15 years in prison and has been thoroughly interrogated by US officers. As a highly trained military intelligence officer, he is also a gifted linguist with command of five languages. Bout undoubtedly has critical insights to share with his former comrades in Russian intelligence about what he experienced in the hands of U.S. debriefers and what was of interest to them.

Bout is connected to a Putin ally, Igor Sechin, who is a former deputy prime minister of Russia and currently the CEO of Rosneft, Russia’s state-owned energy conglomerate. Despite being isolated in a prison cell for over a decade, Bout never gave up his connection the Sechin, a fellow intelligence operative with whom he had served in the Soviet military running operations abroad.

Finally, by giving up Viktor Bout, President Biden would waste millions of dollars from the U.S. intelligence budget and demoralize dozens and possibly hundreds of American law enforcement officers, intelligence analysts, and support personnel who made it possible to capture this criminal. U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) officers finally arrested him in a hotel in Thailand in 2008 after almost a decade-long operation. Similarly, it took ten years of scrupulous work by US counter-intelligence to nab Putin’s spy ring of sleeper agents in 2010. With a stroke of a pen President Biden, and Obama before him, undid all that hard and often dangerous work by U.S. officers.

The Russians are acutely aware of President Biden’s naïveté, weakness, and his self-interest at a time his domestic popularity is at historical lows. They have floated the idea of adding another Russian criminal to the Griner-Whelan-Bout swap – Vadim Krasikov, another Russian spy who was sentenced to life in prison in Germany for having assassinated a former Chechen fighter on German soil.

President Biden must prioritize American interests and security by keeping Viktor Bout in jail."

""Equal Justice Under Law"" is engraved on the ornate pediment above the entrance to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Department of Justice and the FBI continue to hurl eggs at it.

Monday’s pre-dawn raid by a battalion of FBI agents on former President Donald Trump’s Florida home represents an abandonment of the cherished principle embedded in our Constitution that the law will be equally applied to all of its citizens.

Instead, political status now dictates whether a person receives fair treatment in a supposedly fair justice system.

If you check the box marked ""Republican"" on a political affiliation form, brace yourself for persecution and prosecution. If you check ""Democrat,"" you’ll be granted special elevated status. You’re untouchable. Just ask Hillary Clinton and Hunter Biden.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA ‘UNDER SIEGE’ BY FBI AGENTS

The evidence is indisputable that Clinton, while serving as secretary of State, converted tens of thousands of government records to her private email server in the basement of her home. In simple terms, she was stealing. She committed at least 110 crimes under the Espionage Act, representing the number of documents that the FBI determined were classified and top secret. She jeopardized America’s national security by exposing vital secrets to our enemies. The State Department discovered her computer was successfully hacked.

But that’s not all. When Congress instructed Clinton to preserve all of her documents, she destroyed more than 30,000 of them while wiping her server clean by using file-deleting software. Her mobile devices were broken in half or demolished with hammers. Her willful destruction of government property constituted another set of crimes, including obstruction.

Did the FBI ever raid Clinton’s home in Chappaqua, New York, to seize the incriminating evidence she kept there? No. Just the opposite occurred. Without authority, then-FBI Director James Comey absolved Clinton despite overwhelming evidence of criminality that he spelled out in his infamous July 5, 2016, news conference.

Months later, when Comey was fired for usurping the power of the attorney general, he stole government documents from the FBI. He did it for the admitted purpose of leaking them to the media to trigger the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Trump over phony allegations of Russian ""collusion"" that Hillary invented and the FBI exploited. We know how that capacious witch hunt turned out.

Did the FBI ever raid Comey’s home to retrieve the documents he pilfered? Did the DOJ charge him with theft of government property? Of course not. Don’t be silly.

This brings us to Hunter Biden. His notorious laptop contains a trove of damning documents and emails that offer compelling evidence of multiple enrichment schemes with foreign entities that forked over millions of dollars for access to Joe Biden and the power he wielded as vice president. Instead of a multiple count indictment for influence peddling, money laundering, tax fraud and foreign lobbying crimes, a four-year investigation has produced nothing.

RAID ON TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO HOME BY BIDEN'S POLITICIZED FBI MEANS US NOW A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY

Did the FBI ever raid Hunter’s home to obtain additional evidence? Or Joe Biden’s home, since the laptop implicates him as involved in his son’s profiteering scams? You know the answer. Don’t be dense.

The FBI doesn’t abide by the law when Democrats are involved. The agency obstructs it. They’re running a protection racket for the Bidens.

Recently we learned that ""highly credible whistleblowers"" within the bureau exposed an internal ""scheme"" by senior officials to bury evidence of Hunter’s corruption by falsely portraying the laptop’s contents as ""disinformation"" from foreign intelligence sources. Those same officials then allegedly sealed the truth in a file that only they could access.

Don’t forget – the FBI had the computer in its possession since December 2019 and knew it was real. The contents were fully analyzed and overflowing with evidence of influence peddling. But the agency and the Justice Department kept it under wraps, taking no action to charge or prosecute.

Ten months later when news of the laptop broke, 51 former intelligence agents publicly bashed it as Russian disinformation. The FBI knew it was a lie that the bureau helped invent. So, officials remained mute to help Biden get elected.

FBI Director Christopher Wray has done nothing to clean up his cesspool of an agency. He seems more interested in covering up acts of malfeasance and misfeasance. But the FBI is not alone in abusing its powers to protect partisan allies and punish political adversaries. The whistleblowers have also identified a top official within Merrick Garland’s Justice Department who has done the same.

The attorney general, who was appointed by Biden, is overseeing the investigation of his boss’ son. To the extent that the president was a participant and beneficiary in Hunter’s schemes, Garland has a disqualifying double conflict of interest. Yet, he has refused to appoint a neutral special counsel even though it is mandatory under federal regulations.

Garland despises Republicans for denying him a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. Covering up for a Democratic president is his vengeance. He’s the attorney general in name only. Like Robert Duvall’s character in ""The Godfather,"" Garland serves as Biden’s ""consigliere."" He’s Joe’s protector, by hook or by crook.

""There are some areas, St. Paul in particular, [where] they’re a little judgmental,"" he said.

Barnes said, ""I don’t want to bash everybody else, because I was treated really well by a lot of other people. So that’s why I’m saying it’s inconsistent.""

""The only thing consistent about Minnesota is the terrain,"" he added. ""It’s been really easy to travel out here.""

""I was disappointed in Saint Paul,"" Barnes later added.

At a laundromat where he was washing and drying his clothes and shoes, a woman approached him and ""demanded that I put my shoes on,"" Barnes said.

""It was just a simple interaction — but those are the things that I base all my observations on,"" Barnes said.

‘Easy miles’

Barnes said that after he left St. Paul, everything changed for him about 30 miles outside the city.

""Here I am with my head down. I’m feeling dejected,"" he said, describing his mood at that time.

""And now, people are starting to come up to me, all talkative and inquisitive with a whole different vibe. It was really weird.""

""The people up there were actually more … inquisitive than anywhere else,"" Barnes added.

""There were so many cyclists and everybody just, one after the other, pulled up from behind me and just, ‘Oh, where are you going, what are you doing?’ And we’d stop and talk and that turned me around back to being in a good mood.""

""When you’re with somebody, they’re easy miles,"" Barnes said. ""It’s easy to pedal. You don’t realize you’re pedaling. You’re just having a conversation and moving along nice.""

Major milestone for this cyclist

While in Minnesota, Barnes reached another milestone: crossing the Mississippi River one last time.

Barnes ended up crossing the Mississippi River a total of nine times on his trip, which began back on Aug. 1, 2021 — a year ago.

""It’s actually pretty cool,"" Barnes said. ""To cross the Mississippi River nine times on nine different bridges on one trip is fun.""

Staying in a casino

During one of his last nights in Minnesota, a follower of Barnes gifted him a room stay at a casino resort.

The follower works as a security guard at the casino and offered Barnes a $25 voucher for dinner along with his room.

""The casino — that was terrific,"" Barnes said. ""That’s kind of like what I needed.""

""The only thing I gambled was — they give you a card with $5 on it that I turned into $11 and then spent it.""

He added, ""But I don’t gamble. I feel too guilty if I gamble.""

What Barnes said he enjoyed the most at the casino was getting to mingle with other people.

Next stop: South Dakota

When Barnes spoke with Fox News Digital about Minnesota in May, he had about 3,100 miles left on his trip. ""It’s counting down. It’s really good,"" Barnes said. ""It’s a really good feeling right now.""

After he left Minnesota on May 24, Barnes headed to capital 43 on his trip: Pierre, South Dakota.

After he visited each of the Lower 48 states, Barnes took a ferry to Juneau, Alaska, from Canada and rode on his bicycle to the capitol — as he explained early on that he would be doing.

A Virginia-based disaster relief and humanitarian aid organization traveled to eastern Kentucky over the weekend to cook and deliver hot meals to those in need following last week's deadly flash flooding.

Mercy Chefs — founded by longtime chef Gary LeBlanc — has been serving millions of chef-prepared meals during national emergencies and natural disasters since the aftermath of Katrina in 2006.

Their efforts began just days after Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear issued a state of emergency due to the severe flooding that killed dozens and displaced many others.

After the team arrived in Whitesburg on Saturday, they heard stories of families who were thankful to be alive after nearly being swept away in the devastating floods.

Beshear said on Monday that the death toll climbed to 30 following the storms, flooding and mudslides that began early last week. He also noted that the death toll would likely increase as search and rescue operations continued.

Some people stranded on rooftops are still waiting to be rescued, and more than 23,000 households are currently without power, Beshear said in an update about the catastrophic flooding.

""Over the last few days, Eastern Kentucky communities faced the most destructive flooding in the state’s history,"" Mercy Chefs Facebook post read. ""The death toll continues to rise as search and rescue teams continue their work, and now there is more rain in the forecast this week.""

Mercy Chefs and its band of more than 25 volunteers have already served nearly 2,000 hot meals to victims and first responders on Sunday after setting up at Letcher County Central High School.

The team plans to serve hot lunches and dinner at the high school as well as distribute meals to multiple rural locations.

""It’s times like this that we feel so blessed to have bases strategically placed across the country,"" said LeBlanc.

For the last 16 years, LeBlanc and his team at Mercy Chefs have traveled to more than 150 disaster zones in 29 states and 12 countries.

The Jeep Renegade is built in Italy.

And the Ford EcoSport took the long journey from India to showrooms before it was discontinued this year.

But there are also plenty of cars that are made in the USA that might not be so obvious.

Here are a few that are hiding in plain sight:

SUBARU OUTBACK

It may have an Australian name and come from a Japanese company, but the Subaru Outback is built right in the heartland in Lafayette, Indiana, alongside the Ascent, Legacy and Impreza.

The Outback is the brand's best-selling car so far in 2022.

ACURA NSX

The Acura NSX has the sleek lines and technology of an exotic machine, but the mid-engine hybrid sports car was designed in the USA and has been built at Honda's Performance Manufacturing Center in Marysville, Ohio since 2016.

Olivia Newton-John’s only daughter is mourning the loss of the beloved singer.



The Grammy-winning superstar passed away on Monday at her southern California ranch, her husband John Easterling confirmed on Instagram and Facebook. She was 73.



Chloe Lattanzi also took to social media, where she shared a series of sweet photos featuring herself and the late ""Grease"" star from over the years. One of the heartfelt snapshots was a smiling selfie of mother and daughter.



While the post wasn’t captioned, the 36-year-old shared a photo of the pair just three days ago. Newton-John is seen beaming as she stands proudly next to her daughter.

""I worship this woman,"" Lattanzi captioned that post. ""My mother. My best friend.""



In May 2017, Newton-John revealed that she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her back. In 2021, she described how Lattanzi was been by her side.



""I’m so lucky to still be doing all these things,"" Newton-John told People magazine about attending Lattanzi’s wedding and releasing a single with her called ""Window in the Wall.""



""I don’t think I imagined living this long!"" she said. ""I feel very blessed.""

The outlet revealed that while both women have always been close, their bond only grew stronger while they quarantined in California together during the coronavirus pandemic. While Lattanzi later moved to Portland, Oregon, she revealed in late July that she had moved back to be near her mother.



""I worked my whole life, and the longest period I can remember being home was my pregnancy with Chloe and the first year or two of her life,"" Newton-John reflected. ""So it’s been wonderful reconnecting with my baby. She is my reason to be.""



In 2016, Lattanzi opened up to the outlet about what it was like growing up with Newton-John.



""As a kid, I wasn’t paying attention to her as a celebrity,"" she explained. ""She’s my mom, you know? Like, she takes me to school. I think as I’ve gotten older, that’s when I got to listening to her music. I did a re-imagining of ‘Magic’ because I loved it so much.""

From 1973 to 1983, Newton-John was among the world’s most popular entertainers. She had 14 top 10 singles just in the U.S., won four Grammys, starred with John Travolta in ""Grease"" and with Gene Kelly in ""Xanadu."" The fast-stepping Travolta-Newton-John duet, ""You’re the One That I Want,"" was one of the era’s biggest songs and has sold more than 15 million copies.



""Physical,"" the bouncy, R-rated smash released in 1981, was No. 1 for 10 weeks and was named Billboard’s song of the year despite being banned by some radio stations. An aerobics-friendly promotional clip, filmed in the early years of MTV, won a Grammy for best video.



Newton-John’s recent albums included ""Stronger Than Before,"" holiday collaboration with Travolta ""This Christmas,"" and the autobiographical ""Gaia: One Woman’s Journey,"" inspired by her battle with cancer and by the loss of her father.

Caregiver burnout is a significant concern, say health experts — and some states are now stepping up to offer online support to family members for free.

The New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA) and the Association on Aging in New York (AgingNY) recently announced a partnership with Trualta, a company that provides web-based educational skills training and a support platform.

The partnership supports those who are caring for their aging family members or friends at home.

The loved ones may suffer from conditions ranging from Alzheimer’s and dementia to developmental disabilities, stroke recovery, diabetes and more.

COGNITIVE DECLINE CAN BE AVOIDED WITH SIMPLE, EVERYDAY EXERCISES, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS

The platform also addresses caregiver wellness — and how to help a person transition from the hospital to home, a spokesperson for Trualta told Fox News Digital.

The initiative comes at no cost to residents of New York State who are providing unpaid care to a family member or friend, according to a news release from the New York State Office of the Aging.

New York joins five other states that are offering no-cost virtual help to individuals who are providing unpaid care to family members or friends in those states.

North Carolina, Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin and New Hampshire currently offer the online platform statewide to residents free of charge.

The Trualta program is also available free of charge in certain parts of 27 other states thanks to counties, state providers and community-based organizations, a spokesperson for the company told Fox News Digital.

There are efforts underway to make it available across all 50 states.

‘A big flip’

Caregiver Leda Rosenthal told Fox News Digital that she was 19 years old when her mother was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s disease at age 57.

""It was a big flip from being the one who was being taken care of to being the one who is taking care of my mom,"" said Rosenthal.

She described the difficult journey a person faces when taking on the caregiver role of a family member.

""Different challenges started popping up,"" she said.

She noted that her mom ""would wander. We have two big dogs, so she would get lost with them in the neighborhood.""

She also said her mom would leave the stove on by accident.

""Caregivers already feel socially isolated — and when the pandemic hit, this just made it hard to connect with others.""

Rosenthal told Fox News Digital the most taxing situation for her was the behavioral challenges in her mother that she experienced.

""My mom’s agitation, her anxiety — she started to have hallucinations as well,"" said Rosenthal.

MASSACHUSETTS MOM IS HONORED BY HER GROWN KIDS IN PICTURE-PERFECT PORTRAITS

She said she searched the web for hours at a time to try to find ways of successfully communicating with her mom.

""You get lots of misinformation online,"" she told Fox Digital News.

Aside from experiencing the behavioral issues of their loved ones, Rosenthal said there is the social isolation aspect of the work they do.

""Caregivers already feel socially isolated — and when the pandemic hit, this just made it hard to connect with others,"" she said.

Rosenthal decided to use her technology skills and personal situation to create a career path to help those who are aging remain at home, while also supporting those who care for them.

Caregivers can type in the scenario or symptom they're dealing with — and a selection of skills training information is offered.

She eventually met with Jonathan Davis, the CEO of Trualta, which is headquartered in St. Joseph, Missouri — and became the director of growth for the company.

Rosenthal described the website as offering a menu of options.

Instead of selecting a movie genre from a menu of movies, for example, caregivers can type in a scenario or symptom they might be dealing with — and a selection of skills training information will be offered.

You might say, for example, ""that your loved one is wandering,"" she said.

Then, you might be provided with ""steps to reduce wandering, broken up by different tasks,"" said Rosenthal in describing the specific tips offered.

While caregivers may not need to understand the science behind their loved one’s disease, they do need to learn coping skills in dealing with the challenges the disease creates for the person they're taking care of, said Rosenthal.

""What’s important as a caregiver is how you can respond to create a better experience for your loved one and for yourself to reduce your burnout.""

Caregivers, she said, ""don't know what skills go into agitation — but they know the problem that they are having.""

Rosenthal said that ""what’s important as a caregiver is how you can respond to create a better experience for your loved one and for yourself to reduce your burnout.""

CAREGIVER FATIGUE IN AMERICA IS RISING AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE: REPORTS

Joel Salinas, assistant professor of neurology in the Department of Neurology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told Fox News Digital, ""A diagnosis of dementia is not just a diagnosis for the patient — it’s also a diagnosis for the patient’s family and whoever else will be providing informal caregiving.""

He said as well, ""Caregiving can add a significant stress on the ability to participate in work and self-care — and there is also a great deal of uncertainty about so many aspects of care and what to expect. There are serious health and economic impacts from this kind of caregiving, so seeking support early and consistently can be critical.""

A Trualta spokesperson said the e-platform provides adult learners with the ability to scan and find answers quickly from evidence-based sourcing.

A study published in 2021 in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports found that 84.4% of participants who accessed the Trualta platform reported using skills they learned via the online platform.

The study also found that skills pertaining to behavioral management were reportedly used the most (60%) — while over half the caregivers reported allocating more time for self-care.

There are reportedly more than four million caregivers in New York State who provide nearly 2.7 billion hours of unpaid care.

Caregiver burden scores also appeared to decrease after people used Trualta for 30 days, according to the study.

The study's authors said in the peer-reviewed published report, ""This highlights the potential for online interventions to help informal caregivers access valuable techniques they can apply in their daily life.""

Rosenthal, commenting on that study, told Fox News Digital that ""when the caregivers are offered access to Trualta, in just 30 days we see the following: a 12% decrease in behavioral symptom severity, a 10% decrease in distress and a 30% improvement in caregiver fulfillment.""

A previous study also showed that when a family member is trained in caring for a loved one at home, that training may lead to reduced hospitalizations for the loved one.

Rosenthal said that when a family member receives training in prevention and in recognizing different signs and symptoms of conditions, for example — such as urinary tract infections — earlier treatment can be given.

Sixty-one percent of those caregivers worry about caring for a loved one, the news release said, while 70 percent reported experiencing at least one mental health symptom during the pandemic.

Jonathan Davis, CEO of Trualta, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that many caregivers have no prior experience and don’t know where to turn for help.

Talk about pedaling with purpose!

The Pan-Massachusetts Challenge (PMC), a two-day charity bicycle ride across the Bay State, is on the cusp of contributing an incredible $1 billion to the fight against cancer ever since its inception in 1980.

The 2022 PMC hits the streets this weekend (Aug. 6-7) with thousands of amateur bicyclists pedaling across cities, down back country roads and past Cape Cod National Seashore to raise money for the Jimmy Fund at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

Organizers hope to raise and donate $66 million this weekend alone.

The PMC has donated $831 million to Dana-Farber since its founding 42 years ago. Organizers anticipate topping $1 billion in donations by 2024.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO FOUNDED THE STURGIS MOTORCYCLE RALLY, ‘PUT THE BROTHERHOOD IN MOTORCYCLES’

The PMC is a tribute to the power of the human spirit to take pain and turn it into progress.

Founder Billy Starr, a native of Newton, Mass., west of Boston, launched the event in 1980.

He pedaled across the commonwealth with 35 friends, after watching three relatives, including his mother, succumb to cancer in the 1970s.

Betty Starr was just 49 years old.

""The PMC was not a career plan,"" Starr told Fox News Digital. ""But it was something I needed to do. I saw an opportunity to do something good. It lit me up.""

Thousands of other cyclists are lit up as well by the event each year.

Many describe the charity ride as a spiritual experience: two days spinning past the New England countryside in the hot summer sun, at times pedaling in pain or on the verge of quitting, the whir of bicycle gears often the only sound with thousands of others united in common purpose.

""The PMC is the single largest contributor to Dana-Farber and the Jimmy Fund and is responsible for 55 percent of the Jimmy Fund’s annual revenue,"" the PMC proclaims on its website.

Every rider dollar raised goes to Dana-Farber. The event's entire operational budget is funded by corporate largesse.

IN CAPE COD COMMUNITY, TRUE-CRIME AUTHORS CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT A TRUE CRIME THERE

The ride’s signature 212-mile route is a two-day ride from the hills of Sturbridge in Central Mass. to the sand dunes of Provincetown at the far tip of Cape Cod.

The PMC is supported by thousands of volunteers who do everything from make sandwiches at water stops to load rider luggage on trucks destined for Provincetown.

Countless thousands of Massachusetts residents and visitors line the road to cheer riders along the flagship route and the PMC's many secondary routes.

Starr and his team of 36 pedal partners raised a mere $10,000 in 1980.



But the original riders felt they had done something special. Many of those cyclists have returned each year since.

""Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong that year,"" said Starr. ""Yet everyone thought that it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.""

The ride has only grown since, which Starr pushing harder and demanding more from fundraisers and corporate sponsors each year.

She shared an image of Alec on bended knee in a chapel, likely the Basilica of St. Patrick's Old Cathedral in New York where they were married a decade ago.

""10 years packed full of so many babies, laughs, tears, frustration, breakthroughs, passion, fear, joy…and everything all in between that our life brings. Happy anniversary Alec,"" she wrote.

Police are investigating Anne Heche for driving under the influence after she crashed her car into a home in Los Angeles on Friday.

The crash ignited a fire and almost destroyed the Mar Vista home.

Julia Jayne, founder of Jayne Law Group, P.C., explained to Fox News Digital that Heche would be charged in the crash, even if she wasn't under the influence.

""She's going to get charged,"" Jayne said. ""They're going to try to charge her with something for that. Reckless driving at a minimum, if she's got no alcohol in her system.""

ANNE HECHE IN A COMA FOLLOWING CAR CRASH: SHE HAS NOT 'REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS,' REP SAYS

Legal experts previously told Fox News Digital that Heche could be charged with reckless driving, hit-and-run and potentially DUI.

A public information officer for the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to Fox News Digital that authorities obtained a warrant for a sample of Heche's blood on Aug. 5.

The results of the blood test are pending and the investigation ongoing. If Heche is found to have been intoxicated during the crash, she will be charged with a DUI hit-and-run, LAPD told Fox News Digital. Authorities will then present the case to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office.

If drugs are detected in the LAPD's initial toxicology screen, authorities will have to run a confirmatory test to decide what level of drug was in Heche's system. This secondary toxicology report could take up to 30 days, according to a representative for the Los Angeles Police Department.

Jayne, a criminal defense attorney, told Fox News Digital that police taking time to investigate driving under the influence isn't ""unique"" to Heche's crash.

""If there's time, send it to the lab,"" she said. ""Get the blood test results, because also there are certain enhancements that they might want to charge depending on what the blood alcohol level is. So, it makes sense that they would do that investigation, not unique to her in any DUI case.""

Jayne explained that if the blood sample was taken within three hours of Heche's crash, the blood sample would be considered ""reliable for the time of driving.""

""They probably took it within that time, and that gives them some confidence,"" she said.

The ""Donnie Brasco"" actress is in ""extreme critical condition"" after the crash, a representative for the actress told Fox News Digital on Monday.

""She has a significant pulmonary injury requiring mechanical ventilation and burns that require surgical intervention,"" the rep said. ""She is in a coma and has not regained consciousness since shortly after the accident.""

Heche's rep shared on Saturday that she was in ""stable condition,"" noting that the actress' ""family and friends ask for your thoughts and prayers and to respect her privacy during this difficult time.""

Heche's ex-boyfriend, Thomas Jane, previously told the Daily Mail that the actress is ""expected to pull through.""

The actress crashed her Mini Cooper twice on Friday, with the second crash igniting a fire that left a home almost destroyed in the Mar Vista neighborhood.

Heche suffered burn injuries but was ""conscious and breathing"" when paramedics removed her from the vehicle.

It's unclear when the results of her toxicology report will be returned to authorities.

LeBron James aims to give students at his I Promise School opportunities they may not have otherwise.

Recently, the NBA superstar's mission shifted into another gear.

James Bromsey III, a sixth-grader at James' school in Akron, Ohio, was given behind-the-scenes access before NASCAR’s race Sunday at Michigan International Speedway.

It was a fitting way to celebrate a student, whose father died four years ago. James Bromsey II shared a dream with family and friends that his son would be in the Akron Soap Box Derby, an event that dates to 1934.

NASCAR REVEALS WHY DENNY HAMLIN'S POCONO-WINNING CAR WAS DISQUALIFIED

""My son was six months old when his dad said he was going to be in the soap box derby,"" Tomika Pope recalled.

Bromsey fulfilled a promise to participate in the event in June. He was awarded a VIP experience by Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing, which put a paint job on Chris Buescher's No. 17 Ford to include logos, colors and words associated with the LeBron James Family Foundation.

Bromsey rode in a pace car, climbed up the spotter's stand and had a meet-and-greet session with Buescher.

""When did you do your first flip? he asked Buescher, who said he had not flipped, but did recently have his car catch on fire. Buescher went on to tell his guests that his dad got him started in racing.

SHOCK: NASCAR LAUNCHING ELECTRIC RACING SERIES IN 2023, LEAKED DOCUMENTS SAY

""Dad was into racing, too,"" Bromsey said quietly.

During a tour of RFK's hauler, which included a peek through an overhead opening at the space where the team stores its two cars, Bromsey's aunt Tracy Gholston was almost brought to tears. Gholston said her brother died in 2018, shortly after a bout with pneumonia.

""He could have led this tour,"" she said, choking up. ""It’s so emotional to see how God put this all together.""

Bromsey added: ""He would be telling you everything about all the cars.""

Bromsey also was given access to the garage area, where he posed for pictures and pointed toward the I Promise School logo on Buescher's car. He later walked behind the Mustang as it was pushed to the track and watched as Buescher finished 16th in the 37-car race won by Kevin Harvick in the No. 4 Ford.

James is a minority owner in Fenway Sports Group, a parent company of RFK Racing. He opened the I Promise School, which is at full capacity with third to eighth-graders, four years ago in a partnership with his family foundation and Akron City Schools, aiming to support kids facing the same problems he had during a challenging childhood.

DANICA PATRICK TALKS INDY 500, BRISTOL AND RICKY STENHOUSE JR.

Before the race, James wished Buescher luck on Twitter and celebrated Bromsey's experience.

""For James to have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity at the track is amazing,"" James said. ""He’s an incredible kid with a love for racing. We wanted to show him that anything is possible when you go out and chase your dreams. And with the No. 17 car representing all of us, we want all the kids from Akron to know that nothing is out of reach for them.""

Did a day at the track inspire Bromsey to someday become a NASCAR driver?

""I'll stick to the soap box derby,"" he said, with a grin."

New York Jets offensive lineman Mekhi Becton will ""more than likely"" miss the entire 2022 season after suffering a significant knee injury during training camp on Monday, head coach Robert Saleh revealed Tuesday.

Saleh said the 2020 first-round pick will be going for a second opinion on Wednesday to assess the injury to his right knee. According to ESPN, he suffered a fractured kneecap.

The 6-foot-7 lineman, who was rumored to have hit 400 pounds last season, was run-blocking at right tackle on the second play of team drills when he went down on the grass and immediately grabbed at his knee.

Becton was down for a few moments before trying to get up and needed assistance from trainers to walk off the field.

Saleh, anticipating the media and fan storm that would soon follow, defended Becton and his work ethic.

Cash advance loans differ from payday loans in some important ways, though.
Why you should avoid them: Cash advance loans are still significantly more expensive than traditional personal loans, or even credit cards.
Because of this added protection, lenders often have lower credit score requirements for secured loans and may even approve borrowers with a bad credit score.","Our goal here at Credible Operations, Inc., NMLS Number 1681276, referred to as ""Credible"" below, is to give you the tools and confidence you need to improve your finances. Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

Getting a personal loan can be difficult if you have a limited credit history or bad credit. Some lenders that target bad credit borrowers promise no credit check and fast funding. But these loans often come with expensive fees that can trap you in a cycle of debt.

If you’re struggling to choose the right personal loan — or finding it flat-out impossible — you may start to feel discouraged. Before you settle for an expensive loan product, though, here are some bad credit loans that you should avoid — whether you just need a few hundred dollars, want a $10,000 loan , or anything in between.



Credible makes it easy to see your prequalified personal loan rates from various lenders, all in one place.

1. Payday loans

A payday loan is a small, short-term loan intended to tide you over with an advance until your next payday. Storefront payday lenders typically offer these loans, but you may also find them online. Depending on your state, there may also be a maximum borrowing limit, often $500 or less. Lenders usually require borrowers to repay these loans in two to four weeks’ time, in one lump sum, plus fees.

If you’re struggling to make ends meet before your paycheck hits, this can seem like an enticing loan option, especially if you need same-day funds .

Why you should avoid them: Most payday loan lenders don’t have strict credit- or income-based qualifications, so they often loan money to people who may struggle to repay the debt . Additionally, these loans are notoriously expensive. While most states cap the interest that can be charged per $100 borrowed, this is usually in the range of $10 to $30.

While that may not sound like too much, when you consider the length of the loan term and the low borrowing limits, these fees work out to an astronomical APR. For example, a $100 payday loan with a two-week repayment term and a $15 fee equates to an APR of nearly 400%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

Compare that to the average interest rate on a 24-month personal loan — 8.73% in May 2022, according to the Federal Reserve — and it’s easy to see what a ""deal"" payday loans really work out to be.

2. Cash advance loans

A cash advance loan is similar to a payday loan, in that you can use its short-term funds to help you cover immediate or unexpected expenses. These loans can even be funded as quickly as the same day, depending on the lender.

Cash advance loans differ from payday loans in some important ways, though. For starters, you can usually borrow a lot more with a cash advance loan, with some lenders offering as much as $5,000. You don’t always have to repay a cash advance loan in just a few weeks, either; you may be able to take out a cash advance that you can repay in monthly installments.

Why you should avoid them: Cash advance loans are still significantly more expensive than traditional personal loans, or even credit cards. Depending on the lender, your cash advance loan could have an APR of 299% or more.

3. Car title loans

If you have bad credit and need to borrow money, using your vehicle as collateral to get a car title loan could be one option. But car title loans aren’t a good choice for most borrowers.

Title loans often have repayment terms as short as 30 days, though you might find installment options as long as 24 months. The amount you can borrow depends on your location, as well as the value of your vehicle — as long as you own your vehicle free and clear.

Why you should avoid them: The downside? You probably already guessed it: You’ll pay significantly more in interest with a title loan than with a traditional personal loan. It’s not uncommon for car title loans to have APRs in the triple digits.

More than that, though, you’re securing the loan with one of your most important assets: your car. If you were to default on your title loan, the lender could take ownership of your vehicle.

4. Pawn shop loans

A pawn shop loan is a short-term loan that’s secured by something you own, such as jewelry or other valuables. These loans typically allow you to access money quickly, depending on how much your valuables are worth.

Pawn shop lenders typically don’t run a credit check, so these loans can seem like a good option for borrowers with poor credit or those looking for a no-credit-check loan . The pawn shop will usually offer a percentage of the pawned item’s value in loan form. You’ll need to repay the loan by an agreed-upon date, or the shop keeps the item.

Why you should avoid them: If you repay the loan as agreed, you can get your valuables back. But your pawn shop loan will have accrued interest in the interim, which you’ll also need to pay. These loans also tend to have a variety of fees tacked on, such as storage, setup, and even appraisal fees. For this reason, a lower interest rate can be deceptive, as the loan will actually end up costing you considerably more in the end.

Try a personal loan instead

If you need funds for an unexpected expense, large purchase, or even to refinance high-interest debt, a traditional personal loan is often your best bet — even if you have bad credit. Here are some things you can do to increase your chances of qualifying for one:

Apply with a cosigner. Adding a cosigner with good credit to your personal loan application may be the answer to getting approved or snagging better interest rates. Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit.

Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit. Check your credit reports. If your low credit score is keeping you from getting a personal loan, it’s important to understand why. Check your credit reports to see what sort of negative items are bringing down your score. In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected.

In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected. Consider a secured personal loan. A secured loan uses one or more of your assets as collateral for the debt. Because of this added protection, lenders often have lower credit score requirements for secured loans and may even approve borrowers with a bad credit score. Some financial institutions might not even require a minimum credit score at all, as long as you’re securing the loan with an asset. But keep in mind that if you fall behind on your loan payments, the lender can take your collateral."

WHAT IS CASH-OUT REFINANCING AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

How mortgage rates have changed over time

Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac — 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates.

If you’re ready to take advantage of current mortgage refinance rates that are below average historical lows, you can use Credible to check rates from multiple lenders .

How to get your lowest mortgage refinance rate

If you’re interested in refinancing your mortgage, improving your credit score and paying down any other debt could secure you a lower rate . It’s also a good idea to compare rates from different lenders if you're hoping to refinance so you can find the best rate for your situation.

Borrowers can save $1,500 on average over the life of their loan by shopping for just one additional rate quote, and an average of $3,000 by comparing five rate quotes, according to research from Freddie Mac .

Be sure to shop around and compare current mortgage rates from multiple mortgage lenders if you decide to refinance your mortgage. You can do this easily with Credible's free online tool and see your prequalified rates in only three minutes.

How does Credible calculate refinance rates?

Changing economic conditions, central bank policy decisions, investor sentiment and other factors influence the movement of mortgage refinance rates. Credible average mortgage refinance rates reported in this article are calculated based on information provided by partner lenders who pay compensation to Credible.

The rates assume a borrower has a 740 credit score and is borrowing a conventional loan for a single-family home that will be their primary residence. The rates also assume no (or very low) discount points and a down payment of 20%.

When is it worth it to refinance?

Refinancing a mortgage can be a great way to save money. But it’s not always the best move for every homeowner.

People refinance for a number of reasons, including to get a lower interest rate, change their monthly payment amount and lower their interest costs. Generally, if you can lower your interest rate by at least 0.75%, refinancing might be a good move.

But before you refinance, be sure to weigh closing costs, and calculate how long it will take before your savings from the refinance cover the expenses of refinancing.

What is a good mortgage rate?

Generally, a good mortgage rate is one that’s the lowest you can qualify for based on your individual factors, such as credit history, income, other debts, down payment amount, and more.

A rate that’s good for your financial situation should result in a monthly mortgage payment that you can manage, while leaving plenty of room in your monthly budget to put toward savings, investments, and an emergency fund. And a good rate should be competitive with average rates in the geographic area where you’re looking to buy.

PRIVACY TIP: 5 WAYS YOU'RE BEING TRACKED YOU MUST STOP RIGHT NOW

Start with the outside

Keeping your phone clean isn’t hard with the right supplies and a little bit of elbow grease. Set down the paper towels and follow these simple steps for cleaning your screen, ports, and case.

Cleaning the screen

First, remove your phone’s case and accessories. You want to reach every nook and cranny.

A microfiber cloth works for wiping away smudges and grease, but I prefer screen cleaning wipes designed for smartphones. They’re just so easy. Skip paper towels. They’re too rough for delicate jobs like this.

I have purchased this 210-pack of screen cleaning wipes from Care Touch time and time again. Use them on smartphones, tablets, monitors, TVs, and remote controls. They’re scratch-free and made with anti-static tissue that cleans without leaving behind streaks or lint.

Don’t forget the ports

Your phone's ports collect dust, grime, and dirt. Avoid using cotton swabs, which leave behind fuzz and could leave you worse off than when you started. Toothpicks can work if you are very gentle, but breaking off the sharp end inside a port is easy.

I prefer tools made for the job. It helps that these are cheap.

This Skylety 17-piece phone cleaning kit is under $10. The kit includes anti-static brushes, nylon brushes, cleaning cloths and a de-dusting film. You can use them to clear the gunk out of your ports gently.

Scrub your case

If you keep your phone in a case, I bet you’re shocked every time you take it off and see all the grime collected inside it. You don’t need to be quite as careful with your case as your phone's screen and ports.

For plastic, rubber, and silicone cases, grab an old toothbrush and a bit of warm, soapy water. Use the toothbrush to reach all the corners and crevices. Rinse it thoroughly.

Very lightly dampen a microfiber cloth with water and a mild soap for leather cases. Lightly rub the case in circular motions.

After it’s clean, let your case dry thoroughly before you put it back on. Need case recommendations? I share some here, along with my favorite screen protector . This has saved me from cracking my iPhone several times.

Now that your phone is bright and shiny on the outside, let's dive into the inside.

Make your phone faster and more secure

Cookies, location services, and ad networks can slow you down and even pose privacy and security risks. It only takes a few minutes to clear out the junk bogging you down.

Delete apps you don’t use anymore

It's smart to inventory what apps are on your phone now and then. Delete what you don't use regularly. Delete or close down the account associated with the app before you remove it. Tap or click here for steps to do that the right way .

You can also take care of that on your computer. This digital tool shows you the best ways to delete unwanted accounts from almost every online service. Tap or click here to see how to delete your unwanted accounts.

On Android gadgets, go to Settings, then tap Apps. A list of the apps on your phone will appear. Select the app you want to delete and tap Uninstall. (Note: Your exact steps may differ depending on the device's manufacturer.)

Check your permissions

Most apps on your phone collect info to learn more about you. This data can be used for targeted advertisements, marketing, and improvements to systems like search engines and voice assistants.

Give your phone a privacy checkup by reviewing the permissions you’ve given your apps. You might be surprised at which ones use your camera, microphone, or location data.

On your iPhone:

Open the Settings app. Scroll down and tap the Privacy icon.

To delete the cache from your iPhone’s Safari browser, follow these steps below:

Open Settings, scroll down and select Safari.

Under the Privacy & Security section, tap Clear History and Website Data. This will remove browsing history, cookies, and other site data.

You can clear the cache from other apps, too. Tap Settings, General and iPhone storage, and scroll through your apps. They are listed by the amount of space they take from most to least.

If an app uses a ton of space, like more than 500MB, it's a good idea to uninstall and reinstall it later. You won't lose any personal information, but you may need to re-enter your login details.

To delete the cache from the Chrome browser on an Android phone, follow these steps below:

Open Chrome.

At the top right, tap the three-dot icon.

Tap History, then Clear browsing data.

At the top, choose a time range. To delete everything, select All time.

Check the boxes next to ""Cookies and site data"" and ""Cached images and files.""

Tap Clear data.

Clearing the cache from your apps can improve performance and give you more room for photos, videos, and new apps.

Open the Settings app, then tap Storage.

Tap Apps to see a list of your installed apps.

Find the application you want to clear the cache of and tap it. Tap Clear Cache to delete the app’s cache.

Android also allows you to free up space by deleting infrequently used apps and files. To access the Free Up feature, follow the steps below:

Tap Settings, then Storage.

Tap Free up space.

Your phone will recommend junk files, duplicates, memes, screenshots, blurry photos, and more for removal. Choose a category and tap Select files.

Choose each file you want to remove. At the bottom, select Move (number) files to Trash.

Update your operating system

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there's been an increased focus on mental health, especially among young people. 1 out of every 6 children age 6 to 17 experience a mental health disorder every year, and now a new investment company wants to use technology to make them easier to treat. Telosity by Vinaj Ventures is a fund set up back in 2019 specifically to invest in companies that provide tech-based solutions to improve mental well-being among young people, a demographic used to doing pretty much everything on their phones or computers. The founder and CEO, Anish Srivastava, says he was inspired to start the fund when he saw how few mental health resources were available, especially for kids and teens. ""Accessibility is very difficult,"" according to Srivastava, ""and what tech does is it helps democratize access to care.""

And if Telosity is successful, in the near future, kids and teens might be meeting their mental health counselors in cyberspace, which the company wants to use as a jumping off point to meet young people in the space where they're most comfortable. ""We can use that as a place for resources,"", says Srivastava, ""whether its educational types of capabilities, self learning mental health, being able to provide tele-therapy solutions, et cetera.""

And it's not just scheduling apps and telemedicine; new advancements in virtual reality could make it much easier for doctors to examine - and also treat patients - in an online setting. Telosity has been seeing a growing market interest in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), and much of it focuses on mental health assessment tools for providers. All that could make it even easier for kids and teens to access mental health resources, since they don't even have to leave their homes in many cases.

It's also good news for businesses. Telosity released a report last month showing youth mental health solutions will be a $26,000,000,000 market by 2027, and the company calls that an unprecedented opportunity for businesses to beef up their bottom line, while also providing help to millions of the most vulnerable Americans. Srivasta says that could be a major selling point for investors in the mental health space. ""There's an opportunity to do good while investing and building sustainable businesses, and I think that's the driver for tech.""

The key to retrieving text messages

Your best bet for retrieving deleted messages is accessing an older backup of your phone. You can do that through iCloud for your iPhone.

There's a big caveat you need to keep in mind: Restoring your phone to a previous backup means you lose new data after that backup.

Now, it's worth saying that these steps don't always work. If you strike out, you can try contacting your phone carrier. It may be able to restore deleted messages for you.

Have an iPhone? Turn on iCloud and iCloud Backup

On an iPhone, you have access to 5 GB of free storage. You will likely need to upgrade to an iCloud+ plan to store multiple backups and all your photos and videos. See pricing and tiers here .

To retrieve deleted texts on an iPhone, you must turn on iCloud Drive and iCloud Backup. Here’s how to enable Drive.

Turn on iCloud Drive by going to Settings.

Then, select your Apple ID.

After that, tap iCloud.

Lastly, turn on iCloud Drive.

After that, you need to turn on iCloud Backup. Do this by opening Settings > Selecting your Apple ID > tapping iCloud and selecting iCloud Backup.

NOTE: You will lose all new data after that backup. Make sure those deleted texts are worth it. Here’s how to access them.

How to get back deleted texts on iPhone

Remember, when you access an old backup, you reset your iPhone to old settings. This could lead to a few issues. If you’re willing to risk it, follow these steps to see if you have a backup available:

Go to Settings.

Select your Apple ID.

Tap iCloud > Manage Storage > Backups.

Next, follow these steps to use that backup to restore your phone:

Head to Settings > General > Reset.

Select Erase All Content and Settings.

Tap Restore from iCloud Backup.

Sign in with your Apple ID and tap Choose backup.

Your phone will revert to its former version. Now you can start looking through old texts.

This method won’t work if you’ve never backed up your iPhone on iCloud.

The researchers eventually aim to be able to dispense with biosensors.

""In the future, what we hope to do is connect a wireless chip integrated with this ink, so that we can communicate, or we can send signal back and forth between our body to an external device,"" said project leader Steve Park, a materials science and engineering professor.

If your TV is ""smart,"" I have bad news. It’s probably keeping an eye on everything you do and sending that info back to advertisers.

You can stop that, at least to some extent. Tap or click for settings to change on your television to stop this privacy invasion.

The same is true for your streaming devices and services. Tap or click to limit tracking through Netflix, Amazon, Roku, Hulu and more.

With your privacy bases covered, consider your health. Here are a few tips to minimize eye strain, neck strain and eye fatigue.

1. Lighting matters

""You're going to ruin your eyes!"" We all heard that as kids sitting in front of the TV, right? Watching TV probably won't cause lasting vision damage, but it might strain your eyes.

A mellow, dimly-lit room is the best way to watch TV. Open windows, glaring track lights, and other distracting illumination sources make your eyes work overtime.

You don’t need a bunch of fancy smart lighting or gadgets, either. Draw the blinds, turn off the house lights, and stick to incandescent over LEDs if you prefer not to go full-on black-out mode.

Lamps and other lights can cause annoying reflections and glare. Choose ambient light sources muffled by diffusive domes or lampshades.

Get your money’s worth: 5 things you didn’t know your smart TV could do

2. Smart formula to know if you’re too close

When it comes to eye health, you should sit far enough from the TV so your eyes won't be exposed to excessive glare.

The secret formula: Measure the width of your TV and multiply that number by five. This distance is the ballpark you should shoot for in your home theater, living room, or any other spot you have a TV. Now, it’s harder to stick to this formula with larger TVs.

The size of the room, the shape and number of seats you have to configure, and other factors like window placement also come into play. Some give or take is fine. Aim for at least about 10 feet away if you can.

3. Check your screen height

A TV installed too high or low can cause eye and neck strain. The most comfortable viewing experience is with the TV around eye level when you’re sitting. So, how do you set it up? Use a laser pointer or a long measuring tape to find your direct line of sight from the best seat in the house.

Have a friend or family member lightly mark the spot on the wall with a pencil. If you’re working alone, do your best to remember where the marker hit during the experiment. The center of your TV screen should sit about where you marked.

3 ways to find out if your smart TV was hacked (and how to protect it)

4. Turn down the brightness

Bright, concentrated blue light is harsh on your eyes. That’s why staring at your phone in a dark room can feel so jarring.

Is your TV backlit? An OLED? What HDR capabilities does it bring to the table? All this impacts what brightness is best. Your eyes will also give you lots of clues. Do you find yourself squinting when the room is dark? The TV is probably too bright.

Check your TV's user manual or click the settings menu to find the brightness. Don't just rely on one of the pre-sets. Tune up and down and see what's best for your space.

Take some time to play with color temperature, HDR settings, and image saturation, too.

Decades after they starved, beat and tortured the boy – caging him in a slatted wooden box the size of a coffin – an underage World War II veteran refused to speak about his former enemies with hatred. His story holds lessons about reconciliation for a nation battered by today’s culture wars.

Joseph Johnson was only 14 when he enlisted in the U.S. Army, a year before Pearl Harbor. He’d fled a difficult home life in Memphis, fibbed about his age to a recruiter, and managed to get lost in the shuffle. He was sent to Manila with the 31st Infantry Division, having no clue of the impending horror.

On Dec. 7, 1941, 10 hours after attacking Hawaii, Japan hit the Philippines. The largely under prepared U.S. and Filipino troops were plunged into battle. The boy fought bravely, loading machine guns and ferrying messages between headquarters and front lines. Once, to escape a sniper’s attack, he leaped into an empty foxhole, only to land on an enemy soldier crouching in the dirt. The boy fought for his life, subduing his opponent with his bare hands.

Joe had met an orphaned teenage girl back at a brothel in Manila, and they became unlikely friends who helped each other endure. When she’d become pregnant from her unfortunate job, Joe helped her seek sanctuary in a church. He paid the nuns for the girl’s room and board.

LAST REMAINING WORLD WAR II MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT TO LIE IN HONOR AT US CAPITOL

The memory of her friendship helped sustain the boy in the fight on Corregidor, where Joe and his fellow soldiers made their last stand. The allied troops were outgunned and outmanned, plagued with tropical diseases, and cut off from resupply. As their foodstuffs slowly diminished, they ate monkeys found in the jungle.

Finally, in May 1942, Gen. Jonathan Wainwright formally surrendered all allied troops in the Philippines. Joe laid down his arms and became a prisoner of war. He was 16.

At the brutal Nichols Field detail, Joe and fellow POWs were forced to extend an airstrip. It was backbreaking work with a pick and shovel in the broiling sun.

Joe suffered from a raft of tropical diseases, including pellagra, dry beriberi, scurvy and malaria. After being savagely beaten for a small rule infraction, Joe knew he wouldn’t survive Nichols Field. Feigning insanity, he sliced his arms with a sharpened spoon and smeared blood on his face, hoping the guards would send him to Bilibid Prison, where a few American doctors still practiced.

That’s when he spent a week locked in a cage. Naked, bloodied, prodded through the slats by his captors, the boy was given no food or drink. Rainwater kept him alive. Finally, he was tossed on the back of a truck and driven to Bilibid, where he slowly regained his health. His audacious plan had worked.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, AUGUST 2, 1943, JFK SAVES PT-109 CREW AFTER COLLISION WITH JAPANESE DESTROYER

But his horrors weren’t over. In October 1944, Joe and 1,600 POWs were loaded onto a ship to work in Japan’s mines. By the time they reached port six weeks later, only 450 POWs were still alive. Suffering malnutrition and a grisly leg injury, Joe was held at the Fukuoka POW camp until Japan’s surrender in August 1945. At last, he came home to freedom. Joe was 19 years old and had grown to 6 feet, 4 inches. He weighed only 109 pounds.

Post-war, Joe struggled with severe PTSD. Counseling, family and faith helped. He learned the wisdom of forgiveness, as recorded in his journal: ""Life is too short to hold on to hurt. Whether you’re hurt from being abused as a POW or from your daddy leaving when you were young, you got to set that hurt down. You’ll only hurt yourself when you harbor hate.""

In his senior years, Joe became active in veteran causes, using his scars to help people heal. He became a rebuilder of lives, a restorer of spirits. Whenever he spoke about the past, he never used the derogatory word for his former captors, always speaking about them with respect.

For America today, embroiled in culture wars and divided by hostilities, a nod to Joe Johnson may well be part of the solution to rebuilding the country. Each person holds an individual responsibility to promote peace. More understanding is the answer, more finding common ground, more forgiveness.

January 24, 2006, our family went from watching the nightly news to being the news story, that day, my niece Jennifer Kesse was abducted in Orlando, Fla. and our lives changed forever.

On the morning of Jan. 24 Jenn failed to report to her job as a finance manager at a well-known timeshare company. She was 24 years old. She was last heard from at around 10 p.m. the night before when she spoke by phone with her family and boyfriend from inside her condominium.

In the weeks following Jenn’s abduction, during the day, our family and friends were busy doing everything we could to raise awareness and handing out missing person flyers at major road intersections, posting them in businesses, and going door to door in the neighborhoods near Jenn’s condo. We were encouraged daily by people who came to help a family in need, a family they didn’t know.

Most nights, I was exhausted physically and emotionally, lying in bed trying to fall asleep, but my mind would not turn off. Thoughts bounced from trying to make sense of what happened to Jennifer to my marriage, business, and kids. Those nights were filled with tears, as my emotions were on hyperdrive, trying to process everything that was happening.

JENNIFER KESSE DISAPPEARANCE: POLICE PHOTOS SUGGEST VIOLENT STRUGGLE

Those restless nights felt more like a wrestling match with my past while being confronted with the brutal facts of my present reality. Facing reality is painful, but I would learn that it is also beneficial, restorative, and transformative if embraced.

I began crying out to God, which in itself is puzzling since I had walked away from church when I was 14 years old. It has been said that pain is God’s megaphone, and it turns out to be true. He now had my undivided attention. I was approaching my 50th birthday in May 2006 and facing the most desperate and challenging crisis in my life with nowhere to go and no one to turn to but God.

I bared my heart and soul to Him, just like I would with my best friends. For the first time in my life, I acknowledged how out of control my life was while feeling powerless to fix the mess I had created. I was forced to confront the truth about my life in a different way, in a way I would never have chosen.

Every night I prayed desperately for Jennifer to be brought home safely, to have the life she deserved. In those moments, I asked God to take my life so that Jenn could have hers back.

I had hit rock bottom. One night, I remember experiencing a sense of peace during my conversations with God that defied my current circumstances. It felt odd, bizarre. How could this be? How do I have peace when everything in and around me is in turmoil? What did this all mean?

ROBERT JEFFRESS: DON’T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF PRAYER, NO MATTER WHAT OTHERS SAY

Pain is indeed a megaphone. I opened my heart to hear what God was saying and embraced a new life He offered. By His grace, I was inspired to write a book, ""Aftermath of Jennifer Kesse’s Abduction: An Uncle’s Inspiring Journey and Other Stories of Hope.""

In the book, I share my 16-year journey of life transformation, from selfish to selfless, authentically and vulnerably, and introduce readers to inspirational stories of people who overcame unimaginable obstacles.

Inspired hope is not wishful thinking but a confident expectation only found in one person through an intimate relationship that lasts our lifetime. This hope is anchored to a person and a promise - the person of Jesus and the promise - that if you believe in Jesus, you will have life; an authentic and meaningful life resulting from being rescued, redeemed, and restored to a right relationship with God that will positively impact all the relationships in your life.

I need that confident hope and thankfully God gave the strength and patience to persevere over the past 16 plus years. I knew I wasn’t the person I wanted to be, nor was I the husband and father my family deserved.

The road I traveled included some rocky paths, some slippery slopes, and some uncomfortable terrain that was my life and relationships at that time. As I pursued my new life and preferred future, some of the people in my life may not be happy, it made them uncomfortable. Some believed it was my latest fad. Over time it became obvious it was not.

Thankfully, my wife and family never gave up on me, and most people in my life encouraged and cheer me on to finish strong.

If you would like to change the narrative direction of your life, I found the best place to start is with ourselves. Having focused on becoming the person I wished other people were, I was transformed into a better version of myself, and honestly, I cringe thinking about my old self. Know that I will be cheering you on so that you finish strong!

I do have one request -- that you keep my sister Joyce, my brother-in-law, Drew, and my nephew Logan and his family in your prayers because as of the date of this writing, Jennifer is still missing, vanished without a trace.

One of my objectives for writing this book is that the person or people who were involved in Jennifer’s abduction would know that no matter what they have done, the final chapter of their life stories has not been written. They can come forward with information that will either bring Jenn home or bring closure to our family. Facing the truth does, in fact, set you free, and a new life is waiting to begin.

The head of the Anglican Communion attempted to reinforce the church's stance against homosexual marriage this week, but the move was squashed by outcry from various bishops.

The controversy came to a head during the ongoing 2022 Lambeth Conference — a rare meeting of Anglican Communion bishops from around the world.

The Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches (GSFA) — self-described as ""a worldwide fellowship of orthodox Anglican Provinces and Dioceses within the Anglican Communion"" — came to the conference with the gay marriage ban firmly on their agenda.

""We often feel that our voices are not listened to, or respected,"" South Sudanese Primate Rev. Justin Badi told The Church Times. ""Today, in Canterbury, we may be ‘gathered together’, but we most certainly cannot ‘walk together’ until Provinces which have gone against scripture — and the will of the consensus of the bishops — repent and return to orthodoxy.""

QUEEN ELIZABETH SNUBS PRINCE HARRY, PRAISES PRINCES CHARLES, WILLIAM FOR HONORING PRINCE PHILLIP'S CLIMATE WORK

He continued, ""The Communion is not in a healthy condition at present, and only major surgery will put that right.""

They were bolstered in private, if not publicly, by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. The archbishop, by the nature of his office, is the most senior cleric in the Anglican Communion but holds limited powers of governance on his own.

POPE FRANCIS WARNS GERMAN BISHOPS: CHANGING TEACHINGS IS 'NOT LAWFUL,' CAUSES CHURCHES TO 'ROT AND DIE'

Welby met with the GSFA in private on July 29 and offered to write a letter backing the traditional view of marriage, according to Anglican Church journalist George Conger. A call was scheduled for the conference — a sort of vote amongst the bishops to endorse or abandon proposed belief statements.

The next day — after word got out about the push for a formal rejection of homosexual marriage — the conference was threatened with chaos.

Many bishops reportedly stayed seated and did not receive the Eucharist during the mass. Protests against recording votes on church calls arose, and eventually, the conference ceased keeping track of individual bishops' decisions.

The call to reinforce Lambeth 1.10 was eventually dropped.

However, there was no demonstration against the archbishop nor the conference, and proceedings continued.

Despite the fervor, Welby made good on his promised letter, released to the faithful on Tuesday.

""I wanted to write this letter to you now so that I can clarify two matters for all of us. Given the deep differences that exist within the Communion over same-sex marriage and human sexuality, I thought it important to set down what is the case,"" Welby wrote in his letter.

REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM AND THE BILLY GRAHAM EVANGELISTIC ASSOCIATION SHOW CHRISTIANS' STRUGGLES IN UKRAINE AMID WAR

He continued, ""I write therefore to affirm that the validity of the resolution passed at the Lambeth Conference 1998, 1:10 is not in doubt and that whole resolution is still in existence. Indeed the Call on Human Dignity made clear this is the case, as the resolution is quoted from three times in the paragraph 2.3 of the Call on Human Dignity.""

The archbishop went on to point out that the 1998 statues cited did not make mention of sanctions or exclusions based on obedience. Welby said that the ""Pain, anxiety, and contention"" caused by Lambeth 1.10 was ""very clear.""

He concluded, ""To be reconciled to one another across such divides is not something we can achieve by ourselves. That is why, as we continue to reflect on 1 Peter, I pray that we turn our gaze towards Christ who alone has the power to reconcile us to God and to one another.""

Anglicanism has been fracturing for decades over gay relationships, women's ordination and other issues. Those rifts blew wide open in 2003 when the New York-based Episcopal Church consecrated the first openly gay bishop, Gene Robinson, in New Hampshire.

The year prior, the top U.S. Episcopal legislative body, or General Convention, voted to authorize gay marriages in their churches.

Jury deliberations in the New Hampshire trial of a truck driver charged with killing seven motorcyclists began Tuesday after closing statements raised questions about who was more ""all over the place"": the trucker accused of swerving back and forth across the road or the eyewitnesses accused of contradicting each other.

Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, 26, of West Springfield, Massachusetts, faces negligent homicide, manslaughter and reckless conduct charges in connection with the June 21, 2019, crash that killed seven members of a Marine motorcycle club.

MASSACHUSETTS TRUCK DRIVER WHOSE CRASH KILLED 7 MOTORCYCLISTS APPEARS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TRIAL

Prosecutors have argued that Zhukovskyy, who had taken heroin, fentanyl and cocaine that day, repeatedly swerved back and forth before the head-on crash and told police he caused it. But a judge dismissed eight charges related to whether he was impaired, and his attorneys blame the lead biker, Albert ""Woody"" Mazza, who was among those killed.

""He was drunk, he was not looking where he was going, he lost control of his motorcycle and slid in front of Vlad Zhukovskyy’s truck. Al Mazza caused this accident. Vlad Zhukovskyy is not guilty,"" defense attorney Jay Duguay said in closing statements.

""There is no doubt that this accident was a tragedy,"" Duguay said. ""But we are not here to decide whether or not this was a tragedy.""

Duguay accused prosecutors of ignoring that their own accident reconstruction unit contradicted their theory that Zhukovskyy crossed into the oncoming lane. An expert hired by the defense, meanwhile, testified that the crash happened on the center line of the road and would have occurred even if the truck was in the middle of its lane because Mazza’s motorcycle was heading in that direction.

""From the beginning of this investigation, the state had made up their mind about what had happened, evidence be damned,"" said Duguay, who also highlighted inconsistencies between witness accounts or when witnesses contradicted themselves.

TRUCK DRIVER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE CRASH THAT KILLED 7 BIKERS WAS ON DRUGS, REPORT SAYS

""Those witnesses were all over the place about what they recalled and what they claimed to have seen,"" he said.

In particular, Duguay suggested that members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club ""shaded"" their accounts to protect Mazza and the club. Prosecutor Scott Chase acknowledged some inconsistencies but asked jurors to remember the circumstances.

""People were covering the dead, trying to save the barely living, comforting the dying. This wasn’t story time,"" he said. ""They were up here talking about some of the most unimaginable chaos, trauma, death and carnage that we can even imagine three years later. They were talking about hell broke open.""

Witnesses were consistent, he argued, in describing the truck as weaving back and forth before the crash. That behavior continued ""until he killed people,"" Chase said.

""That’s what stopped him. It’s not that he made some responsible decision to start paying attention or do the right thing,"" he said. ""The only thing that stopped him was an embankment after he tore through a group of motorcycles.""

Chase called the attempt to blame Mazza a ""fanciful story"" and ""frivolous distraction,"" while reminding jurors that Zhukovskyy, who didn’t testify at trial, told investigators, ""Obviously, I caused the crash.""

""He was crystal clear from the very beginning that he caused this crash,"" Chase said. ""That is what he said because that is what happened.""

The motorcyclists who died were from New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island and ranged in age from 42 to 62. They were part of a larger group that had just left a motel along U.S. Route 2 in Randolph.

On the day of the shooting, Trotter complained that Avery's lawn mower was too loud and made a gesture with his hand that he would shoot Avery, according to court documents. Avery said he called the police and was told nothing could be done, then Trotter waved an actual gun around and said nothing would happen to him.

Hours later, Trotter and a woman returned to the home with food from a restaurant. The woman told police she was inside the house when she heard Trotter ask Avery something like, ""Do you have something to say?""

Then she heard several shots.

Avery told police that Trotter reached for a gun before Avery started firing his weapon, according to records.

Footage from security cameras at Trotter's home show him saying something to Avery then starting to enter the house when Avery fired at Trotter several times, according to the statement.

The video clearly shows Trotter did not reach for his weapon at any time, according to the probable cause statement. It also said first responding officers removed a weapon from Trotter’s waistband before emergency responders began treating him.

Kellogg's cereal company is the largest cereal distributor in the United States with its origins dating back to the late 19th century.

Corn flakes were Kellogg's company's first product that made them the king of cereal and a huge player in the American breakfast market. Will and John Kellogg created the product together in order to create a digestible yet affordable breakfast meal for middle Americans. During this period, many Americans had digestible issues due to the limited number of dietary options for middle-class Americans.

Together the Kellogg brothers promoted their new product as a ""nutritious and healthful"" breakfast option, but a disagreement over whether a small detail led to them splitting apart and the creation of the Kellogg cereal company.

Why was Corn Flakes invented?

John Kellogg, and his brother, Will, invented corn flakes for patients at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in 1894. The patients enjoyed the cereal, and two years later, a patent for the recipe was granted in 1896. The two brothers eventually went their separate ways after disagreeing over whether to add sugar to the cereal.

By the 20th century, Kellogg's Cereal Company cereal was marketed for its daily health benefits and as an easily digestible meal. They also emphasize the sweet flavor of the flakes and their ""dainty crispness."" During this time, indigestion was a big concern for Americans with sensitive stomachs, especially because morning dining options were limited.

Moreover, the cereal was also invented to align with the dietary restrictions of the Seventh Day Adventist church attended by the Kellogg family.

Are corn flakes good for you?

Corn flakes were created as a healthy and easily digestible cereal that would appeal to a broad demographic of Americans. However, corn flakes like any other cereal are low in fiber even when eaten with low-fat milk, so they are not the healthiest option for a balanced breakfast. If you do eat cornflakes the healthiest option would be to combine them with a piece of fruit or snack.

What is in corn flakes?

Kellogg's is suitable for vegans due to the ingredients that make up the golden flakes which are sugar, salt, barley malt extract, and vitamin E. Approximately 90% of the context is made out of corn.

A major point of disagreement between the Kellogg brothers was over the inclusion of sugar in the product because John did not want any traces of sugar in corn flakes while his brother Will believed it would attract more customers."

An 80-year-old Washington state woman was permanently banned from her local YMCA pool after demanding that a transgender employee leave the women’s locker room, she told local media.

""I saw a man in a woman’s bathing suit watching maybe four or five little girls pulling down their suits in order to use the toilet,"" Port Townsend resident Julie Jaman recalled of the July incident to Seattle radio show host Dori Monson on Friday. ""I asked if he had a penis and he said it was none of my business. I told that man to ‘get out right now.’""

The incident occurred on July 26 at the Mountain View pool, which is a City of Port Townsend facility operated by the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, according to local news outlet Port Townsend Free Press.

Jaman said that she was alerted to the trans employee being in the women’s locker room while she was showering and ""heard a man’s voice.""

She told Monson that she alerted a pool staffer to the incident and was stunned when the staff member told her she was ""being discriminatory,"" and ""was banned from the pool forever."" The staffer also allegedly said the police would be called, according to Jaman’s radio interview.

""She didn’t ask me what the problem was, if I was okay, nothing about me,"" Jaman told Monson. ""It’s as if she was just waiting to pounce on me. It was just stunning.""

The Port Townsend Police Department told Fox News Digital that no official police report was filed, but the department provided an incident report on the matter.

The incident report details that Jaman ""had an emotional response to a strange male being in the bathroom"" near young girls, and is hoping to not be ""trespassed"" from the pool, according to a phone call an officer had with Jaman. The report also noted a phone call from the YMCA detailing that Jaman was reportedly in the facility’s locker room ""screaming"" at an employee and ""refusing to leave.""

Erin Hawkins, the marketing & communications manager for the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, told Fox News Digital that the permanent pool ban followed a build-up of incidents where Jaman violated the facility’s code of conduct. She said the permanent suspension was not solely due to the singular incident in the women's locker room last month.

""Julie Jaman was permanently suspended from the Mountain View Pool due to her repeatedly violating our Code of Conduct, specifically, using disrespectful words or gestures toward YMCA staff or others; abusive, harassing and/or obscene language or gestures toward YMCA staff or others,"" Hawkins said in comment to Fox News Digital on Monday.

Jaman told Monson that she was suspended from the facility despite having ""a great relationship with swimmers in the pool.""

Jaman told local media that she had been a member of the pool facility for 35 years and has lived in Port Townsend for about 40 years. She has voted for Democrats during her life, she told the local outlet, and considers herself an ""XX woman,"" referring to her chromosomes.

She added to the Port Townsend Free Press that she recoiled at being naked and showering in a room with a person born male. She added that the ""momma bear in me"" came out when she saw the individual near the young girls in the bathroom.

Jaman added that she also spoke with the CEO of the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, Wendy Bart, and said that she told Bart there should be warnings that the bathrooms were also used by trans individuals.

​​""I told her there were no signs posted to give women warning,"" Jaman told Monson. ""She said there were Pride posters posted all over and she assumed that was adequate to inform women what to expect."" Bart also said, ""‘we take pride and everyone is welcome,’"" according to Jaman’s description of the conversation.

""That’s fine with me, except that they do not provide alternatives for women who choose not to be undressing in front of men,"" Jaman continued in the radio interview. ""Our pool is a very old pool. We just have two shower rooms, dressing rooms, one for men, one for women.""

He said, ""It's crazy. There are vets [out there] today that don't know about us"" — and they need to, he said, so that they can get the help and support they deserve.

He said that going to the group's website, TheFund.org, ""is the easiest way to learn about us,"" he said. Anyone can donate as well to help America's vets.

Getting more exercise could be linked to a longer life.

A new 12-page research article published in the American Heart Association’s Circulation Journal found that people who got extra exercise had a lower mortality rate compared to those who did not.

The study, which was conducted by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, was published on Monday, July 25.

Over a 30-year period from 1988 to 2018, a total of 116,221 adults were monitored and submitted exercise reports that detailed their ""leisure-time physical activity.""

HOW TO EXERCISE DURING A WORK TRIP AND STAY FIT WHILE TRAVELING

Mortality reduction was observed in study participants who got 150 to 300 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week and 300 to 600 minutes of moderate physical activity.

Vigorous exercisers who participated in activities like jogging, running, climbing stairs, swimming, bicycling, aerobics, playing sports and working outdoors for 150 to 299 minutes, had a lower mortality rate between 21% and 23% for all causes of death.

This exercise group also had lower cardiovascular deaths between 27% and 33% and lower non-cardiovascular deaths by 19%. People who exercised vigorously for more than 300 minutes per week ""did not have further lower mortality,"" according to the study.

Moderate exercisers, on the other hand, who participated in activities like walking, weightlifting performing lower-intensity workouts and calisthenics for 150 to 299 minutes, had a lower mortality rate between 20% and 21% for all causes of death.

In terms of cardiovascular deaths, moderate exercisers had a 22% to 25% lower chance, and for non-cardiovascular deaths, moderate exercisers had a 19% to 20% lower chance.

People who exercised moderately for 300 to 599 minutes per week had ""3% to 13% further lower mortality,"" according to the study.

Researchers behind the study documented 47,596 deaths during its observation.

""The nearly maximum association with lower mortality was achieved by performing ≈150 to 300 min/wk of long-term leisure-time [vigorous physical activity], 300 to 600 min/wk of long-term leisure-time [moderate physical activity], or an equivalent combination of both,"" the team wrote in the study’s conclusion.

However, the study’s participants were pulled from surveys collected by the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which may have skewed results.

Most of the study participants were in their 60s, had a normal BMI, rarely ate more than 2,000 calories per day, drank alcohol occasionally and hardly smoked.

There was a lack of racial diversity as well with more than 90% of study participants being White.

CAREER CHALLENGE: SHOULD YOU SOCIALIZE WITH YOUR BOSS OUTSIDE OF THE WORKPLACE?

While you’re traveling, fitness experts say you don’t need fancy gyms, pricey equipment or an abundance of free time to incorporate fitness into your business travel schedule. To make sure get some exercise in while you're away, try these smart tips.

1. Use the hotel's amenities if you can

Aim for a hotel with a gym, a pool and one that’s in a pedestrian-friendly location.

You can swim laps in the pool, use cardio equipment and do weight-training in the fitness center and walk around the area where your hotel is located.

As a fitness professional who travels to certify trainers around the country, Cary Williams, CEO of Boxing & Barbells in Santa Monica, California, said she does her best to book a hotel with a gym when she’s traveling.

However, if you can’t find a hotel that offers all these amenities — don’t worry.

THESE ARE THE BEST FOODS FOR YOUR HEART, EXPERTS SAY

""If there is not a gym or the gym is closed, there are plenty of exercises you can do in your room without equipment,"" Williams said.

Also, to get your steps in, skip the elevator and use the stairs, she advised.

2. Do an in-room workout

The best plan, said Williams, is to set your alarm an hour earlier while out of town so that you have at least a good 30-45 minutes to get in a workout.

She recommends an interval type of workout with about six exercises: three body weight exercises and three cardio-types of exercises.

""Find a timer app on your phone and set it for 45 seconds of work time and 15 second rest time between exercises,"" she said.

Williams curated an example of a room workout. She said each of the following exercises should take six minutes (aim for five rounds): squats; knee ups (high knees in place); push-ups; jumping rope (bring you own); lunges; and sit-ups.

You can add some weights to your workout if you have your own — or you can use dumbbells from the hotel’s gym.

3. Explore your surroundings

Chelsea Cohen, co-founder of SoStocked, in Austin, Texas, said fitness is a vital part of her daily routine. When she is traveling for work, her goal is to ensure the same.

""Exploring keeps me fit,"" said Cohen. ""Each business trip comes with a new opportunity to explore and indulge in exciting activities.""

She added, ""Whenever I’m in a new city, I make sure that I walk around a bit whether it’s for shopping or finding a good restaurant.""

Cohen said she prioritizes taking a walking path to her work meetings.

HOW TO KNOW IF YOUR SUNSCREEN IS EXPIRED

""This helps keep my body in motion,"" she said. ""The best thing is that walking keeps my mind off the usual workouts and gives me the much-needed exercise without needing to carve extra time for it.""

Outside work meetings, pack a pair of sneakers and walk the area to learn about the new city and explore.

4. Embrace technology

As CEO of Brooklyn, NY-based MediaPeanut, Victoria Mendoza said she frequently travels for business; technology has helped keep her on track in terms of her fitness and health.

""I have recently learned to incorporate technology into my own fitness regimen,"" she said.

She uses several apps to help her with calorie counting, measuring calories burned during exercise and daily activities — and also measuring her daily steps and monitoring her exercise activities.

""Some of these popular apps are Fooducate, Strides, MyFitnessPal and Fitbit aside from the health trackers in my phone,"" she added.

""Setting aside an hour for a virtual fitness trainer session allows me to not stray from my fitness goals and correctly do my workouts, even with limited machines.""

Also, Mendoza said she’s hired virtual fitness trainers who monitor her fitness activities and plan her workouts at least twice or three times a week, even while she travels for work.

""Setting aside an hour for a virtual fitness trainer session allows me to not stray from my fitness goals and correctly do my workouts, even with limited machines."" She said the virtual trainers come up with ""exercise plans depending on the location and time and space that I have at my disposal.""

5. Cycle your way to health

Jarelle Parker, a Silicon Valley personal trainer in Menlo Park, California, suggested booking a bike tour around a new city.

""This is a great way to meet people and to be adventurous by exploring a new environment,"" she said. ""It's also a great way to incorporate fitness into your travel.""

She mentioned that Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, New York and San Diego ""have amazing bike tours for fitness travelers.""

If indoor cycling is more the preference (along with others to help motivate you), Parker noted that the ClassPass app can help.

Ella Halikas has gone viral for recreating some of Julia Fox’s most daring looks – but for the SI Swimsuit model, it was a no-brainer.

""I remember she was wearing the low-rise look, and I was like, ‘Ooh, the low-rise is coming back,’"" the 24-year-old chuckled to Fox News Digital. ""And I remember people who were a lot curvier were scared of that. I would come across videos on TikTok of girls saying, ‘There’s no way I’m participating in this trend. I don’t have the right body.’ My first thought was, ‘Why not?’ Obviously, we have different body types, but I also love to showcase my body. And I thought if I could wear this, someone else might feel they can too. We can feel just as confident and beautiful together. I wanted to start that conversation.""

The curve model took to Instagram where she posted side-by-side photos of herself and Fox, 32, wearing similar looks. Some pieces Halikas wore included black and white Calvin Klein underwear while grocery shopping, as well as a cropped white tank top and a mini skirt paired with black patent gloves and boots – two recognizable styles from the fellow model.

Halikas said she received an overwhelming amount of support after the photos went viral.

KELLY HUGHES, THE FIRST SI SWIM MODEL TO BARE HER C-SECTION SCAR, REACTS TO NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA

""I wanted to show people you can rock whatever you want, you can feel just as confident and beautiful,"" the California native shared. ""I wanted other girls to be seen. I wanted others to feel good in their skin and be encouraged to try wearing something they feel they could never wear. I’ve gotten such a great reaction from people, and they’re loving it. I mean, it takes time, effort and money to organize all these shoots that are unpaid. But it’s a great feeling to know it’s encouraging others to showcase their bodies.""

According to Halikas, she actually went to a grocery store in Beverly Hills to mimic Fox’s supermarket look.

""The secret to making Julia Fox’s look – or any look for that matter – your own is confidence,"" she explained. ""It’s not so much about body type. It’s about how you carry yourself. It’s not about how you look physically. It’s about how you feel mentally. You have to walk with your chest up high and feel good. When you see the photos, you have to feel the confidence, the energy. That’s what makes people go, ‘She looks good.’ If I had walked to that store all covered up and my chin down looking nervous, people would say, ‘That’s not flattering, put some clothes on. What are you doing?’ You have to own your body and you have to own your look. If you can have that mental shift and find that confidence, then you can pull off anything.""

Halikas said the ""Uncut Gems"" star has not reached out to her personally after the photos went viral, but she has seen them.

""She would look at my Stories [on Instagram],"" Halikas explained. ""She liked both of my posts. She’s just never commented or personally reach out… But this isn’t really about mimicking a celebrity or about Julia Fox personally. It’s more about recreating a style and showing it on a different body type. I would love to start doing different celebrities and other thinner women like Bella Hadid. ""

The star first made a splash in 2021 when she was photographed by veteran photographer Yu Tsai in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for SI Swimsuit. Halikas, who has been inspired by Ashley Graham and Hunter McGrady, said it has always been a dream of hers to appear in the magazine.

""The shoot just felt like a dream,"" she recalled. ""I even connected with Ashley Graham. She sent me a voice message the morning of my shoot. I remember she said, ‘I’m so proud of you, you should be proud of yourself. You’ve come so far.’ I just started crying. I stayed up late the night before my shoot watching videos of her modeling on YouTube to get some inspiration. So I couldn’t believe my role model was cheering me on. I felt empowered. What I love about this brand is that the girls are so uplifting and encouraging. You couldn’t find a more supportive sisterhood.""

""I remember when the magazine finally came out, I was searching all around San Francisco where I was for a shoot, going to every Walgreens, CVS, library, Barnes & Noble,"" Halikas continued. ""I couldn’t find it anywhere. After hours of searching, I had to go to the airport and get on a flight to Miami. I went to a newsstand there and saw it on the wall. I immediately grabbed it. I got a full page in the issue… I was so proud that I made it that far.""

Today, Halikas hopes that her body will serve as an inspiration to other women who ""deserve to be seen"" in the fashion industry.

""It’s been super important for me to talk about the difference between body positivity and body neutrality,"" she explained. ""Body positivity is when you accept your body, not really wanting to change it. Body neutrality means you love your body, but you’re OK with change too. I’m more neutral. I love my body, and I’m very positive about it, but there are things that I believe can make me stronger. I’m always looking to be the best version of myself… I enjoy working out and for me, it’s way more than just trying to lose weight. I’m not even thinking about weight or needing to lose. I’m thinking, ‘How can I get more toned? How can I feel healthier? How can I help my anxiety? How can I improve my mental health?’""

The model shared that she relies on consistent Pilates and weight-lifting to challenge herself, all while improving her mental health. She is also an avid fan of soccer, hot yoga and the occasional jog.

""The advice I would give to anyone who is intimidated by the gym is that nobody in there is worried about you,"" she advised. ""They’re more into themselves. In life, we always think people are looking at us and judging, whether it’s when we’re wearing a new outfit or at the gym. Most people, especially nowadays, are just so concerned with themselves. If you’re intimidated, get a workout buddy or meet with a trainer. If the weight room looks scary because it’s just a bunch of guys, hop on a treadmill. You can also go to a room alone and do some cardio. I also go to a Pilates class, and I’m probably the biggest girl there… but in a way, it empowers me. I’m thinking, ‘Yeah, I’m twice your size, but look what I can do.’ Health and fitness look different in every single body. I’m all about feeling strong to be my best self.""

""More importantly, don’t compare yourself to others, especially when everyone is out right now wearing a bikini,"" she said. ""There’s so much power in just being you. You are unique. Don’t lose sight of that. It’s easier said than done, but it’s not fun comparing yourself to everyone else. Embrace who you are and what you’re capable of."""

Donna D’Errico isn’t going to let any trolls on social media stop her from rocking a bikini.

The ""Baywatch"" alum took to Instagram Tuesday and posted a video of her modeling a hot pink bikini that accentuated her beach-ready bod and sun-kissed tan. She wore her brunette tresses down and opted for a natural look.

The actress, who was standing in front of her bed, gave her nearly 900,000 followers a look from every angle.

I read this book called ‘The Four Agreements’ and realized how life-changing it is when you stop taking the mean things people say personally.

Back in April 2021, Brinkley told Fox News Digital she hoped her latest swimsuit snaps, which often go viral, will inspire other women to celebrate themselves — no matter their age.

""I post these pictures because I hear from women my age all the time that say, ‘Thank you for changing the way people think about the numbers,’"" Brinkley said at the time. ""Back in the day, numbers represented something. I remember people thinking that after 30, you should never wear your hair past your shoulders or your hemline needed to hover your knee caps.""

""I’ve always found those rules so limiting,"" she said. ""Everybody’s different, everybody’s unique. But it’s like telling a gymnast she can’t do flips past a certain age. It doesn’t make sense.

Kelly Hughes made history this summer when she became the first model to bare her cesarean-section scar for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition in the magazine's 58-year history.

The outlet partnered with Frida Mom to raise awareness of Pay With Change, an initiative aimed to ""positively shift the mainstream cultural narratives associated with women’s bodies – especially when becoming a mom.""

The proud model and mom wore a nude-hued skimpy string bikini for the 2022 issue which features Kim Kardashian, Maye Musk, Ciara and Yumi Nu as this year’s cover girls.

Hughes delivered her now 3-year-old son via cesarean. She joins Katrina Scott, 2021’s Rookie of the Year, who was photographed when she was six and a half months pregnant, as well as Hunter McGrady, who posed for the outlet six months postpartum.

After Hughes' photo went viral, the founder and designer of the jewelry brand HÜES partnered with ESTAS Beauty to start the #ScarLoveChallenge on social media to spread a feeling of empowerment and change the societal stigma around scars. The challenge encourages participants to reinterpret Hughes' photo showing off their scars. Every time a #ScarLoveChallenge photo is posted, ESTAS will donate $1 to World of Children, helping disadvantaged children around the globe.

Hughes spoke to Fox News Digital about the struggles she endured during labor, the insecurities she faced after giving birth, as well as how she now responds to negative comments on Instagram.

Fox News: How did you get involved with SI Swimsuit?

Kelly Hughes: One of my friends in New York, who is also a model, saw that they were looking for a girl with a C-section scar, and they were shooting in the Florida Keys, which is close to me as I’m in Miami. I reached out to my agency, they proposed me and that’s how I got the job. It’s so wonderful because my friend is also a mother. And without her, I wouldn’t have gotten this opportunity. So it’s beautiful to see one mother supporting another mother.

Fox News: Take us back to your shoot. What was that like?

Hughes: I had a million things running through my mind before I even started shooting. I had never shown my scar before. And I have been really open with how I struggled with insecurities around my scar. I originally didn’t want a C-section because the bounce back was going to be much harder being that I’m a model.

Society just puts so much pressure on you to ""bounce back."" I wasn’t a size two anymore. I wasn’t doing too much modeling in a bikini in the first place. So it was scary at first to show my biggest insecurity in a magazine like Sports Illustrated. I wasn’t sure how I was going to be received.

Fox News: How were you received on set?

Hughes: As soon as I arrived, the editor just made me feel so confident and beautiful. She turned my insecurity into the most beautiful thing in the world. She just made me feel so much better about my scar. I felt so much more confident about myself. I just looked at my scar in the mirror and I realized I shouldn’t have to feel so insecure about this anymore. And when it was time to shoot, everyone reacted the same way. They made me feel so empowered and inspired. I imagine how many beautiful women they’ve seen, and now I get to be part of that representation. The experience was a healing one for me. It just really helped me to overcome my insecurities.

Fox News: How important was it for you to show off your C-section scar despite your insecurities?

Hughes: To be honest, I had no idea how much this would impact people. But my photo went viral all over the world. This is something I probably wouldn’t have done before, but I also didn’t see myself in the same way I see myself now. And I think it’s beautiful that a magazine like Sports Illustrated is showing a woman with a C-section and saying, ""she’s beautiful."" Now, I realize how important that photo is to me because I had no idea how underrepresented this was.

Apparently, one in three women are having C-sections now – that’s a large number of women. But this doesn’t just resonate with women who have C-sections. This also resonates with women who have scars in general and are insecure about them. The fashion industry has evolved, and they’re finally starting to embrace different women. We don’t have to all look the same. So this photo represents so much more than a C-section scar… I feel a true responsibility to continue this conversation.

And for some reason, the moment I shot that picture, I just knew it was going to be chosen. It just shows pure joy. And I think that’s what we should feel when we look at our scars. It represents we overcame something difficult, and we’re here.

You know in the fashion industry, nobody wants to show cellulite. Nobody wants to show scars. But these things are normal, and they should be normalized. And when you see my photo, you just see pure joy. I was so insecure about my scar, but it also represents the most beautiful moment of my life because my son was born. So I should feel joy.

Fox News: Some critics have said, ""SI Swimsuit is a magazine of women in bikinis. Do we really need to see this?"" What would you tell those people?

Hughes: It’s interesting, I was shocked that about 99% of people that reached out to me have been supportive. Even the press I received after my photo went viral was supportive. Sure, sometimes people like to make their comments – it is Instagram – but I’ve gotten an overwhelming number of positive comments from both men and women. Of course, you still get comments like ""who cares?"" or ""she’s half-naked"" or ""we don’t want to see this"" – all those comments are generic. And the truth is, there will always be people out there who want to dim your light.

All I can say is I don’t understand how someone can make negative comments, especially on someone’s social media posts. There’s no need for it. You don’t gain anything from that. But the overwhelming amount of positive comments from people proves that something like this was needed. This is about representation. Think about those mothers out there with C-section scars wearing a bikini at the beach. Sometimes it peeks out.

SI SWIM MODEL VICTORIA VESCE RECALLS OVERCOMING ‘NIGHTMARE’ BRAIN TUMOR: ‘I HAD EVERY SYMPTOM IN THE BOOK’

I’ve received so many messages from women telling me they’ve felt so insecure going to the beach that they buy a bigger bikini or just choose to wear a one-piece to avoid the scrutiny. They go out of their way to not show the scar because they’re insecure about it. They’re worried about what people may say or think. Now, Sports Illustrated is having that conversation. It was so needed. You shouldn’t need to accommodate everyone else just so they can feel better. You’re so much more than any negative comment someone may have to say.

Now, I’m getting messages from women telling me how empowered they feel, and how confident they feel to wear that bikini again after having a baby. I hope that when people see my photo, they’ll feel encouraged to embrace themselves and give themselves grace. I look at my scar now, and I’m proud of what I went through. I embrace it. I’m still here. And that’s exactly what my photo shows. I just hope it can encourage others to feel the same.

Fox News: In 2018 you became a mom. But it sounded like you endured some challenges. What happened?

Hughes: My son was born in November 2018. During my pregnancy, I had nausea and all the typical things, but it wasn’t anything severe. I had a good pregnancy and I thought I was going to have a natural labor. I have read everything about natural labor, and I was ready for it. I never opened the door to the possibility of a C-section. I just wanted to bounce back as quickly as possible. I knew a C-section meant a longer recovery. But when I was in labor, unfortunately [the doctors] realized that my hips weren’t aligned. They were a bit shifted, which happens a lot in pregnancy. I didn’t realize this until it was time.

I had a very long labor – I was about 36 hours in, and I wasn’t dilating past seven centimeters. That’s when they recommended a C-section. At first, I was like, ""no, no, no."" But that was my first lesson in motherhood – you can’t plan for everything. I didn’t want to put my son’s health at risk or of course, my own. So I finally agreed. But two days later after I went home, I became really sick. I went back to the hospital, and it turned out I had a really bad infection. I spent eight days in the hospital and I underwent another surgery to remove the infection. Being separated from my son was so difficult. I wasn’t in the maternity unit anymore, and they didn’t want him in the hospital.

SI SWIM SEARCH FINALIST KRISTEN LOUELLE GAFFNEY, MOM OF TWO, UNVEILS CURVES ON MIAMI RUNWAY: 'MAGICAL MOMENT'

I just felt horrible. Like why did this happen to me? What did I do wrong? New moms especially, we put a lot of pressure on ourselves because we just want everything to be perfect. And the truth is, I don’t think this is discussed enough. There needs to be more conversations and education on all the million things that can happen during labor. But the most important thing is for mom and baby to be healthy. I wanted this perfect, natural birth to happen. It didn’t – and that’s OK. My son is here and so am I.

Fox News: After you gave birth and were recovering, did you still feel pressure to ""bounce back"" or look a certain way?

Hughes: I wish I could tell you that pressure went away I gave birth. It definitely didn’t. And I’m very honest about this… I’ve been modeling for 22 years. I have seen the fashion industry evolve in the last year and a half. But that shift hadn’t happened when I gave birth in November 2018. I did feel that pushback when I tried going back to work. I didn’t look the same as I did before. I certainly didn’t have the confidence.

I was very insecure. And I don’t think I was fully embraced quite yet. As a mom, you don’t always have time to go to the gym. Sometimes you don’t have time at all. And eating became whatever was in the house or whatever I could grab quickly, so I could get back to my son. My diet had changed. My routine had changed. The demands of my life had changed. But the truth is, once you give birth to a new person, you are not the same. So you shouldn’t feel pressure to be the same as you were before… It took time to finally embrace my scar and that’s OK. I no longer feel like I should be ashamed of it.

Fox News: What’s motherhood like today?

Hughes: It’s a blessing. I’m still modeling. My son and I did a photo shoot together for a company that offers clothing for breastfeeding moms. He was two months old. It was a little difficult because I wasn’t fully healed. I was still recovering from two surgeries. But it was an amazing experience. We’ve done quite a few photo shoots with him, and it’s been wonderful being with my son. He’s now three and a half, and it’s incredible.

Actor Ashton Kutcher recently disclosed his bout with an autoimmune condition that affected his hearing, vision and ability to walk.

Access Hollywood obtained footage of an interview from Monday night’s episode of National Geographic’s ""Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge,"" in which the actor spoke about a rare autoimmune disorder he developed not long ago called vasculitis.

The 44-year-old actor said in the interview, ""Two years ago, I had this weird, super-rare form of vasculitis, that, like, knocked out my vision, it knocked out my hearing, it knocked out, like, all my equilibrium,"" according to the Access Hollywood report.

ASHTON KUTCHER REVEALS VASCULITIS DIAGNOSIS, SAYS HE COULDN'T WALK, TALK OR HEAR

Kutcher also said in the interview, ""You don’t really appreciate it until it’s gone. Until you go, ‘I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to see again, I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to hear again, I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to walk again.’""

The Vasculitis Foundation says that ""vasculitis is a general term that refers to inflammation of the blood vessels.""

It notes as well, ""It is used to describe a family of nearly 20 rare diseases, characterized by narrowing, weakening or scarring of the blood vessels, which can restrict blood flow and damage vital organs and tissues.""

The disease can affect blood vessels such as arteries, capillaries and veins.

The Center for Vasculitis Care and Research at Cleveland Clinic said on its website that vasculitis is an autoimmune disease — in which the body mistakenly attacks its own healthy tissue — that contributes to inflammation of blood vessels.

Currently, researchers believe this inflammatory response may be triggered by infections, medications, environmental or genetic factors, allergic reactions or another disease process.

The disease can affect blood vessels such as arteries, capillaries and veins — and symptoms can range from mild to severe, and vary from person to person, the Cleveland Clinic experts said.

Symptoms also depend on the tissues and organs that are affected.

The actor said it took about a year for his senses to recover, according to the media report.

Rheumatologists said while some forms of vasculitis may improve on their own, others may require medical care throughout one’s life.

Treatment of the disease depends on the specific type of vasculitis and the areas/organs that are involved, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Treatment may include the use of corticosteroids — or, in some cases, medications that suppress the immune system.

Regardless of the severity, health experts said that early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important to avoid potentially life-threatening complications.

The actor said it took about a year for his senses to recover, according to the media report. ""I’m lucky to be alive,"" Kutcher said in the interview.

Scans of blood vessels and the heart, as well as tissue biopsies, may also be performed.

Common symptoms of the disease include the following list, according to the Ceveland Clinic.

Skin rashes

Fatigue

Weakness

Fever

Joint pains

Abdominal pain

Kidney problems (including dark or bloody urine)

Nerve problems (including numbness, weakness and pain)

Cough and/or shortness of breath

Also, other symptoms can occur, depending on the area of the body affected by vasculitis.

The Cleveland experts noted that if a small blood vessel is affected, it might break, producing small areas of bleeding in the tissue that appear as small red or purple dots on the skin.

They also noted a nodule or lump might be noticeable in the skin when a larger blood vessel close to the skin surface is inflamed.

A physician can diagnose vasculitis based on symptoms, a person’s medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests. Scans of blood vessels and the heart, as well as tissue biopsies, may also be performed, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Kutcher, who shares two children with his wife Mila Kunis — whom he met when they filmed their hit TV series, ""That '70s Show"" — spoke about overcoming challenges.

""The minute you start seeing your obstacles as things that are made for you, to give you what you need, and then life starts to get fun, right?"" Kutcher said in the Bear Grylls interview, according to Access Hollywood.

Italy opened its vaccination campaign against monkeypox on Monday as case numbers have increased at a time when health authorities are reporting vaccine shortages worldwide.

Italy has reported 545 cases of monkeypox, according to the health ministry. Its vaccination campaign has started more than a month after other countries that have seen higher numbers of cases, including the United States, Britain and Spain.

The first doses will be given at the Spallanzani hospital in Rome, the hospital said in a statement.

SPAIN CONFIRMS FIRST MONKEYPOX-RELATED DEATH IN EUROPE

Vaccines and treatments have been in short supply and the disease often left for historically underfunded sexual health clinics to manage.

Spallanzani said it already has 200 people who will be vaccinated from Monday onwards, as well as 600 requests for bookings.

The vaccine used will be Jynneos (MVA-BN), a smallpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic and approved by the European Medicines Agency for protection against monkeypox, the hospital said.

On Thursday, vaccinations will also begin in Italy's financial capital, Milan.

The virus continues to be largely transmitted among gay and bisexual men in the current outbreak spreading outside endemic countries, which began in May. Monkeypox is spread chiefly by close contact, causes pus-filled sores and flu-like symptoms, and is rarely fatal. There have now been 26,500 cases worldwide outside the countries where it usually spreads, according to a Reuters tracker.

In July, the World Health Organization declared monkeypox a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" its highest alert level.

Following the WHO's move, the United States — which now has the most cases in the world — also declared monkeypox a public health emergency on Aug. 4.

Italy's Health ministry said gay, bisexual men and transgender people who have recently had sex with multiple partners, recently had a sexually transmitted infection or use chemical drugs when having sex, would be eligible for the vaccine. Hospital staff dealing with monkeypox cases are also eligible.

The first case in Italy was recorded on May 20, 2022. There are no current plans for mass vaccinations.

""Based on the weather radar, we decided to deviate north and were still getting very strong returns on the onboard weather radar,"" Frans said.

Frans said they had to veer north across Lake Superior to stay out of the worst of it.

A bumpy ride awaits those who dare enter

But along the journey of their equipment reposition flight, Frans documented rapid development of the cumulonimbus clouds, as heat from below raced skyward into the much cooler atmosphere, exploding into convection along the way. The flat tops of the storms in the distance are informally known as anvil tops due to their obvious resemblance to anvils.

HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER ON TV

Anvils are caused when the rising air hits a stable layer of the atmosphere where the temperature profile prevents the clouds from rising further, instead acting like an invisible wall where the clouds will then spread out along the boundary layer. They're signs of a mature thunderstorm and something you want to avoid flying through as a pilot.

""We would have probably encountered at least moderate turbulence and likely worse,"" Frans said. ""Generally the tops of clouds – especially cumulus – dump a TON of ice into the airframe as you fly through, so the windshield (where it's not heated) would instantly be covered in ice.""

What's more, with temperatures below freezing and strong updrafts in the clouds, the precipitation you'd be flying through is not rain, but hail.

Abundant amounts of moisture building up along the front will fuel the development of numerous showers and thunderstorms through midweek, enhancing the flash flood threat, especially in areas where the ground is already saturated from heavy rain and flooding in recent weeks.

On Monday evening, heavy downpours turned streets into rivers in Maryland. The video below shows the water rushing down roads in Landover Hills, less than 10 miles northeast of Washington.

""For the next two days, any of our thunderstorms can produce very quick flooding,"" said FOX Weather meteorologist Britta Merwin. ""That means street flooding is going to be a large concern, especially in some of these areas where we have higher terrain and areas that are hard hit from the past historic floods.

Local NAACP chapters, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, criminal defense lawyers and other civil rights advocacy groups endorsed automatic expungement, and it could broaden support for the initiative among Republican criminal justice advocates. Seven other states with legal recreational marijuana have also adopted automatic expungement policies.

Marijuana sales would be taxed at 6% under the Missouri measure. The tax is estimated to bring in more than $46 million during the first full year the amendment is in effect and close to $70 million the following year. Revenues would be earmarked for veterans’ homes, drug treatment programs and public defenders.

Cities and other municipalities could enact local sales taxes on recreational marijuana up to 3% or enact local bans on non-medical marijuana sales by a public vote.

Ashcroft said a separate proposal to allow ranked-choice voting failed to collect the roughly 170,000 voter signatures from six of the state’s eight congressional districts to get on the ballot.

Under that proposal, candidates from all parties would have been listed on primary ballots beginning in August 2024, meaning voters could pick from Republicans and Democrats without requesting a party-specific ballot. The top four candidates with the most votes would move on to the general election, when voters could either pick only their favorite or rank the candidates from first to last.

Better Elections spokesman Scott Charton said in a statement that proponents would honor supporters ""with continued work"" on the issue.
