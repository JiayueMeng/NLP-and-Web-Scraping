The folders shown above are the updates we made during the year. I have to say it's kind of messy :(, so I basically build a new one for all the functions and py files we use now for SVM!

Main method is the one you can run directly. This will give you a csv that can be used for SVM test. Webcrawler is the one used to getting data from the faculty pages, and word counter has the methods to extract and filter the meaningful words from the data we get. univcombine contains methods to combining several data of different universities together so that we can try our method in a larger scale, and this might need to change a bit for you to use. csvprocessor contains the method to getting relative frequency of all the words we have, and word choose method is the one to choose the most 20 words among all the words.

The csv files in the newest update directory is the one that you can use to see how the whole thing works. Basically you can just use the csv files as data to see the accuracy, and I believe the overall acuracy is flowing around 0.8. One important thing is that we forget to write the catogories of different website beforehand, so the comments in ipynb file inside update 7.17 will tell you which test for which university belongs to which department. 

More detailed comments are written inside all the files, so please look at them one by one. In reality we can run the main method beforehand, get the csv file we need, and then use  svm method or other to test it. the svm method is the ipynb. Please let me know if you have any trouble running or accessing any of those files!
