As mentioned before, this folder contains all the data we collected. The function used are inside SVM folder. Basically we have tried distinguishing between two departments (physics and history), as well as three departments (physics, history, and computer science), and we use the data from faculty pages of those five universities: Harvard University (not all, partial), MIT, Stanford, UofR, and Vanderbilt University. The list will go on as we using more accurate and faster methods!
