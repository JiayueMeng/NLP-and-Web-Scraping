Mortgage rates dropped last week to their lowest level since April, offering some relief to prospective home buyers who have faced higher rates and soaring prices for real estate. According to data from Freddie Mac, the 30-year loan, the most popular among new homeowners, dipped back below the 5% mark.

The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 4.99% for the week ending August 4, which was down from the week before when it averaged 5.3%, according to the mortgage giant’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey. Last week’s figure was still significantly higher than the 2.77% figure the year before.

""When you have the factor of higher mortgage rates, meaning it’s probably harder to buy, people lean towards renting,"" Roschelle told host Stuart Varney.

""When the job market’s strong they are employed, so they can afford rent and inflation just raises the price of everything.""

On Friday it was revealed that U.S. job growth unexpectedly accelerated in July, defying fears of a slowdown in hiring even as the labor market confronts the twin threats of scorching-hot inflation and rising interest rates.

Employers added 528,000 jobs in July, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, blowing past the 250,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, edged down to 3.5%, the lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic began more than two years ago.

EVERY DAY THEY'RE HUSTLING! INFLATION PROMPTS INCREASE IN SIDE GIGS AMID ‘GOOD’ JOB MARKET, SAYS EXPERT



Meantime, the Labor Department revealed last month that inflation accelerated more than expected to a new four-decade high in June.

The department said the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 9.1% in June from a year ago. Prices jumped 1.3% in the one-month period from May. Those figures were both far higher than the 8.8% headline figure and 1% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists.

The data marked the fastest pace of inflation since December 1981.

Shelter costs – which account for roughly one-third of the CPI – sped up again in June, climbing 0.6%, matching an 18-year-high set in May. On an annual basis, shelter costs have climbed 5.6%, the fastest since February 1991.

Rent costs also surged in June, jumping 0.8% over the month, the largest monthly increase since April 1986. Rising rents are a concerning development because higher housing costs most directly and acutely affect household budgets.

July’s inflation data will be released on Wednesday.



POWELL SAYS THERE IS NO GUARANTEE FED CAN TAMP DOWN INFLATION WITHOUT HURTING THE JOB MARKET

Roschelle noted that if rent is more expensive, ""discretionary spending items go by the wayside and then people start taking second jobs just to do what? Feed themselves, food and shelter.""

""It’s crazy, but that’s exactly what happened during the ’70s,"" he continued.

Roschelle noted that he reviewed data from the 1970s and said that the dynamics are ""identical to what they are right now.""

""And what happened in the ’70s? Rents went through the roof, so it’s eerily reminiscent of the Carter days,"" he warned. Americans had experienced an inflation spike in the 1970s, which posed a big shock to the economy.

U.S. existing home sales dropped to a fresh two-year low in June as rising mortgage rates and the relentless increase in home values slowed activity by edging prospective homebuyers out of the market.



Sales of previously owned homes tumbled 5.4% in June from the previous month to an annual rate of 5.12 million units, the lowest level since June 2020, according to data released late last month by the National Association of Realtors. It marks the fifth consecutive month that sales have declined. On an annual basis, home sales plunged 14.2% in June.

The slowdown in sales came as the national median home price surged higher in June, hitting a new record of $416,000. That's up 13.4% from the previous year and is an increase from a revised $408,400 in May.

The interest rate sensitive housing market has started to cool noticeably in recent months as the Federal Reserve moves to tighten policy at the fastest pace in three decades. Policymakers already approved a 75-basis point rate increase in both June and July.

Following the rate hikes, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to nearly 6% in June, though they've since moderated.

Pointing to existing and new home sales data, Roschelle noted that, overall, the housing market is ""slowing down dramatically,"" but stressed there ""is so much demand for housing that it’s not going to cause a crash.""

Investors’ biggest worry, according to Carroll, remains Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and its impact on markets.

""As I talk to investors, that's their number one fear,"" the real estate expert said. ""You might be seeing the bonds react temporarily, but I think over time they're going back up.""

Predicting mortgage rates will climb upward in the long-term, Carroll noted that could mean prices of single-family homes, which experts have warned are in scarcely low inventory, will decrease.

New home sales in June fell to the lowest level since April 2020, signaling declining builder sentiment as construction bottlenecks continue to slow new home building and raise housing costs, NAHB noted in a news release.

The association pointed to data by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Census Bureau, which revealed that sales of newly built, single-family homes in June fell 8.1% from May and that new home sales dropped 13.4% in 2022 year-to-date.

NAHB Chairman Jerry Konter, who is a home builder and developer from Savannah, Ga., noted that, ""builders saw sales decline significantly as buyers were priced out of the market on higher interest rates,"" also attributing the decline to the ongoing home building and development costs, including building materials.

NAHB’s assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis, Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, pointed out that ""deteriorating affordability conditions and growing sticker shock"" are contributing to the latest trends, as ""only 14% of new home sales in June were priced below $300,000"" compared to 27% the same time last year.

The median sales price of a new single-family home dipped to $402,400 in June, down 9.5% compared to May, but is up 7.4% compared to the same time last year, the NAHB reported.

""Right now I would say that for new homes it is very, very tough to sell it and make a profit on it - and so they are not going to build it if they can’t,"" Howard told Varney Wednesday.



HOUSING STARTS IN JUNE PLUNGE TO LOWEST LEVEL IN 9 MONTHS

Last month it was revealed that builder confidence plunged in July amid soaring inflation and increased interest rates, which stalled the housing market by dramatically slowing sales and traffic from prospective buyers.

Home builder confidence in the market for newly-built single-family homes dropped 12 points lower to 55 in July, its seventh consecutive monthly decline, according to the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) released last month.

The index can range between 0 and 100 with any print over 50 indicating positive sentiment. Any reading above 80 signals strong demand.

The data marked the lowest HMI reading since May 2020 and the largest single-month drop in the history of the index, with the exception of the 42-point drop in April 2020, the association noted.

Speaking on ""Varney & Co."" last month following the release of builder confidence data, Howard stressed that there is no doubt that it provides a clear sign that the housing market is slowing.

On Wednesday, FOX Business’ Madison Alworth reported that realtors noted a slowdown in the market.

Realtor Linda Okupski of Keller Williams Real Estate in New Jersey explained how the market has changed over the past few months, noting that certain factors that didn’t make a difference last year, matter a lot more now.

Okupski said she ""could sell a cardboard box under a bridge last year and have a markup of an incredible amount of money,"" but ""now the condition of the house matters, the pricing of the house matters and how you market the house.""

Real estate company Redfin noted in a news release last month that homebuyers are getting some relief as sellers slash their prices at a record rate.

Redfin also said that the portion of homes going for above list price fell for the first time since June 2020 as sellers reacted to slowing demand from homebuyers amid the economic landscape.

Ratiu calculated the mortgage payments for a median-priced home on Realtor.com in June. For a home listed at around $450,000, with a 20% down payment and 30-year fixed mortgage rate, the mortgage rate came to about $2,100, which is a nearly 60% year-over-year jump, according to Ratiu.

Some homebuyers had to drop out of the buying market completely and face the rental market, while others are still in the game but ""are a lot less willing to bid over asking price or entertain homes that are overpriced,"" Fairweather added.

Since buyers are ""more jittery,"" sellers are making concessions and dropping prices. Fairweather said sellers no longer have the luxury of choosing between dozens of offers like they would have had earlier this year.

Boise, Idaho, had the biggest share of buyers, 61.5%, that dropped their asking prices, according to the analysis. That's up from 25.7% in June 2021.

Boise, Salt Lake City, Sacramento and Tampa were popular hotspots between summer 2020 and March 2022, ""as homebuyers moved in from pricey coastal job centers, taking advantage of low mortgage rates and remote work,"" according to Redfin.

However, their popularity worked against them.

""Their popularity led to heated competition for a limited supply of homes for sale, pushing up prices and making them unaffordable for many buyers,"" the report continued.

For instance, the typical home in Boise sold for $550,000 in May, 60% higher than two years ago, according to the report. Similarly, prices for the typical home in Sacramento increased 44% to $610,000.

""Consumer sentiment is also making home buyers more reluctant to stretch their budgets,"" Fairweather added.

Not only are homebuyers worried about inflation continuing to rise, but they are also concerned about what would happen if the economy falls into a recession and unemployment rates increase, according to Fairweather.

The interest rate-sensitive housing market has started to cool noticeably in recent months as the Federal Reserve moves to tighten policy at the fastest pace in three decades. Policymakers already approved a 75-basis point rate increase in June and are expected to approve another of that magnitude at the end of July.

Following the rate hikes, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage – the most popular among new homeowners – climbed to nearly 6% in June, though they've since moderated. The average rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage hovered around 5.51% for the week ending July 14, according to recent data from mortgage lender Freddie Mac.

The real estate expert provided the insight on the same day it was revealed that U.S. existing home sales dropped to a fresh two-year low in June as rising mortgage rates and the relentless increase in home values slowed activity by edging prospective homebuyers out of the market.

Sales of previously owned homes tumbled 5.4% in June from the previous month to an annual rate of 5.12 million units, the lowest level since June 2020, according to new data released by the National Association of Realtors. It marks the fifth consecutive month that sales have declined. On an annual basis, home sales plunged 14.2% in June.

The slowdown in sales came as the national median home price surged higher in June, hitting a new record of $416,000. That's up 13.4% from the previous year and is an increase from a revised $408,400 in May.

Campins noted that there is still is ""very low supply.""

She added that ""some buyers have regressed out of the market and sellers are waiting for them to come back in"" due to the current market conditions.

""What we’re beginning to see is even with the rise in interest rates, some people are now turning to an ARM or an adjustable-rate mortgage, which is very different than what we’ve seen in recent years,"" she explained. ""That is basically you get an ARM for five to seven years. The rate doesn’t change during that time and then it will adjust after that.""

""The reason for that, the old saying is, ‘You marry the house and date the rate,’ so if you still find a house in this market that you love, you can always refinance later on,"" she continued.

There were about 1.26 million homes for sale at the end of June, according to the report released Wednesday, an increase of 2.4% from one year ago. It is the first annual gain in three years. At the current pace of sales, it would take roughly three months to exhaust the inventory of existing homes – up from 2.6 months one year ago. Experts view a pace of six to seven months as a healthy level.

Campins added that ""some markets are doing better than others"" and ""we are beginning to see more inventory, which is a good thing for buyers because we had such a low amount of supply in the market.""

""There has been a lack of concerted governmental effort across all Western Europe, Western economies, for decades to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of affordable housing,"" Cain International CEO Jonathan Goldstein said on ""Mornings with Maria"" Wednesday.

""What they've done is they put blockages and regulatory and red tape problems in front of developers, and there is no concerted political focus on this as a problem, and be that from the right or be that from the left, the same problem,"" he continued.

The property developer admitted the market is showing ""really nervous signs"" after new home construction in the U.S. hit a nine-month low in June, dropping 2% from May.

""That's a 50% rise in people's mortgage rates during a time when they can least afford it because they're experiencing nearly double-digit inflation across all their household goods that they're buying.

Howard provided the insight on the same day it was revealed that builder confidence plunged in July amid soaring inflation and increased interest rates, which stalled the housing market by dramatically slowing sales and traffic from prospective buyers, according to the association.

Home builder confidence in the market for newly-built single-family homes dropped 12 points lower to 55 in July, its seventh consecutive monthly decline according to the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) released on Monday.

The index can range between 0 and 100 with any print over 50 indicating positive sentiment. Any reading above 80 signals strong demand.

HOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE MISSED THE MARK ON SURGING INFLATION

The data released Monday marks the lowest HMI reading since May 2020 and the largest single-month drop in the history of the index, with the exception of the 42-point drop in April 2020, the association noted.

Speaking on ""Varney & Co."" on Monday, Howard stressed that there is no doubt that the data provides a clear sign that the housing market is slowing.

""For the last seven straight months it has been going down and this is a huge drop - and I think all it says is, ‘Somebody do something or we’re going to go into a recession,’"" Howard said.

He then argued that the ""only way to bring down housing costs is to bring down the cost of building materials, fix the supply chain, negotiate a lumber deal with Canada, [and] deregulate some of the regulations that are unnecessary.""

""We hope that policymakers will take this as sort of a last cry for help,"" he added.

The Federal Reserve has been hiking rates in an effort to tame inflation, which now sits at a fresh 40-year high, and the moves have been impacting the housing market in the form of higher mortgage rates.

Though mortgage rates do not follow the federal funds rate, they do typically follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury.

NAHB Chairman Jerry Konter, who is a home builder and developer from Georgia, noted in a news release that ""production bottlenecks, rising home building costs and high inflation are causing many builders to halt construction because the cost of land, construction and financing exceeds the market value of the home.""

""In another sign of a softening market, 13% of builders in the HMI survey reported reducing home prices in the past month to bolster sales and/or limit cancellations,"" he continued.

Howard noted on Monday that ""we’re starting to see slowdowns"" as it pertains to demand.

PENDING HOME SALES UNEXPECTEDLY BREAK SIX-MONTH LOSING STREAK IN MAY

Even though lease signings rose from May, they dropped nearly 50% since June 2021.

The issue is that mortgage rates, which are ""surging after the pivot in the Fed policy this spring,"" are pushing more consumers out of the homebuying market, Miller Samuel CEO Jonathan Miller told FOX Business.

Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the 30-year rate rose to 5.51% from 5.30% last week. One year ago the average 30-year rate was 2.88%.

Ron DeSantis and Republican state lawmakers recently took a major step toward fighting back against woke corporations parroting Biden’s leftist agenda.

According to a press release by DeSantis’ office, his proposed legislation, will target environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. It’s a move that will, if successful, go a long way toward protecting individual liberty and promoting free-market economics. His bill, which will be introduced formally during the 2023 legislative session, would ""Prohibit big banks, credit card companies and money transmitters from discriminating against customers for their religious, political, or social beliefs.""

It would also ""Prohibit State Board of Administration (SBA) fund managers from considering ESG factors when investing the state’s money"" and mandate that SBA fund managers ""only consider maximizing the return on investment on behalf of Florida’s retirees.""

DESANTIS SPIKES FOOTBALL AFTER MAJOR EMPLOYER DITCHES CHICAGO FOR FLORIDA

In Florida, the SBA is responsible for managing and investing the assets of the state’s retirement system and other funds.

ESG scores are a kind of social credit scoring system that is now widely being used by woke corporations and Wall Street investors to promote the Biden administration’s far-left agenda, all without having to pass a law through Congress or a state legislature.

ESG scores turn market economics on its head, by rewarding companies based on non-financial, non-business metrics that have absolutely nothing to do with supply and demand. For example, one highly influential ESG system promoted by the World Economic Forum rates companies based on their ""Percentage of employees per employee category, by age group, gender and other indicators of diversity (e.g. ethnicity).""

In other words, under many ESG models, a company with the ""wrong"" ratio of Asian to Hispanic workers would receive a lower ESG social credit score than a business that might sell goods and services that are of a lower quality, but that has a ratio of certain racial groups that’s deemed desirable by corporate elites.

Similarly, ESG metrics punish companies that use too much water or land, aren’t committed to adopting various parts of the Biden administration’s climate change agenda, and don’t engage in community activism.

Many of America’s largest banks, including companies like Bank of America, investment managers like BlackRock, and big-tech companies such as Microsoft have pledged to use ESG scores to help transform society so that it's in line with numerous left-wing goals, especially those related to climate change.

In fact, every one of America’s six largest banks — Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo — have committed to using ESG and their financial might to force the U.S. economy to produce net-zero carbon dioxide emissions, a decision that is having an absolutely disastrous effect on investment in fossil-fuel development at a time when gas prices are near their all-time highs.

ESG scores have also been used to deny access to capital or payment services for gun manufacturers and other legal businesses hated by left-wing elites.

ESG has been used to discriminate against those who hold social and political views corporate leaders don’t like. For example, the conservative group Moms for Liberty claims payment processor PayPal froze its assets because of the organization’s ideological views.

DeSantis’s proposed legislation, which was rolled out in partnership with Florida’s incoming speaker of the House, Rep. Paul Renner, would put pressure on investment management firms to avoid ESG by preventing many of Florida’s public investments from being used to promote ESG. It would also prohibit banks from using ESG metrics to discriminate against customers on the basis of their religious, political or social beliefs.

The detailed legislative language included in DeSantis’s proposal has yet to be released publicly, and, unfortunately, it appears DeSantis’s legislation would not stop the use of all forms of ESG discrimination. For example, it appears under his proposal, banks could deny access to banking services to customers who refuse to buy electric cars or choose not to put solar panels on the roofs of their home or business.

Despite these flaws, however, the proposal offered by DeSantis and Republicans in Florida’s state legislature are a huge step in the right direction.

Banks, financial institutions, and investment managers should not be allowed to use their economic power to make an end run around the Constitution and democratic institutions by discriminating against businesses and individuals based on non-financial considerations.

Hopefully, lawmakers in other states will soon take notice of the tremendous progress being made to stop these practices in Florida and make similar, perhaps even stronger efforts to stop the rise of ESG."

Really.

MANCHIN-SCHUMER SPENDING BILL COULD ELIMINATE 30,000 JOBS, NEW ANALYSIS SHOWS

By raising taxes in a recession, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-WV, is breaking his word to West Virginians. In 2010 when he asked voters to send him to the Senate, Manchin said: ""I don’t think during a time of recession you mess with any of the taxes or increase any taxes.""

Manchin announced his surprise tax-hike deal just as news confirmed the U.S. had its second consecutive quarter of negative GDP growth.

Even Barack Obama knows it is a bad idea to raise taxes in a recession. Obama said: ""The last thing you want to do is to raise taxes in the middle of a recession.""

The Democrat tax-and-spending bill is good for some: the Internal Revenue Service. Democrats plan to shovel $80 billion to the IRS to hire 87,000 more IRS agents. What will they do? The IRS has already announced a goal to increase small business audits by 50%.

Small businesses are barely keeping the lights on, battered by government-forced shutdowns and higher costs. Now the Democrats want to bury them in IRS paperwork and fishing-expedition audits that can easily last two to three years.

Small business owners are busy. They can’t afford teams of lawyers and accountants, and many will just give up even if they did nothing wrong, just to get the IRS off their backs.

Meanwhile, the IRS only answers the phone ""19 or 20 percent"" of the time. The Democrats plan to spend 14 times as much money for ""enforcement"" (audits) than for ""taxpayer services"" (answering the phone).

But wait. There is more. The IRS will spend more of your money to buy new cars for themselves, despite the fact that the inspector general found the IRS vehicle fleet is already too large, and the agency fails to ensure they are used only for official business. The watchdog report found ""questionable and missing information reported by special agents for commutes and commuting miles.""

In other words, the IRS would fail one of its own audits. The IRS puts the screws to small business owners if they cannot properly document vehicle mileage. Meanwhile, the IRS’s own books are a disaster because they know there are no consequences.

Democrats like to pretend the IRS is broke, but the agency’s actual spending behavior proves otherwise.

The bill also gives the IRS an extra pot of money for new offices even though the agency chief admits that 53% of IRS employees never bother to come into the office. They ""work"" at home. The IRS should be downsizing its physical office presence, not increasing it.

Why all this money for the IRS which regularly fails to manage itself competently?

The IRS union gives 100% of its PAC contributions to Democrats.

More IRS agents means more dues and more employee political contributions which find their way back to Democrat campaign accounts. Coincidence?

Democrats have named this tax and spending blowout the ""Inflation Reduction Act of 2022."" They know Americans are angry about the inflation they see every day at the grocery store and the gas station. So rather than stop the overspending that created inflation, they will spend more, tax more, and relabel the bill ""anti-inflation.""

They think the problem is one of communication rather than the reality of President Joe Biden repeating all the failures of President Jimmy Carter with all the same unpleasant results.

This tax-and-spending bill is best understood as pork-barrel spending larded up with earmarked goodies for special interests.

Many of the failed ideas in this legislation date back to the ""Great Society"" welfare spending. The bill also imposes price controls on U.S. drug manufacturers enforced by a 95% federal excise tax. Wage-and-price controls have created shortages and higher prices for 3,000 years of recorded history.

The inflation and recession we now suffer under were created by the Democrats and the Biden administration through their $2 trillion spending spree and the threats of new taxes and regulations.

Now the Democrats offer more of the same as the solution to the problem they created. This will not end well.

But the worst thing about this bill is the crushing effect it will have on American manufacturing.

The tax portion of Democrats’ imaginatively named ""Inflation Reduction Act"" hinges on something called the book-income minimum tax.

Basically, this means corporations would pay a 15 percent minimum tax on the income they report to their shareholders.

MANCHIN-SCHUMER SPENDING BILL COULD ELIMINATE 30,000 JOBS, NEW ANALYSIS SHOWS

According to Congress’s non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation, American manufacturers would take the hit for 49.7 percent of this tax.

That means half of the $313 billion this plan is expected to redistribute will come from U.S. manufacturing industry we’re already struggling to keep here in the U.S.

They should have called it the Manufacturing Reduction Act.

Manufacturing is already hurting from the Biden recession. In a new report out this week from the Institute for Supply Management, U.S. manufacturing expansion has cooled to its slowest pace since the locked-down summer of 2020.

It’s no mystery why U.S. manufacturing is slowing: Americans are cutting back due to Biden’s 9.1 percent inflation pay cut, and supply is stacking up.

And we know who will end up taking the hit from this harebrained scheme: American manufacturing workers and American consumers.

But it’s not just the larger manufacturers that will take a hit from this bill.

Small manufacturers often rely upon large manufacturers as their primary customers. For example, over half of Americans who work in machine shops or screw, nut, and bolt manufacturers work in firms with less than 50 employees.

When you hike taxes for large manufacturers, they buy less from small manufacturers. The negative effects of this tax hike will be felt in small communities across the country.

This bill also includes $80 billion to double the size of the IRS and hire 80,000 new agents to shake America’s couch cushions for every last cent to blow on failed social programs.

The IRS already announced last year it would be increasing the number of small businesses it audits by 50 percent, and that’s before this proposed $80 billion boost to their operating budget.

Large corporations retain teams of lawyers to deal with IRS audits. Small businesses don’t, and this extra hassle adds one more insult to the injury of 9.1 percent inflation.

What's more, the unemployment rate is usually a lagging indicator of recessions.","The Commerce Department confirmed Thursday what ordinary Americans and small business owners already know by indicating the economy is in a recession.

On Thursday, the Commerce Department estimated GDP fell by 0.9% in the second quarter after falling by 1.6% in the first quarter, meaning the economy has contracted for two consecutive quarters, meeting the traditional definition of a recession long used by economists.

Don't expect this memo to reach the White House, which has been busy trying to prebut Thursday's GDP release by claiming this longstanding recession definition is inaccurate, and the economy is not in recession.

BIDEN SAYS 'NO SURPRISE' ECONOMY 'SLOWING DOWN' AS ECONOMY ENTERS TECHNICAL RECESSION

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen claimed on ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that ""even if that [second quarter GDP] number is negative, we are not in a recession now. I would warn that we should be not characterizing that as a recession."" National Economic Council Director Brian Deese echoed her comments at a press briefing on Tuesday.

This administration's gaslighting ignores that the two-quarter benchmark is widely accepted, and that, according to University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith, ""There has never been an occasion in which GDP contracted for two consecutive quarters and a recession was not eventually declared.""

Team Biden's recession revisionism is channeling Groucho Marx, who said, ""Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?"" It is a desperate and shameful attempt to move the recession goalposts to prevent Biden from being labeled a recession President. This distinction will further hurt Democrats' chances in the midterm elections this fall.

Yet even following the White House's request to take ""a holistic look at the data"" still indicates the economy is in recession. The fastest inflation in 41 years has led to falling real wages and living standards. Sky-high gas prices are causing immense pain at the pump. And financial markets had their worst start of the year since 1970.

US ECONOMY ENTERS TECHNICAL RECESSION AFTER GROWTH TUMBLES 0.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER

Middle-class Americans are being squeezed from both sides as their cost of living increases and their savings decrease. No wonder consumer and small business confidence are at record lows. No matter how the administration tries to slice it, the economy is in recession.

The Biden administration continues to point to the nation's supposedly strong labor market to back up its claims. On Sunday, Sec. Yellen said she'd be ""amazed"" if the U.S. were in a recession because ""we've got a very strong labor market.""

The topline unemployment rate of 3.6% indeed seems low. But it is being driven by a declining labor force participation rate, which is still far below its pre-pandemic level and has fallen in recent months.

Rather than playing semantic games, the Biden administration should spend its time working on getting the country out of this recession of its own making. That means opposing the tax-and-spend reconciliation bill agreed to on Wednesday by Senate Democrats. This bill would increase spending by $400 billion and raise taxes by $700 billion, fueling inflation and killing jobs at the worst possible time, prolonging the recession.

Yet as the saying goes, the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem. Team Biden's first step to getting the economy back on track is admitting today's recession reality.

It's a significant uptick from November 2020, when 3.2 million people quit. It didn't stop there. BLS data shows another record 4.5 million Americans quit in March 2022.

""Ultimately, employees moving to new roles and new organizations are really looking for what makes them happy, and often the sentiment is that more money equals a happier life,"" he said. ""For instance, sign-on bonuses seem great, but is it being offered because the organization's culture isn't one that cultivates value and fulfillment in its employees?""

Carden stressed that it's vital for employees to do their due diligence and to look into the offer and company before taking the job.

Still, ""to help retain employees, businesses have the responsibility to cultivate an environment of clarity, alignment and purpose that connects employees to business goals and objectives where they feel valued and trusted,"" he added.

Morgan agreed, saying that it is in the employer's benefit to focus on the wellness of their staff and ensure that workers are satisfied with the culture of the workplace.

""Organizations that are navigating the impacts of inflation and constricting budgets are facing tough business decisions, but it does cost much less money and is better for company morale overall to reskill and redeploy existing talent rather than overhauling workforces entirely,"" he added.

That said, Morgan argued that Great Resignation has shifted how companies prepare for a possible recession. Rather than instituting massive layoffs, ""organizations are doing what they can to hold onto their talent even through a recession because they’ve seen how scarce talent is and that turnover is more costly in the long run,"" he said.

Oil prices slipped on Tuesday as traders eyed the latest progress in last-ditch talks to revive the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, which would clear the way to boost its crude exports in a tight market.

Brent crude futures were down 86 cents, or 0.9%, at $95.79 a barrel at 0725 GMT, after gaining 1.8% in the previous session.

However, signs that demand may not be dented by weakening global growth as much as feared are keeping a floor under the market for now, following stronger-than-expected trade data from China on the weekend and the surprising acceleration in U.S. jobs growth in July.

The oil market has remained under pressure recently over global recession fears, with Brent prices suffering their biggest weekly drop since April 2020 last week.

""This all hits middle-income Americans,"" Norquist stressed. ""The president knows that; he lied.""

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT: WHAT TAX HIKES ARE IN THE BILL?

""He signed anyway So did Senator Sinema from Arizona; she knew better than this and still signed on,"" he continued.

Norquist stressed that, while President Biden repeatedly promised during his presidency and campaign not to raise taxes on any American earning less than $400,000 a year, the Democrats' spending and tax bill will raise taxes for everyone.

After months of painstaking negotiations, Senate Democrats on Sunday approved the sweeping health care and climate change spending package that amounts to one of the largest tax hikes in decades.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 – which passed along party lines with Democrats employing the budget reconciliation process – would raise an estimated $739 billion over the next decade, with the revenues going toward initiatives designed to combat climate change and curb pharmaceutical prices, as well as efforts to reduce the nation's $30 trillion debt.

It includes about $433 billion in new spending, while roughly $300 billion of the new revenue raised would go toward paying down the nation's deficit. Democrats say the legislation will help to reduce inflation and provide relief to Americans in the form of lower health care costs, while Republicans argue the measure does little to tackle higher prices – and could actually exacerbate the crisis.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in an analysis last week that the spending bill will have a negligible impact on inflation.



US ECONOMY ENTERS TECHNICAL RECESSION AFTER GROWTH TUMBLES 0.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER

The bill, which now heads to the House for a vote that could happen as soon as Friday, is a far cry from the ambitious $2 trillion agenda that President Biden rolled out last year that relied on major tax increases on wealthy Americans and corporations.



""This bill is far from perfect. It's a compromise. But it's often how progress is made,"" Biden said at the White House last week. ""My message to Congress is this: This is the strongest bill you can pass.""

""The president should be concerned because Congress made a liar out of him,"" Norquist said on Tuesday. ""His biggest promise was that he would never would raise taxes on anyone who earned less than $400,000 a year.""

He then noted that tax increase listed in the bill on the production of natural gas, crude oil and coal impacts all Americans.

""These hit everyone directly,"" he stressed. ""They raise the cost of energy [and] they make people poorer.""

Norquist then pointed to the fact that, under the legislation, the Internal Revenue Service would receive $80 billion in order to enhance tax enforcement by hiring more agents and introducing new technology to pursue tax dodgers.

Democrats expect a beefed-up IRS to add an extra $124 billion in revenue by cracking down on tax evasion by wealthy individuals and corporations.



HOW DEMOCRATS' BEEFED-UP IRS COULD HURT LOW-INCOME AMERICANS

According to an analysis released by House Republicans, Americans who earn less than $75,000 per year are slated to receive 60% of the additional tax audits expected under Democrats' spending package.

The analysis, which is a conservative estimate based upon recent audit rates and tax filing data, shows that individuals with an annual income of $75,000 or less would be subject to 710,863 additional Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits while those making more than $1 million would receive 52,295 more audits under the bill. The Inflation Reduction Act would roughly double the IRS' budget to increase enforcement and, therefore, federal tax revenue.

""There is not more money from big companies or from rich people; they have been fully audited for years. They’re [the IRS] going after - if you read their literature, middle-income - self-employed people."" Norquist argued. ""That's their target.""

He then pointed to the measure’s 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases that is poised to take effect in 2023. Democrats – who estimated this new levy will raise about $74 billion over the next decade – are hoping to slow companies' tendency to buy back their own stock from investors.

Norquist argued that ""if a company buys back its stock - which increases the value of stock for people with an IRA, or 401(k), or if you are a government employee and your pension is backed by stocks held for you by your city or state - you are going to see the value of your life savings go down.""

He stressed that ""half the country"" invests in the stock market through IRA or 401(k) accounts.

""Half the country has already been damaged by the president’s damage to the stock market, the value of people’s life savings,"" Norquist argued.

""If you’re saving your money in cash, he’s inflated it down to where it is worth less than it used to be; if you got into the stock market, it’s worth less than when he walked into office.""

""There is language in this bill that provides some guidelines, but it's not at all a guarantee,"" William McBride, the vice president of federal tax and economic policy at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, told FOX Business in an interview.

""The fact of the matter is most returns report income under $100,000,"" he continued. ""That's where the money is, so to speak.""

McBride added that middle-class Americans aren't able to afford the same resources as wealthy individuals to avoid scrutiny.

Following the rate hikes, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage – the most popular among new homeowners – climbed to nearly 6% in June, though they've since moderated. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage hovered around 4.99% for the week ending Aug. 4, according to recent data from mortgage lender Freddie Mac.

That is significantly higher than just one year ago, when rates stood at 2.77%.

After former President Trump 's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida was raided by FBI agents, Republicans are slamming the Biden administration and accusing the Department of Justice of ""political weaponization,"" while Democrats are lauding the agency for holding Trump accountable for ""wrongdoing.""

""The raid of MAL is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves,"" said Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. ""Now the Regime is getting another 87k IRS agents to wield against its adversaries? Banana Republic.""

Multiple sources tell Fox News the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago is related to the materials Trump allegedly brought to his private residence after his presidency concluded. That matter was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy issued a warning to Attorney General Merrick Garland that extensive oversight by Republicans in Congress will be heading his way.

However, ""Squad"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said the FBI is working toward ""accountability"" and went as far as to say Trump should be in prison.

""That’s what happens when you break the law, try to steal an election, and incite a deadly insurrection. Donald Trump should be in jail. I’m glad to see the FBI taking steps towards accountability.""

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., called Trump's statement ""defensive"" during an MSNBC segment Monday.

""But look, the FBI doesn't just go in unless a judge signs off on a search warrant. That means they have some probable evidence about possible wrongdoing. And it's something that the whole country needs to pay attention to and shows that Justice Garland, Attorney General Garland is setting this up step by step,"" he stated.

""If the FBI can raid the home of a former US President, imagine what 87,000 more IRS agents will do to you,"" he quipped on Twitter.

On Monday, Aug. 8, 2022, former President Donald J. Trump's home in Florida, Mar-a-Lago, was raided by the FBI.

As reaction continues to come in about this event — What is Mar-a-Lago? Where is it, exactly? How big is it, and how long has he owned it?

Here is some detail and background.

In Donald J. Trump's 2004 book, ""Trump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life,"" he wrote, in part, ""Mar-a-Lago was sitting there a long time before I saw it and decided to move on that magnificent site.""

""I had the right vision for it,"" added Trump, ""and the timing was right for me — and ultimately, for the seller as well.""

Here's more.

When did Trump buy Mar-a-Lago?

Trump bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985 for approximately $10 million, according to publicly available information.

Where is Mar-a-Lago, exactly?

It's located in Palm Beach, Florida. Mar-a-Lago is a resort and national historic landmark.

When was it first built?

It was built between 1924 and 1927.

What is the history of Mar-a-Lago?

""The Mar-a-Lago Estate was opened officially in January 1927 after four years of construction,"" notes the website of Mar-a-Lago itself.

""Marjorie Merriweather Post (then Mrs. E.F. Hutton) searched for several years to find a proper location between the ocean and Lake Worth. The quest for a new home had begun when it became apparent that she was to be the dowager queen of Palm Beach,"" the site also explains.

""The site on which Mar-a-Lago sits is now considered the most valuable parcel of land anywhere in Florida.""

""At the time, there was little else here but undergrowth and swampy grounds, seemingly of not much use for a building site,"" the website notes.

""With her realtor, Post crawled through underbrush of jungle-type growth in search of the perfect piece of property; the consequence of that search is the main house ‘Mar-a-Lago,’ which is Spanish for ‘Sea to Lake.’""

Is Mar-a-Lago hurricane-resistant?

The structure is indeed ""hurricane resistant,"" the website of the mansion states.

How many acres does Mar-a-Lago have?

""The whole of the property comprises approximately 20 acres of perfectly landscaped lawns,"" according to the Mar-a-Lago website.

How valuable is Mar-a-Lago?

""The site on which Mar-a-Lago sits is now considered the most valuable parcel of land anywhere in Florida,"" says the property's website.

When did Mar-a-Lago become a National Historic Site?

""In January 1969, the Department of the Interior designated the estate as ‘the Mar-a-Lago National Historic Site,'"" says the website.

The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 by an Act of Congress.

Later, after Post passed away, ""the estate was willed to the federal government for use as a diplomatic/presidential retreat. Ten years later, due to maintenance and security concerns, the government conferred title to the Post Foundation.""

What other details are known about Trump's purchase of it?

""In 1985, Donald J. Trump purchased the property from the Post Foundation and used the estate as a private residence until 1995.""

Then, in April 1995, ""Mar-a-Lago became established as the Mar-a-Lago Club. It is the last remaining Palm Beach estate still containing its buildings and land in almost identical form as its original conception,"" the website makes clear.

""With the granting of easements to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Mar-a-Lago Club carries with it a built-in constituency that ensures its stewardship into the future.""

What else is there to know about Mar-a-Lago?

Trump keeps a section of the estate private for his family's personal use.

It is the second-largest mansion in the state of Florida.

What is Mar-a-Lago's value?

In 2018, Forbes valued the Mar-a-Lago estate at $160 million — or 16 times what Trump paid for it.

When did Mar-a-Lago become the main residence of Donald and Melania Trump?

In September 2019, Mar-a-Lago became the primary residence for Donald and Melania Trump.

They had previously maintained their primary residence in New York City.

What does membership at Mar-a-Lago include?

Membership includes ""the use of the formal and casual dining areas, the Mar-a-Lago Spa, the pool, the Beach Club, breathtaking guest rooms and exclusive suites, a state-of the-art-fitness center, award-winning tennis courts, beautiful croquet lawns and an entertainment series, which hosts internationally world-renowned talent,"" according to the property's website.

What is the cost of Mar-a-Lago membership?

Reported in multiple places is a figure of approximately $200,000 to join and costs of $14,000 per year, though this is not noted on the Mar-a-Lago website itself.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 – which passed along party lines with Democrats employing the budget reconciliation process – would raise an estimated $739 billion over the next decade, with the revenues going toward initiatives designed to combat climate change and curb pharmaceutical prices, as well as efforts to reduce the nation's $30 trillion debt.

It includes about $433 billion in new spending, while roughly $300 billion of the new revenue raised would go toward paying down the nation's deficit. Democrats say the legislation will help to reduce inflation and provide relief to Americans in the form of lower health care costs, while Republicans argue the measure does little to tackle higher prices – and could actually exacerbate the crisis.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in an analysis last week that the spending bill will have a negligible impact on inflation.

JULY JOBS REPORT 'SCORCHER' RAISES ODDS OF ANOTHER SUPER-SIZED FED RATE HIKE

The bill, which now heads to the House for a vote that could happen as soon as Friday, is a far cry from the ambitious $2 trillion agenda that President Biden rolled out last year that relied on major tax increases on wealthy Americans and corporations.

""This bill is far from perfect. It's a compromise. But it's often how progress is made,"" Biden said at the White House last week. ""My message to Congress is this: This is the strongest bill you can pass.""

Here is a closer look at the tax increases and other items included in the latest legislation:

Corporate minimum tax: $313 billion

The legislation would impose a 15% minimum tax on corporations based on profits they publicly report on their financial statements to shareholders.

The levy would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income. Democrats said the levy would affect around 200 of the country's largest corporations – with profits exceeding $1 billion – that pay less than the current 21% rate for businesses.

The private equity industry secured a last-minute victory when several Democrats voted with Republicans to exempt private equity companies and businesses they own from the new corporate minimum tax.

Prescription drug pricing reforms: $288 billion

Under the bill, the Medicare program would have the power to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies in order to lower prices for certain prescription drugs. The proposal would cap what seniors on Medicare pay out of pocket for drugs each year at $2,000. Seniors would also be eligible for free vaccinations if the bill passes, according to a copy of the legislation.

Democrats projected this will save the government roughly $288 billion over the next 10 years.

If pharmaceutical companies raise the prices of their drugs more than the rate of inflation, pharmaceutical companies would be required to rebate Medicare.

US ECONOMY ENTERS TECHNICAL RECESSION AFTER GROWTH TUMBLES 0.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER

A provision to cap insulin prices at $35 a dose was thrown out by the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan referee, who ruled the limit could be applied to Medicare but not private insurance.

IRS enforcement: $124 billion

The Internal Revenue Service would receive $80 billion in order to enhance tax enforcement by hiring more agents and introducing new technology to pursue tax dodgers.

Democrats expect a beefed-up IRS to add an extra $124 billion in revenue by cracking down on tax evasion by wealthy individuals and corporations.

About $1 trillion in federal taxes may be going unpaid each year because of errors, fraud and a lack of resources to adequately enforce collections, IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said last year.

Audit rates have steadily declined over the last year, falling to the lowest level in at least four decades amid dwindling funding and enforcement staff (the IRS has 20,000 fewer staff than it did in 2010). The agency audited just 0.45% of personal income tax returns in 2019, down from 1.1% in 2010, Rettig said in January.

Stock buyback tax: $74 billion

The measure includes a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases that is poised to take effect in 2023. Democrats – who estimated this new levy will raise about $74 billion over the next decade – are hoping to slow companies' tendency to buy back their own stock from investors.

""These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit scrutiny on small businesses or middle-income Americans,"" Rettig wrote in the letter. ""As we have been planning, our investment of these enforcement resources is designed around Treasury’s directive that audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for households making under $400,000.""

Providing the IRS with an influx of funding has been a top priority for President Biden and is one of the most prominent provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that Senate Democrats passed along party lines early Sunday.

DEMOCRATS' MINIMUM CORPORATE TAX WOULD HIT THESE INDUSTRIES THE HARDEST

The Democrats projected that enhancing IRS funding could add an extra $124 billion in federal revenue over the next decade by hiring more tax enforcers who can limit tax evasion by rich individuals and corporations. Roughly $1 trillion in federal taxes goes unpaid yearly because of errors, fraud and a lack of resources to adequately enforce collections, the IRS estimated last year.

But Republican lawmakers have sounded the alarm over the proposal, warning that it could have serious ramifications for lower-income workers.

That's because the IRS disproportionately targets low-income Americans when it conducts tax audits each year. In fact, households with less than $25,000 in earnings are five times as likely to be audited by the agency than everyone else, according to a recent analysis of tax data from fiscal year 2021 by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University.

The reason for that is a rise in what is known as ""correspondence audits,"" meaning the IRS conducts reviews of tax returns via letters or phone calls rather than more complex face-to-face audits. Just a fraction – 100,000 of the 659,000 audits in 2021 – were conducted in person.

According to the Syracuse study, more than half of the correspondence audits initiated by the IRS last year – 54% – involved low-income workers with gross receipts of less than $25,000 who claimed the earned income tax credit, an anti-poverty measure.

STRATEGISTS, TAX EXPERTS WEIGH IMPLICATIONS OF MANCHIN-BACKED BILL ON MIDTERM ELECTIONS

Even taxpayers with a total positive income that ranged from $200,000 to $1 million had one-third the odds of being audited by the IRS compared to the lowest-income wage earners. About 9 million taxpayers reported these high-income levels in 2021, but fewer than 40,000 of their returns were audited, or roughly 4.5 out of every 1,000. That contrasts sharply with lower-income Americans, who faced an audit rate of 13 out of every 1,000.

The discrepancy is primarily due to high-income taxpayers having complex investments that can easily shroud the gaps between taxes owed and paid vs. taxes reported and paid.

""Barring an unlikely significant change in the composition of IRS enforcement, the stepped-up IRS enforcement would subject taxpayers across the income spectrum to more scrutiny and greater audit risk,"" the conservative Heritage Foundation said in a recent blog post.

Still, Rettig argued that hiring more enforcement officers and modernizing the agency's antiquated technology could actually help the IRS to avoid auditing honest taxpayers.

""Large corporate and high-net-worth taxpayers often engage teams of sophisticated representatives pursuing unsettled or sometimes questionable interpretations of tax law,"" he said.

The EPA bureaucracy is another big winner, with vast new powers.
The healthcare bureaucracy is another big winner, with vast new powers.
You know who's not a big winner in this bill?","The Schumer-Manchin reconciliation bill, falsely titled the "" Inflation Reduction Act ,"" is really a pathetic piece of legislation. It is the ultimate big government socialism bill. It defines the Democratic Party as the radical left. There is no inflation reduction.

There are no incentives for growth or prosperity. It punishes successful people. It intensifies the war against fossil fuels. It adds to the war against the rest of business and industry. It increases the regulatory state that defines ""modern socialism"" and it furthers the Democratic campaign to end free-market capitalism.

There is not one good thing in this bill. The biggest winners are regulatory agencies like the EPA and the IRS, Medicare price controls and special interest rent-seeking corporate handouts. This bill has the potential to increase inflation and deepen recession. It will not reduce deficits or debt. This bill has no common sense. This bill is dumb — very, very dumb.

There's a thousand details that we don't yet know everything about and more will be revealed with our guests tonight, Senator Rob Portman and Ranking Republican Budget leader, Congressman Jason Smith. They'll be on in a moment.

AMID INFLATION, PEOPLE DESPERATE FOR CASH ARE TURNING TO PAWN SHOPS

My biggest concern is the big government socialism aspect of the huge growth in the federal government, and its regulatory octopus tentacles manipulated by left-wing bureaucrats, who in many cases can never be replaced without major governmental reforms.

The IRS is the best example, with an $80 billion budget increase and a doubling of its agents to go out there and chase down Uber drivers, the gig economy, small businesses, waitresses and pretty much anything that moves.

The basic Democratic assumption behind the massive IRS expansion is that successful people are cheating the system. They're all tax cheats. They're evil. They sit around conniving how to not pay taxes; like Elon Musk, who paid $11 billion in personal taxes last year, but presumably the new IRS will descend on him like locusts.

You see, Democrats have come to believe, as Obama said years ago, that ""you didn't build that"" on your own. That our economic system doesn't work without government management through taxing, regulating, spending, borrowing, money-printing. Entrepreneurs don't exist in the Democratic Party model and if they do, they're not paying their fair share and their success must be redistributed, Soviet-style. Let's make everybody equally poor, except of course the wealthy Democratic politicians who milk the system for all it's worth.

Know what the problem with the IRS tax cheat idea is? The tax system designed by Congress is impenetrable and indecipherable. Line up ten tax accountants and none of them will agree on crucial tax provisions. That's the problem. It's not tax cheats. It's terrible government tax policy.

A nice simplified low flat tax rate system would eliminate the need for 150,000 IRS agents and what's incredible on this topic is that, once again, the Congress in this session has significantly increased the number of tax credits, refundable credits, deductions, carve-outs, all sorts of political favors and corporate welfare, which will make the tax code immensely more complex and indecipherable.

In other words, ""there they go again"" and once this revenue grab fails, maybe the next Congress will ask for another 80,000 IRS agents.

FED COULD APPROVE 100-BASIS POINT INTEREST RATE HIKE AFTER JOBS SHOCKER, CITI SAYS

The whole IRS story epitomizes what is wrong with the DC swamp, and Congress, and the Executive Branch, and the massive regulatory state that is to be foisted on ordinary Americans.

The EPA bureaucracy is another big winner, with vast new powers. The healthcare bureaucracy is another big winner, with vast new powers.

You know who's not a big winner in this bill? Smart young men and women who come up with brilliant new ideas that turn into massive new advanced technologies, inventions or innovations. Their entrepreneurship will be punished — not rewarded — by taxes or rules and regulations or inflation .

The minimum book tax would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income.
The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.","The sweeping climate, health care and tax bill that Senate Democrats passed Sunday includes one of the biggest tax hikes in decades, including a new levy for corporations that repurchase their own stock.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which passed along party lines with Democrats employing the budget reconciliation process, would raise an estimated $739 billion over the next decade, with the revenues going toward initiatives designed to combat climate change and curb pharmaceutical prices, as well as efforts to reduce the nation's $30 trillion debt.

It includes about $433 billion in new spending, while roughly $300 billion of the new revenue raised would go toward paying down the nation's deficit.

Some of the main revenue raisers stem from new levies on wealthy businesses, including a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases that is poised to take effect in 2023. Democrats, who estimated this new levy will raise about $74 billion over the next decade, are hoping to slow companies' tendency to buy back their own stock from investors with the tax.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT: WHAT TAX HIKES ARE IN THE BILL?

Companies have been allowed to buy their own shares since 1982, and the practice has since become commonplace on Wall Street. In 2019, stock buybacks hit a record $1 trillion, according to the SEC. Buybacks already hit a record $281 billion in the first three months of 2022, according to S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt. Although they were down 17.4% in the second quarter.

""I hate stock buybacks,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""I think they are one of the most self-serving things that corporate America does.""

The bill also imposes a 15% minimum tax on corporations based on profits they publicly report on their financial statements to shareholders. The minimum book tax would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income. Democrats said the levy would affect around 200 of the country's largest corporations with profits exceeding $1 billion and that pay less than the current 21% rate for businesses.

Experts expect the two taxes to drag on 2023 earnings, with Goldman Sachs forecasting a 1.5% decline per share of S&P 500 companies. The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.

UBS strategists led by Solita Marcelli, meanwhile, projected the new taxes would have a ""very minimal 1% drag on S&P 500 earnings per share, although some companies will be more affected than others.""

He also noted that the inflationary pressures have led to soaring demand at food banks.

""We’re worried,"" Flood told ""Varney & Co."" on Tuesday.

""We rely mostly on donated food from farmers, retailers, manufacturers and then we supplement that with food purchases and so being a nonprofit, it’s a matter of what resources are coming in, in terms of the amount of food, the amount of funding to supplement that food, so it’s a concern right now as we look between now and the end of the year, especially because of inflation.""

FOOD BANKS ARE SERVING MORE PEOPLE AGAIN AS INFLATION SQUEEZES BUDGETS

""It’s really put a lot of pressure on families and household budgets and it’s leading a lot of people needing to seek food assistance,"" he stressed.

Flood provided the insight the day before July’s inflation data will be released.

Last month, the Labor Department revealed that inflation accelerated more than expected to a new four-decade high in June, exacerbating a financial strain for millions of Americans.

The department said the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 9.1% in June from a year ago. Prices jumped 1.3% in the one-month period from May. Those figures were both far higher than the 8.8% headline figure and 1% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists.

The data marked the fastest pace of inflation since December 1981.

Price increases were extensive with energy prices rising 7.5% in June from the previous month and 41.6% compared to the same time last year. Gasoline, on average, costs 59.9% more than it did one year ago and 11.2% more than it did in May. The food index, meanwhile, climbed 1% in June, as consumers paid more for items like cereal, chicken, milk, and fresh vegetables.

Shelter costs – which account for roughly one-third of the CPI – sped up again in June, climbing 0.6%, matching an 18-year-high set in May. On an annual basis, shelter costs have climbed 5.6%, the fastest since February 1991.

Rent costs also surged in June, jumping 0.8% over the month, the largest monthly increase since April 1986. Rising rents are a concerning development because higher housing costs most directly and acutely affect household budgets.

Flood pointed out the shift in the trend he has been noticing as it pertains to the demographic visiting food banks.

He noted that during the pandemic ""we had so many people who were furloughed or lost their jobs and didn’t have employment.""

""Now the employment picture has improved when you compare it to 2020 and 2021, so now we’re seeing a lot of people who are working, sometimes two jobs, in the family or household, sometimes more,"" Flood said.

He stressed that even so, ""the high prices of food, of fuel, and housing in a place like Los Angeles and other metro areas puts a lot of pressure on budgets.""

With inflation at 40-year highs, many Americans are looking for aid for the first time and food banks are struggling to meet demand.

Charitable food distribution has exceeded any amounts given out before the COVID-19 pandemic, although there was some relief last year.

Distribution by California's Alameda County Community Food Bank has risen this summer and Texas' Houston Food Bank now gives out an average of 610,000 pounds.

In Southern California, the Los Angeles bank gave away around 30 million pounds of food during the first three months of this year, far more than the 22 million pounds passed out during the first quarter of 2020.

A spokesperson said that was up from 500,000 daily pounds before the pandemic.

""Freeport does create an impact in the quarter and we've provided for that for the year,"" Auchincloss said. The company had deducted the expected costs from its second-quarter profit, but Auchincloss did not specify costs.

A BP spokesperson declined to comment on the loss figure.

France's TotalEnergies also said it would replace eight cargoes of LNG it was scheduled to receive from Freeport by buying in the spot market in the third quarter of the year. It was unclear how much the replacement cargoes would cost TotalEnergies.

Freeport produces 15 million tonnes of LNG per year.

Traders typically sign long-term offtake agreements with LNG producers and agree on separate deals to supply consumers with cargoes from their global portfolios. It's rare to use plant outages to justify not supplying consumers through what is known as force majeure.

Shell , the world's largest LNG trader with a 20% market share, cut its LNG production volumes in the second quarter by 4%, mainly due to supply losses from the Sakhalin-2 plant in Russia, where it exited operations after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February.

The company continues to receive LNG cargoes under existing long-term deals with Sakhalin-2, a company spokesperson said.

But the future of the contracts is shrouded in uncertainty after Russia gave foreign investors in the project one month to claim their stakes in a new entity that will replace the existing one. Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said it was ""highly unlikely"" Shell would join the new entity.

The supply loss impacted Shell's second-quarter profit by around $200 million in the quarter, according to estimates by industry sources. Shell declined to comment on the figure.

CRUDE OIL PRICES RISE AS RUSSIA SUSPENDS EXPORTS TO EUROPE THROUGH PIPELINE

On top of that, Shell and its partners lost LNG production at the giant Prelude floating LNG off the western coast of Australia after shutting it down amid a pay dispute.

Nigeria's huge LNG export terminal on Bonny Island has also seen output declines in recent months as a result of a shortfall in natural gas supplies due to rampant theft and sabotage to oil and gas pipelines.

The money lost is dwarfed by enormous profits both BP and Shell recorded this year on the back of soaring refining margins and high oil and gas prices.

But lower availability of LNG has pushed benchmark prices to record highs as Europe sought to ramp up imports rapidly to replace lost Russian pipeline natural gas.

At current prices, an average cargo of LNG would cost around $100 million in the spot market.

European LNG imports from January to July surpassed a record 100 billion cubic metres (bcm), or 75 million tonnes (Mt), almost reaching the level observed through the entire 2021, according to Nnenna Amobi, senior LNG analyst at Refinitiv.

Around 35% of total European imports were received from the United States in July, versus 43% in June, mainly due to the loss of Freeport cargoes.

The global LNG market reached 380 million tonnes in 2021, according to Shell."

Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

As a parent, you have two main options to help pay for your child’s college expenses: Parent PLUS Loans and private student loans .

The federal government offers Parent PLUS Loans and they come with unique benefits. Private loans come from private lenders, and they may have lower interest rates if you have good credit.

In this article, we’ll go over the main differences between the two types of loans to help you figure out which may be right for you.



Credible lets you compare private student loan rates from multiple lenders, all in one place.

Parent PLUS Loans vs. private parent loans

Both Parent PLUS Loans and private parent loans give you the opportunity to borrow money for your child’s higher education expenses. But they differ significantly in how interest rates are set and how you’ll repay them.

Parent PLUS Loans

The U.S. Department of Education offers Parent PLUS Loans, which are more formally known as Direct PLUS Loans. Graduate or professional students can take these loans out, as well as parents of undergraduate students.

You generally apply for these loans online through the StudentAid.gov website . In most cases, you won’t qualify if you have an adverse credit history, like a bankruptcy or foreclosure in the last five years or a history of late or missed payments.

Parent PLUS Loans have a fixed interest rate set by the federal government, which is currently 7.54%. That means the interest rate won’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You’re able to borrow up to the full cost of attendance, as determined by your child’s school, minus any other financial aid the student receives. When you take out the loan, you’ll also pay a fee of 4.228% of the loan amount. To pay the fee, the government will deduct a portion of the funds from each loan payout.

Private parent loans

Private parent student loans have no standard requirements. Instead, individual lenders set their own qualifications, interest rates, and repayment terms. But in general, lenders determine the interest rate based on your credit score. People with higher credit scores will qualify for lower rates, while people with poor credit will get higher rates, if they qualify.

You may find private parent loans with fixed or variable rates. Variable-rate loans typically begin with a lower APR, but this rate can rise over time. Fixed-rate loans don’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You usually have the option to make full principal and interest payments while your child is in school, or you can make interest-only payments to keep the interest from building up. Most private parent loans must be repaid within 15 years, though loan terms may be shorter depending on the lender.

The best private parent loans feature zero loan fees. Just like with Parent PLUS Loans, you’re solely responsible for repaying a private parent loan.

Cosigned student loans

A third option for helping your child pay for their college education is by cosigning their student loan. When you do this, your child is the primary borrower on the loan but you’re agreeing to be responsible for repaying the loan if your child defaults.

You may consider cosigning a private student loan with your child. In many cases, students aren’t able to qualify for a loan on their own since they may have little or no credit history. By cosigning, lenders take your credit into account as well. Any missed payments will hurt both your credit and your child’s. Many lenders offer a cosigner release option, which allows you to remove yourself from the loan once your child has made a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments.

A cosigner usually isn’t required on federal student loans.

When does it make sense to take out a Parent PLUS Loan?

A Parent PLUS Loan may make the most sense if you have fair credit. With these federal loans, the interest rate is the same no matter your credit score. If you don’t have any major credit problems, but your score simply isn’t the best, you may get a lower rate on a Parent PLUS Loan than you would on a private loan.

A Parent PLUS Loan may also be the best choice if you want to take advantage of one of the unique repayment plans the government offers:

Standard Repayment Plan — This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years.

This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years. Extended Repayment Plan — This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan.

This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan. Graduated Repayment Plan — This plan can help if you expect to have a higher income in the future. Your payments start low, but rise over time. Ideally, your income would grow along with your payment. You also have up to 10 years to repay your loan under this plan.

If your payments are still too high, you may have the option to combine all the Parent PLUS Loans you have into a federal Direct Consolidation Loan, which gives you the option of enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. With these plans, your monthly payment is capped at a certain percentage of your discretionary income. This can be a great option if your discretionary income is relatively low.

When does it make sense to take out a private parent student loan?

If your child has exhausted all their scholarship, grant, and federal loan options, and if you have excellent credit, a private parent student loan may make the most sense. You’ll likely be able to qualify for a lower rate than what you’d receive with a Parent PLUS Loan, saving you money in interest.

Private loans may also make sense if you’d like to choose a variable interest rate. This option gives you a lower initial rate, though it can rise over time. If you expect to pay off the loan quickly, though, you may be able to keep the lower interest rate and pay off the loan before it rises."

Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity would decline at a 4.7% rate in the April-June period.

Large shifts in the composition of the U.S. workforce in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have made it harder to measure underlying productivity growth, which some economists put at about 1.0% or less, making the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation more difficult.

The firm’s termination of its tech-enabled home-flipping business, known as ""iBuying,"" follows Zillow’s announcement about two weeks ago that it was halting all new home purchases for the rest of the year. At the time, Zillow pointed to labor and supply shortages for its inability to renovate and flip houses fast enough.

In a statement Tuesday, Chief Executive Rich Barton said Zillow had failed to predict the pace of home-price appreciation accurately, marking an end to a venture the company once said could generate $20 billion a year. Instead, the company said it now plans to cut 25% of its workforce.

ZILLOW STOCK DROPS AS COMPANY PUTS HOMEBUYING ON HOLD

""We’ve determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated and continuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility,"" Barton said.

Zillow and other tech-powered house flippers, known as iBuyers, purchase homes, renovate them and then try to sell them quickly, making money on transaction fees and home-price appreciation. Zillow used an algorithm to make home price estimates, called the ""Zestimate,"" and determine what it would pay home sellers.

Ultralow mortgage-interest rates and a need for more space to work from home have driven robust home-buying demand in the past year and a half. Prices have climbed sharply in almost every corner of the U.S.

""It feels like this would be a hard time to lose money buying and selling houses,"" said Benjamin Keys, professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ""This is a time frame where prices have gone up in a lot of places, dramatically.""

In recent months, sky-high prices have forced out some buyers, and the market has showed signs of cooling off, as many economists expected. The median existing-home sales price rose 13.3% in September from a year earlier—still unusually robust, though down from 23.6% year-over-year price growth in May, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Even this gradual tapering in price growth flummoxed Zillow’s algorithm, leading the company to pull the plug on the venture.

ZILLOW RIDES BOOMING REAL ESTATE MARKET TO 70% REVENUE GROWTH

Zillow’s class C share price was down 10% on Tuesday, falling before the company announced after the market closed that it would end home flipping. Shares continued to slide in after-hours trading.

The move represents a big hit to Zillow’s top line. Home-flipping was the company’s largest source of revenue, but it has never turned a profit.

Zillow, which released earnings Tuesday, said its home-flipping business, Zillow Offers, lost $381 million last quarter, as measured by adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That resulted in a combined adjusted Ebitda loss of $169 million across all of Zillow.

Zillow has an inventory of about 9,800 homes across the United States that it is currently shopping to investors. Additionally, there are another 8,200 homes in contract it has agreed to buy. The company expects to lose somewhere between 5% and 7% on these homes, the company said.

Starting in the summer, competitors such as OpenDoor and Offerpad began to pull back from home purchases in one of the biggest home-flipping markets, Phoenix, as the red-hot pandemic market began to cool.

But Zillow accelerated, according to an analysis of sales records by real-estate tech researcher Mike DelPrete, scholar-in-residence at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Zillow also paid significantly more than those competitors for each home it purchased, buying homes priced $65,000 above the median on average, according to DelPrete’s analysis.

By October, the company had listed 250 Phoenix homes at a median-price discount of 6.2% below what it had paid for them. DelPrete called Zillow’s price blunder a catastrophic failure.

A wider look at Zillow’s national performance by analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets found it had listed 66% of homes at prices below what it had paid for them, with an average discount of 4.5%.

""The fact that Zillow can’t make it work shouldn’t be the final death knell for iBuying,"" DelPrete said. ""The other companies are making improvements, and Zillow’s not. They’re still losing lots of money.""

Zillow said it expects that the wind-down of its home-flipping outfit will take several quarters."

It was previously owned by a trust connected to Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub, records show. Mr. Azria and his wife, Florence Azria, bought it for $41 million in 2013, records show.

Mr. Azria said it took him four years to completely renovate the property. ""I’m proud someone wants to pay this kind of price for something I created,"" he said, declining to name the buyer.

The main house is roughly 10,000 square feet, he said, and the property has a cinema, a spa and two guesthouses.

Mr. Azria said he decided to sell because he is working on another project: a circa 1927 Spanish-style house in Bel-Air. ""I’m the kind of person who likes to move on and do something different,"" he said.

FOX Business has learned that Bakish once again won’t be attending the investment bank’s annual ""summer camp for billionaires"" in Sun Valley, Idaho where the rich and famous in the world of the media and finance think big thoughts and at times lay the groundwork for potential big deals.

The event officially begins Tuesday, but the top media executives began flying into the tiny hamlet 155 miles east of Boise on Monday. The resort area will for a week house more billionaires than possibly anywhere in the country. This year’s event will feature some controversial figures in media and tech such as former Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos who just days ago stepped down from e-commerce giant Amazon amid intense regulatory pressure.

'GREASE,' 'GODFATHER' TO RETURN ON PARAMOUNT+ AS VIACOMCBS MOUNTS STREAMING CHALLENGE

The Bakish-Allen & Co. contretemps stem back to 2017 when Bakish butted heads with bankers at the firm over Viacom’s planned acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive. Bakish was CEO of the then standalone Viacom. Discovery ultimately won the bidding war for the $12 billion takeover, but Bakish complained to his board about Allen’s work on the deal and banished them from further assignments. Since then Bakish hasn’t attended the high-profile conference. His last appearance came in 2017.

This year's apparent snub is more glaring given Bakish’s clout in the media business. In 2019 Bakish was named head of the combined ViacomCBS that is controlled by the Redstone family’s parent company National Amusements, thus making him one of the most powerful executives in media.

Bakish’s standing, particularly among investment bankers, could grow even more if, as rumored, he shops ViacomCBS to suitors. Such a possibility makes his absence all the more conspicuous.

A spokesman for ViacomCBS had no comment and a spokesperson from Allen & Co. could not be reached.

The 2021 event comes after a one-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As in past years, tech, media, and finance royalty are on the attendee list such as Bakish’s boss, Shari Redstone, president of National Amusements.

Investment bankers say Redstone will be shopping for deals at the conference including a possible Comcast merger, which would face significant antitrust hurdles since such a deal would have the companies combining rival broadcast networks CBS and NBC, the latter of which is owned by Comcast. Currently Federal Communications Commission rules ""prohibit a merger between any two of the big four broadcast television networks.""

One former mainstay attendee who will not be part of the festivities is former CBS chief Les Moonves who was ousted from the company in 2018 amid sexual harassment allegations. Redstone butted heads with Moonves who resisted her plan to merge both Viacom and CBS, which had been separate units controlled by Redstone’s late father, Sumner Redstone who passed away in August 2020.

When Shari Redstone combined the two companies, she appointed Bakish CEO of ViacomCBS which now controls some of the most well-known brands in media such as Paramount Pictures, CBS News, Comedy Central and MTV.

WINNERS & LOSERS IN DISCOVERY'S MARRIAGE WITH AT&T'S WARNERMEDIA

Other attendees of the event will be David Zaslav, newly anointed CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery which recently spun out of AT&T in one of the most high-profile tie-ups of the year. Bezos, who relinquished his position as Amazon CEO on Monday to Andy Jassy. Both are expected to attend while they face serious pressures from regulators in the Biden administration who want to break up the company on the grounds that it’s a monopoly.

Amazon has been on the deal-making hunt as well recently with its acquisition of MGM Studios for $8.5 billion. Meanwhile, investors have been speculating that Amazon will split its stock when Bezos steps down to get retail investors interested in its shares which closed Friday at a whopping $3,510.

The e-commerce giant's stock has been pretty stagnant over the past year, only posting 8% returns year-to-date. Investors believe a stock split will help drive the stock price higher.

Aside from Bezos, other big names in attendance include Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Netflix’s Reed Hastings, Comcast’s Brian Roberts and WarnerMedia’s Chief Executive, Jason Kilar. Bill Gates is also said to be on the list following a tumultuous year for the Microsoft founder including a divorce and rumored ties with the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein.

Gates also stepped down from Microsoft’s board in March of 2020 amid an investigation that he had an affair years ago with a Microsoft employee. A spokesperson for Gates said the decision to step down from the board was unrelated to the affair, which ended amicably.

Deal talk already circulating at Sun Valley ranges from mega-media deals to smaller streaming takeovers. Aside from finding a possible suitor for ViacomCBS, Lionsgate, the independent movie and TV studio, has long been said to be an acquisition target. John Feltheimer, CEO of Lionsgate, will be one of the big names in attendance. Also reportedly being shopped around is NFL Network and possible suitors could include Fox Corp, the parent company of FOX Business Network, bankers say.

Another big theme investors are watching is the rise in popularity of the video gaming space. Since the start of the pandemic, the video gaming industry has exploded, now worth more than $180 billion. Heads of gaming companies like Activision Blizzard Entertainment and Epic Games are expected to be in attendance, possibly looking to strike up deals of their own."

The dispute involves around 5,000 parking spaces the city and bondholders agreed to give the Yankees as part of the development project – a complex, multi-year effort to bring economic growth to the poor South Bronx neighborhood Yankee Stadium calls home.

The development included a new stadium for New York City’s professional soccer team, New York City F.C., a hotel and retail stores on grounds that currently house parking lots and garages for Yankee games that the city is mandated to provide under a 2007 agreement with the team. It would be financed with private money arranged by a consortium that includes a housing developer and the owners of the soccer team.

BITCOIN, CRYPTO IN MLB NO LONGER OUT OF LEFT FIELD

Bonds issued in 2007 to build the parking facilities have fallen into default in recent years, while the parking garages owe the city millions of dollars in back taxes. The consortium also agreed to pay $50 million to restructure the defaulted debt.

For years, city officials and bondholders have said they were eager to find a solution to the Yankee parking imbroglio and until last week, all indications were that they had one.

But Yankee officials say the city and bondholders have reneged on a key piece of the deal that has put the entire project on hold indefinitely and possibly forever. That deal involved a guarantee of first-class parking for its fans even as the team agreed to reduce the city’s initial 9,000 plus parking space commitment.

A term sheet providing details of the agreement between bondholders, the city’s Economic Development Corporation (EDC) and the Yankees were reviewed by FOX Business.

""I’m very disappointed,"" said Yankee President Randy Levine, a former prosecutor and top city official under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani who was the architect of the redevelopment proposal. ""This would have gone a long way to salvaging the bonds plus we were going to spend a billion dollars in private money to revitalize this area that would produce thousands of good paying jobs.""

Levine added: ""The deal broke down over the bondholders and the city refusing to do what they agreed to do in the bond offerings and in the terms sheets.""

A spokeswoman for New York City's EDC said it was the Yankees who were backing out of promises made to get the deal done. She would not elaborate.

In a statement, EDC President Rachel Loeb said, ""After years of negotiations with the New York Yankees and other parties, we are disappointed they will not commit to promises already made to the city and the community and attempted to change key terms of the deal only days before a community board vote.""

A spokeswoman for Nuveen told Fox Business: ""Nuveen remains committed to the transaction set forth in the term sheet and looks forward to a continued strong relationship with the Yankees and the City.""

MLB OPENING DAY: GEORGE STEINBRENNER IV TALKS YANKEES BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS AMID COVID

The blowup of the agreement could have significant political repercussions for the next mayor of New York City, who will need to make economic redevelopment a top priority following the COVID-19 pandemic that saw businesses close amid strict city-wide lockdowns.

Bill de Blasio, the current mayor, is leaving office next year under mandated term limits. It’s expected that the winner of the recent Democratic primary either Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams or former New York City Sanitation Commissioner Kathyrn Garcia, will become the next mayor in the heavily Democratic city. Both are locked in a tight race and votes are still being counted.

The controversy surrounding parking for the Yankees has been a long-running problem that began with the construction of the new Yankee Stadium in 2006. Under a deal with the city, the Yankees are guaranteed 9,127 spaces by a non-profit that runs the garages, Bronx Parking Development Corp., documents show. Starting in 2007, the company issued more than $200 million in debt to construct garages and make other renovations to maintain ""first-class"" parking facilities for Yankee fans.

But the garages have fallen into disrepair and are anything but first-class these days. Many fans now take nearby suburban trains and city subways to travel to Yankee Stadium. The parking bonds have been in default for years and trade at distressed levels.

Management of the Yankees led by Levine, came up with a possible solution in 2018. Since the Yankees are part owners of NYCFC – a franchise with Major League Soccer – with the Abu Dhabi royal family, Levine cobbled together a proposal to finance the soccer stadium with private money on spaces now occupied by the Yankees parking. To get community buy-in, the Yankees teamed up with a developer to provide low-income housing, a new school and other amenities to the neighborhood.

The Yankees agreed to give up their rights to 9,127 spaces for something closer to 5,611 as long as the parking lot was maintained, the document shows. Bondholders' debt would be restructured as part of a new company.

Nuveen, which holds most of the bonds, would be the primary beneficiary of the $50 million payment.

The $1 billion project was expected to create thousands of jobs for a neighborhood that routinely ranks as among the nation’s poorest. All parties signed off on the term sheet which described the city’s and the bondholder's commitments to provide the roughly 5,000 parking spaces for the Yankees. The neighborhood’s community board was expected to vote on the measure this month.

But the Yankees say last week the deal was upended when the city’s EDC – the lead city agency handling the deal – and Nuveen balked at a parking space guarantee even at the reduced numbers that the Yankees wanted in the official contracts of the redevelopment.

Both are said to fear that such specific guarantees could open the entities to future litigation and that specific ""third-party beneficiary rights"" were never part of any deal. Yankees officials counter that all they were doing was codifying guarantees in the earlier agreement, and in the term sheet, albeit at a lower number of spaces.

City Economic Development officials tell FOX Business that they are still hopeful a deal can be worked out that satisfies both parties and that the community board can vote on the project sometime in the Fall.

But according to Levine, it appears the two sides are deadlocked over the semantics of what the city and the bondholders consider a guarantee. ""I tried to explain to them that the company emerging out of bankruptcy should guarantee these spots because that’s what the bond issuance was for—providing parking for Yankee Stadium and the community,"" Levine said. ""It made no sense to us why the city and the bondholders didn’t want to guarantee these spots. They just don’t want to guarantee what they agreed to in the past and that's provide Yankee fans and the community with parking."""

And the answer they’re getting is a resounding ""yes.""

FOX Business has learned that top c-suite officials from the big banks have been setting up meetings with the relatively new chairman of the SEC in recent weeks to get a better idea of his agenda as head of Wall Street’s top cop.

Gensler was nominated by Democratic President Biden for the post and was confirmed by the Senate in April. People who have met with him say he hasn't yet fully moved into his office at the commission's Washington, DC headquarters. They say he is still largely working from his home in nearby Baltimore.

FEDS ACCELERATING CRYPTO WORLD CRACKDOWN

From his home office, however, Gensler is plotting to be a ""transformational"" SEC chair, according to Wall Street executives who know him. His top priority, he has signaled to these people: significant changes in what corporations must disclose to the public that reflect certain political, environmental and social goals an increasing number of investors are demanding.

Gensler is also telling executives that he will not ignore the traditional parts of his job and will be looking to enhance protections for small investors who have flooded the market in recent years, embracing risky financial products on a scale not seen since the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.

""He's worried about small investors getting ripped off, but the highest priority will be the new disclosure rules that appeal to the environment and issues like that,"" said one c-suite executive who asked not to be named.

An SEC spokesman had no comment.

Gensler, well-known and mostly well regarded among the Wall Street elite given his long years as a banker at the prestigious investment house Goldman Sachs and later while serving in various government finance-related roles including chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under former President Obama.

SEC PICKS AS CORPORATE REGULATOR A PROFESSOR WHO CRITICIZED STARTUP ‘UNICORNS’

His politics have transformed over the years from a left-of-center liberal on financial issues to someone who now embraces progressive edicts from the likes of Democratic Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fierce critic of corporate America. Wall Street executives say Gensler is so close to Warren he often confers with her on policy issues. A spokesman for Warren didn't return a call for comment.

Gensler's political beliefs are said to be at the center of his new – and according to some observers radical agenda – as SEC chair. He wants to impose new disclosure rules sometime before the end of the year that will force companies to go beyond alerting investors about financial issues that can materially impact their holdings. That will mean corporations will have to disclose issues about their carbon footprint, board-room diversity and other non-financial issues. It's unclear what exactly Gensler will be asking in terms of these new disclosures, but Wall Street executives say he is telling people he and his staff will provide details by the fall.

The disclosures will certainly draw criticism from some corporate executives and GOP politicians who believe Gensler is overstepping his role as a regulator of markets by embracing progressive political issues.

But Gensler appears undeterred. ""He is really serious about this stuff that probably comes right from Elizabeth Warren’s office,"" said one attorney who deals with major corporations on their dealings with the SEC. The attorney said Gensler will pass the rules through a party-line vote since Democrats outnumber Republican commissioners 3-to-2.

Other issues Gensler will focus on are those he believes involve more typical Wall Street abuse of small investors. He's said to be worried that there's not enough disclosure when retail investors buy shares of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies or SPACs. This is a new way a company can go public by being acquired by a shell company that buys several different ventures. Gensler is worried that small investors who buy shares at initial public offering are getting crushed with fees that aren't levied on big investors who sponsored the product.

SEC MULLS GAMESTOP, AMC ‘GAMIFICATION’ CRACKDOWN WITH REGULATORY LAYER

One particular concern in the SPAC space for Gensler is the so-called celebrity SPAC where movie stars and professional athletes lend their names to the SPAC even though they have no investment expertise, these people add.

Also on his list, as previously reported by FOX Business, the issues of payment for order flow and the gamification of trading. Payment for order flow is the system that allows small investors to trade for free or at a low cost through discount brokerages. Brokers sell their order flow, or buy and sell orders, to other financial firms to match the orders. The financial firms make money on the bid-and-ask spread and by handling so many trades even fractions of a penny could add up to enormous profits.

The SEC chairman is worried the system gives financial firms matching the orders--like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial--an unfair information advantage in the markets. One option he has discussed: Forcing discount brokers to send more of their trades to public exchanges where there is more transparency.

Gensler appears to be still grappling with how to regulate the so-called gamification of trading, where discount brokers appear to lure unsophisticated investors to their platform through gimmicks and incentives without properly disclosing the risks involved in trading. Wall Street executives say clues to how Gensler will regulate gamification might be found in the upcoming IPO documents for trading app Robinhood, which has been in negotiations with the SEC about becoming a public company via its private filing.

Robinhood, which offers trading with no fees, is planning to come public later this summer; its IPO document known as an S-1 will be publicly released imminently."

FOX Business has discussed the costs with Wall Street executives, analysts and think tank leaders, and while no exact estimate can be determined, the SEC’s new disclosure mandates involving everything from the environment to board diversity is likely to cost U.S. public companies well into the billions of dollars.

Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, known for his progressive leanings, has put at the top of the commission’s voting agenda new rules that will mandate disclosing information on so-called ESG or Environmental, Social, Governance issues. These issues involve a public company's commitment to alleviate climate change and other non-financial disclosures.

SEC PICKS AS CORPORATE REGULATOR A PROFESSOR WHO CRITICIZED STARTUP ‘UNICORNS’

Gensler met with President Biden and other top financial regulators on Monday to discuss climate-related financial risks and how regulators can push the president’s green and social agenda through edicts aimed at public companies. Gensler has said such disclosures are being demanded by a new breed of investor looking to make corporate America more socially responsible.

But critics such as business groups, and GOP lawmakers say the move by the SEC is part of a broader effort by the Biden administration to force companies to embrace a progressive social agenda. They also contend the commission is exceeding its authority that has traditionally focused on protecting small investors from financial fraud.

Gensler is forging ahead, however, and given the political makeup of the commission with Democrats outnumbering GOP commissioners by a 3-to-2 majority, he is likely to push through his new disclosure mandates possibly by the end of the year, say people with knowledge of the chairman’s thinking.

According to the proposed new disclosure standards, companies must ""ramp up disclosures regarding their climate change-related risks,"" and ""enhance (company) disclosures about the diversity of board members and nominees.""

SEC MULLS GAMESTOP, AMC ‘GAMIFICATION’ CRACKDOWN WITH REGULATORY LAYER

While there is a contentious debate about the need for such disclosures, one thing is certain: Companies will be spending significant sums of money on both lawyers and consultants on how best to disclose a corporation’s carbon footprint and the new diversity mandates.

For example, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, estimates that the new corporate disclosure rules will cost ""billions of dollars"", and possibly leading to lower shareholder returns. The group also warns of massive legal liabilities as progressive activists challenge the veracity of the corporate disclosures since the SEC rule, at least in its current proposed form, is amorphous and thus leaves room for various interpretations.

""It’s not a one size fits all approach"", says Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors. ""ESG reporting is so vague, there’s really no way to quantify it.""

An SEC spokesman declined to comment, but the woke disclosure rules have their support in certain areas of the financial business that has focused on ESG investing. Blackrock, the world’s largest money manager, is offering a slew of new ESG funds that screen for companies that meet ESG standards but also charge investors higher fees than other funds offered by the company.

Blackrock’s CEO, Larry Fink, has been an advocate of social investing and using Blackrock’s clout (it manages nearly $9 trillion) to push for these reforms at the companies it invests in. The firm recently voted to place on the board of oil giant ExxonMobil three activist shareholders from the ESG-centric fund, Engine No 1.

""I think spending billions (on these disclosures) is exaggerated,"" said Columbia law professor John Coffee, an expert in corporate governance matters. ""And as Engine No. 1 proved with Exxon, shareholders appear willing to vote for such goals.""

Some Wall Street analysts say the size of the costs for these disclosures could easily run into the billions of dollars as they spend money on consultants to prepare for the additional disclosure, plus in the case of banks, they may also be barred from doing business with companies that are deemed fully committed to the woke policies.

""Mandated disclosures could impact (banks) bottom line because they might be forced not to lend to companies and businesses that don't meet the ESG standards,"" said Dick Bove, an analyst at Odeon Capital.

Also, the costs will fall disproportionately on smaller public companies that don’t have the same cash on hand and the staff to deal with the new legal issues.

""This whole ESG thing is just one giant waste of time and money,"" added Whalen Global Advisors chief, Chris Whalen, ""It’s just a big show that only benefits the consultants and the lawyers who are making money off of this."""

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT IS ‘DECEPTIVE MARKETING’, WILL HURT STRUGGLING AMERICANS, ECONOMIST SAYS

The department said the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 9.1% in June from a year ago. Prices jumped 1.3% in the one-month period from May. Those figures were both far higher than the 8.8% headline figure and 1% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists.

The data marked the fastest pace of inflation since December 1981.

Price increases were extensive with energy prices rising 7.5% in June from the previous month and up 41.6% from last year. Gasoline, on average, costs 59.9% more than it did one year ago and 11.2% more than it did in May. The food index, meanwhile, climbed 1% in June, as consumers paid more for items like cereal, chicken, milk and fresh vegetables.

Summer staples, including hotdogs, have been costing more as well. Hot dogs increased by more than 16% compared to the same time last year and ice cream rose more than 12%.

Why you should avoid them: Cash advance loans are still significantly more expensive than traditional personal loans, or even credit cards.

Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

Getting a personal loan can be difficult if you have a limited credit history or bad credit. Some lenders that target bad credit borrowers promise no credit check and fast funding. But these loans often come with expensive fees that can trap you in a cycle of debt.

If you’re struggling to choose the right personal loan — or finding it flat-out impossible — you may start to feel discouraged. Before you settle for an expensive loan product, though, here are some bad credit loans that you should avoid — whether you just need a few hundred dollars, want a $10,000 loan , or anything in between.



Credible makes it easy to see your prequalified personal loan rates from various lenders, all in one place.

1. Payday loans

A payday loan is a small, short-term loan intended to tide you over with an advance until your next payday. Storefront payday lenders typically offer these loans, but you may also find them online. Depending on your state, there may also be a maximum borrowing limit, often $500 or less. Lenders usually require borrowers to repay these loans in two to four weeks’ time, in one lump sum, plus fees.

If you’re struggling to make ends meet before your paycheck hits, this can seem like an enticing loan option, especially if you need same-day funds .

Why you should avoid them: Most payday loan lenders don’t have strict credit- or income-based qualifications, so they often loan money to people who may struggle to repay the debt . Additionally, these loans are notoriously expensive. While most states cap the interest that can be charged per $100 borrowed, this is usually in the range of $10 to $30.

While that may not sound like too much, when you consider the length of the loan term and the low borrowing limits, these fees work out to an astronomical APR. For example, a $100 payday loan with a two-week repayment term and a $15 fee equates to an APR of nearly 400%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

Compare that to the average interest rate on a 24-month personal loan — 8.73% in May 2022, according to the Federal Reserve — and it’s easy to see what a ""deal"" payday loans really work out to be.

2. Cash advance loans

A cash advance loan is similar to a payday loan, in that you can use its short-term funds to help you cover immediate or unexpected expenses. These loans can even be funded as quickly as the same day, depending on the lender.

Cash advance loans differ from payday loans in some important ways, though. For starters, you can usually borrow a lot more with a cash advance loan, with some lenders offering as much as $5,000. You don’t always have to repay a cash advance loan in just a few weeks, either; you may be able to take out a cash advance that you can repay in monthly installments.

Why you should avoid them: Cash advance loans are still significantly more expensive than traditional personal loans, or even credit cards. Depending on the lender, your cash advance loan could have an APR of 299% or more.

3. Car title loans

If you have bad credit and need to borrow money, using your vehicle as collateral to get a car title loan could be one option. But car title loans aren’t a good choice for most borrowers.

Title loans often have repayment terms as short as 30 days, though you might find installment options as long as 24 months. The amount you can borrow depends on your location, as well as the value of your vehicle — as long as you own your vehicle free and clear.

Why you should avoid them: The downside? You probably already guessed it: You’ll pay significantly more in interest with a title loan than with a traditional personal loan. It’s not uncommon for car title loans to have APRs in the triple digits.

More than that, though, you’re securing the loan with one of your most important assets: your car. If you were to default on your title loan, the lender could take ownership of your vehicle.

4. Pawn shop loans

A pawn shop loan is a short-term loan that’s secured by something you own, such as jewelry or other valuables. These loans typically allow you to access money quickly, depending on how much your valuables are worth.

Pawn shop lenders typically don’t run a credit check, so these loans can seem like a good option for borrowers with poor credit or those looking for a no-credit-check loan . The pawn shop will usually offer a percentage of the pawned item’s value in loan form. You’ll need to repay the loan by an agreed-upon date, or the shop keeps the item.

Why you should avoid them: If you repay the loan as agreed, you can get your valuables back. But your pawn shop loan will have accrued interest in the interim, which you’ll also need to pay. These loans also tend to have a variety of fees tacked on, such as storage, setup, and even appraisal fees. For this reason, a lower interest rate can be deceptive, as the loan will actually end up costing you considerably more in the end.

Try a personal loan instead

If you need funds for an unexpected expense, large purchase, or even to refinance high-interest debt, a traditional personal loan is often your best bet — even if you have bad credit. Here are some things you can do to increase your chances of qualifying for one:

Apply with a cosigner. Adding a cosigner with good credit to your personal loan application may be the answer to getting approved or snagging better interest rates. Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit.

Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit. Check your credit reports. If your low credit score is keeping you from getting a personal loan, it’s important to understand why. Check your credit reports to see what sort of negative items are bringing down your score. In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected.

In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected. Consider a secured personal loan. A secured loan uses one or more of your assets as collateral for the debt. Because of this added protection, lenders often have lower credit score requirements for secured loans and may even approve borrowers with a bad credit score. Some financial institutions might not even require a minimum credit score at all, as long as you’re securing the loan with an asset. But keep in mind that if you fall behind on your loan payments, the lender can take your collateral."

WHAT IS CASH-OUT REFINANCING AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

How mortgage rates have changed over time

Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac — 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates.

When is it worth it to refinance?

Refinancing a mortgage can be a great way to save money. But it’s not always the best move for every homeowner.

People refinance for a number of reasons, including to get a lower interest rate, change their monthly payment amount and lower their interest costs. Generally, if you can lower your interest rate by at least 0.75%, refinancing might be a good move.

But before you refinance, be sure to weigh closing costs, and calculate how long it will take before your savings from the refinance cover the expenses of refinancing.

Generally, a good mortgage rate is one that’s the lowest you can qualify for based on your individual factors, such as credit history, income, other debts, down payment amount, and more.

A rate that’s good for your financial situation should result in a monthly mortgage payment that you can manage, while leaving plenty of room in your monthly budget to put toward savings, investments, and an emergency fund.

BNPL INCLUSION IN CREDIT REPORTS CAUSES GROWING CONSUMER CONCERNS, SURVEY CLAIMS

Americans coping with rising prices

Inflation is currently surging and increased in June to a new 40-year high, marking the fifth time it's broken that record this year. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 9.1% annually in June, hitting its highest point since November 1981, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

Because of this, many consumers are needing to dip into their savings or fund their purchases with credit, according to data from Morning Consult Economic Intelligence . Intentions to buy big-ticket items such as electronics, trips and vacations, home appliances and furniture have all decreased over the past year.

But despite these setbacks, consumer balance sheets are historically strong, according to Morning Consult. Net wealth as a share of disposable income is currently near a record high as household debt as a share of total assets is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, according to data from the Federal Reserve.

Because of this, some consumers, especially from higher-income households, are actually increasing their spending and expected spending, according to the Morning Consult report. Households with an annual income of at least $50,000 reported a 25% increase in monthly spending from May 2021 to May 2022.

""To put it simply: People still have the means to buy things, but they are expecting items to cost more,"" the report stated. ""And Morning Consult data indicates that they’re using BNPL to pay for some of them. The consistency with which U.S. consumers have used BNPL to fund their purchases throughout 2022 indicates that the payment form may be helping to keep their price sensitivity and substitutions at bay, and should be viewed as an indicator of the staying power of BNPL.""

If you have used BNPL to pay for your purchases and want to pay it down, consider using a personal loan to help pay your debt. Visit Credible to compare multiple lenders at once and choose the one with the best interest rate for you.

Americans continue to use BNPL options for purchases

The use of BNPL payments is not slowing, and the share of adults who used BNPL to fund a purchase at least once in the past month has not dropped below 16% in 2022, according to Morning Consult’s report.

Adults with annual income between $50,000 and $99,999 as well as those with an annual income of $100,000 or more are even more likely to have used BNPL for a purchase over the past month at 21% and 20%, respectively.

And consumers expect to continue using BNPL.

The home, which was built in 1937, was originally designed for the actress and her then-boyfriend, conductor Leopold Stokowski, the conductor for Disney’s ""Fantasia."" It’s now listed by Mark Mintz at Compass.

The property, which sits atop a hill in the Beverly Crest neighborhood, has six bedrooms and six bathrooms. It features sprawling 180-degree views spanning from downtown Los Angeles to the ocean and includes a spacious deck, lush lawns and an infinity pool. The space, which was fully renovated in 2006 by celebrated designer Nicole Sassaman, highlights open living areas, sliding glass doors, rich woods and stonework throughout.

NYC APARTMENT OF HOLLYWOOD LEGEND GRETA GARBO HITS MARKET FOR $7.25M: ‘CINEMATIC VIEWS'

The Oscar-nominated star, who was fiercely protective of her privacy, saw to it that the home kept her out of the public eye. In her lifetime, Garbo famously said, ""I just want to be left alone."" The original small windows, along with the towering exterior walls, provided a space for Garbo to leisurely roam and sunbathe in seclusion. The courtyard, which was enclosed by high walls, was well beyond the reach of photographers. It became a hot spot for Hollywood's elite to gather.

Garbo and Stokowski ultimately called it quits, and he went on to marry heiress Gloria Vanderbilt in 1945. Garbo kept the house, and it was eventually occupied by several tenants, including singer/actor Tab Hunter. A Russian filmmaker, who is the current homeowner, loved the home’s history so much that he bought it under ""Greta Garbo LLC.""

After earning three Academy Award nominations, Garbo retired at age 35 and moved to New York City, where she became a known recluse. Garbo passed away in 1990 at age 84.

Sassaman, who was also captivated by the home’s history, spent nearly two years remodeling the space, which was transformed into ""a modern marvel,"" Elle Decor reported. She doubled the living space by erecting a second story.

""The hilltop view was stunning, but the estate didn’t take advantage of it because the house had been built to keep the inhabitants in and the press out,"" Sassaman told the outlet. ""We added as much glass as city code would permit, and this tactic transformed the home from dark and secluded to open and airy.""

Sassaman also made changes to the layout of the home to enhance its charm. A patio was converted into a living room with panoramic views of both the city and the infinity pool. Garbo’s bedroom became a home office, and the primary suite was installed on the newly constructed second floor. Another outdoor patio was enclosed and added to the kitchen, which provided more space to cook, dine and entertain.

The lower bedroom and bath, previously a guest room during Hunter’s residency, became a gym. Each space in the property was specifically tweaked by Sassaman to ensure a view.

""I worked to meld the worlds of yesterday and today together,"" she said.

The curved fireplace in Garbo’s original master bedroom was retained, as was the home’s sinuous exterior. Sassaman said she also kept the home’s unusual lines to stay true to Garbo’s time.

""The first time I saw the house, I couldn't believe that it had been sitting in such a poor state for so long,"" said Sassaman. ""But I immediately saw how the home could be turned into something really special if I just let its glamorous past guide the renovation.""

Sassaman told the outlet that she stayed at the estate while building the pool and retaining wall in the backyard. She admitted it was easy to fall in love with it.

Stenhouse reportedly purchased the home in 2013 and is now looking to pass it on as he builds a new home for himself and his fiancé.

Even though there’s a chance the future buyer will be involved in the racing industry, Tucker said the home also appeals to equestrian lovers and car collectors outside the community.

I’m going to have a grand ballroom that could hold 500 people.
He deserves to see his dream come true and I’m going to do it for him.
Siegel: That’s a good example.","Jackie Siegel is determined to finish building the largest single-family home in America – no matter the cost.

The Florida mom and her family, whose lives were the subject of the 2012 documentary ""The Queen of Versailles,"" is back for the Discovery+ docuseries ""The Queen of Versailles Reigns Again."" The show explores the challenges the 56-year-old and her husband David Siegel have endured in finishing the construction of their home, a project that has been more than 20 years in the making.

The 90,000-square-foot mega-mansion, inspired by the Versailles palace in France, features six kitchens, a 35-car garage, a 150-person dining room, a grand ballroom with gemstone-encrusted floors and a British pub. Siegel also has big dreams to have a Benihana hibachi grill installed and an aviary with toucans and flamingos. When done, the mother of eight suspects the home could be worth $200 million.

The Siegels have faced numerous obstacles over the years. After buying the land for the home in 2000, construction was halted during an economic downturn that impacted patriarch David Siegel, founder of Orlando-based Westgates Resorts. The family also endured a personal tragedy when their 18-year-old daughter, Victoria Siegel, passed away in 2015 from an overdose of methadone and antidepressants.

JILL ZARIN HEADS BACK TO 'HOUSEWIVES' AFTER BUILDING BUSINESS EMPIRE: 'IT WAS LIKE I NEVER LEFT'

Today, Siegel is feeling hopeful about the future of her family – and home. And she’s inviting cameras to follow her along for the ride. Siegel spoke to FOX Business about when the home will finally be completed, how she coped with the public scrutiny following her daughter’s death and the challenges she’s currently facing.

FOX Business: What compelled you to share your story in ""Queen of Versailles Reigns Again""?

Jackie Siegel: It’s been a rough road since the original documentary came out. A lot of offers came to us over the years, but we were very wary of how we were going to be portrayed. And then we lost our daughter. My world just crumbled down from there. It felt like nothing mattered anymore. I felt such sadness. I had lost my passion to do anything. It was a sad, dark time in my life.

But then, my husband and I started our foundation because we felt we could make a difference. We felt we were in a position to help others. I felt ready. When we were approached this time around, I felt the timing was right. The foundation had become a big part of our lives… And the truth is, everywhere I go, people always approach me and ask me the same question – whatever happened to the house? So this is my answer. It covers everything people have been wanting to know.

FOX Business: The show chronicles the challenges of building a house as large as yours. Why continue to create the largest single-family home in the country?

Siegel: The thing is we’ve already got over $50 million into the house. No one is going to buy it as is. And it’s my husband’s passion. We’re not getting any younger and our kids are growing up. I want to do this for him. And the house certainly has the queen’s touch. I want to live here as a family and the structure is already there. Right now we live on a private island in the middle of the lake that we bought in the meantime. Had we gotten this property first, we probably wouldn’t have built this other house. But it’s already under construction.

Also, my kids are getting involved. They’re really excited about this project. I’m also thinking about the possibilities. I’m going to have a grand ballroom that could hold 500 people. I could do a lot of events there to raise awareness and save lives from the drug epidemic. I can use the house to gain the attention that we need to raise awareness. I could host fundraisers, do a retreat or just invite people for a charity event where I can educate them. It will also be good for our kids, our grandkids and loved ones. We already have the home and own it. Why not see it through? I've got to find a way.

FOX Business: When do you believe the house will finally be finished?

Siegel: My goal is to have the house finished by May 3, 2023. That’s my husband’s 80th birthday. He almost missed his birthday last year because he was getting back surgery and was at the hospital. He caught pneumonia and at his age, that’s really scary. He deserves to see his dream come true and I’m going to do it for him.

FOX Business: What do you believe has been the biggest challenge you’ve faced recently in getting the house completed?

Siegel: The biggest problem is that there’s more than one problem *laughs*. The house was dormant for many years and wasn’t maintained. So I have issues with the natural aging of the house. The marble was falling off the exterior, and other areas were exposed and rusty. I had to structurally fix a lot of things, which I wasn’t anticipating. So it’s almost like it was under renovation at the same time we're constructing it.

We had to knock down walls and things like that because I’m redesigning the kids’ bedrooms. They no longer need a nanny’s room connected to their room. They rather have a large closet. And with the COVID pandemic, a lot of things slowed down in terms of the supply chain. For example, the floor of my grand ballroom is going to be made with semi-precious stones. These are beautiful stones from 22 different countries all over the world. And then we had to ship them to Indonesia. I went to Indonesia to check on the floor and do some quality control, which I’m glad I did because we still had to make changes.

There’s so much to oversee. Like the library, it’s going to have one of the most ornate wooden floors you’ve ever seen. We’re going to have an artist create something for us and this is his last project before he retires. He’s out in the country outside of Paris making our floor for us. We have to come up with the design for everything – and everything is a piece of art. This is more than a home. This is a palace.

FOX Business: Your home is even going to have a British pub among its many features. Did you originally have an idea for something that just didn’t work out?

Siegel: I needed a larger closet… but I couldn’t have two stories. I want to have a closet with an elevator so I can go up or down from my house. That’s a challenge. I originally wanted to find a way to connect the house to the island where you can do some zip-lining. But there are lots of high restrictions and things need to be approved. There are code issues as well. But if the sprinklers go off, for example, the artwork would be ruined. I had to put a fireproof stairwell that’s so ugly and takes up space, but it was necessary.

FOX Business: A big dream of yours, among many, is to have a Benihana built inside the home. How’s that going?

Siegel: That’s a good example. We have to take it out… But my husband really wants it. And our family is so picky when it comes to food, but one thing they all love is Benihana. They will all show up for that. We can all sit at the table together and everybody’s happy *laughs*. That’s the main reason he wants it.

FOX Business: What’s a misconception you feel the press or the public still has about you?

Siegel: … People that I’ve never met, of course, think that I married for money. But then when they see me, they’re the first ones to go, ""Oh my God, we love you."" *laughs*. My life isn’t about flashing money around and showing off. We’re doing all of this for us. We’re private people, except our story is exposed to the media.

BETHENNY FRANKEL REFLECTS ON HER BUSINESS EMPIRE, SKINNYGIRL'S FUTURE: 'I LIKE THAT BLOOD, SWEAT, TEARS'

… But the truth is, my family and our future come first. I’m still a small hometown girl at heart. My boys told me, ""Since we’re building a house like this one, we should really have a family crest."" If you would have asked me what a family crest was, I would pull out a tube of toothpaste! I’ve always been the same.

FOX Business: What kept you going after losing your daughter?

Siegel: … It was difficult, losing your child and then having the headlines bash family… Meanwhile, you’re mourning and wondering, ""What did I do wrong?"" But you can’t live with guilt your whole life. And those newspapers actually did us a favor because they pushed me and gave me the strength to speak about our experience publicly so that other parents are spared from going through a similar pain.

This notoriety puts me in a position where my voice can be heard. And it helps me to know that my daughter didn’t die in vain, that her story is, in some way, saving so many other lives. That so many people are learning about the impact of the opioid crisis. It helps with my healing process."

John McGraw, former chairman of McGraw-Hill Publishing, and his wife, Marjorie, were the first to purchase the property from the Garbo estate in 2017 for $8.5 million.

The McGraws took it upon themselves to renovate areas of the home, such as the kitchen and dining room, while preserving much of the home's Garbo-fashioned elements and spaces.

""This home is for the discerning buyer who is seeking dramatic, cinematic river and city views and the elegance that defined Garbo.""

Listing agent Brian Lewis of Compass Real Estate disclosed in an interview with Fox News Digital that the McGraws are choosing to sell the apartment now that they're spending a majority of their time away with family.

They would rather the home be enjoyed by ""someone who can really be there.""

And it’s not only with Marilyn items.","Marilyn Monroe’s market value is still shining brightly 60 years after her death.

The Hollywood actress, also known as America’s most famous sex symbol, died in August 1962 at age 36. According to reports, the star had a net worth of $800K at the time of her death, which is nearly $8 million in today's money.

Monroe’s net worth in 2022 is a reported $10 million. In 2020, she ranked No. 13 on Forbes’ list of highest-paid dead celebrities due to her image and name being used by nearly 100 brands globally. A fictionalized version of the star is the subject of an upcoming Netflix film, ""Blonde,"" which has received an NC-17 rating.

Scott Fortner, a lifelong fan, is determined to keep Monroe’s legacy alive by preserving some of her most prized possessions. Fortner, who is considered an authority on Monroe, assists major auction companies in authenticating and verifying memorabilia.

REMEMBERING MARILYN MONROE, ACTRESS, FASHION ICON, AND SEX SYMBOL 60 YEARS AFTER HER DEATH

He owns the world’s largest private collection of Monroe’s personal property and archives, which he shares on both his website and social media.

This year, he’ll be celebrating her life at several events at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California.

Fortner spoke to FOX Business about how he became a sought-after collector and why Monroe is more valuable than ever and offered his advice for fans eager to obtain an authentic piece of history.

FOX Business: How did you end up becoming a Marilyn Monroe memorabilia collector?

Scott Fortner: Like anyone, you’re just taken by someone or find yourself very interested in a particular figure. That’s what happened to me when I was probably 12 or 13. I was really fascinated by Marilyn Monroe. I started collecting books and magazines as I read and learned more about her. This continued through adulthood.

Then, in 1999, her entire estate was put up for auction at Christie’s in New York. That auction really set the stage for celebrity auctions. I acquired the catalog from the auction, which became another book for my collection. But then I started to see some items from the 1999 sale that were being resold online on eBay and at other auction houses.

I thought to myself, ""Why am I collecting books and magazines when I could be collecting items that Marilyn owned?"" That’s how it started over two decades ago. … This isn’t an organization or a company investing in these items for business purposes or other concepts. I just happen to be a fan who’s lucky enough to collect.

FOX Business: Do your items ever get loaned out to museums or is it strictly private?

Fortner: As someone lucky enough to obtain these items, I feel a bit of an obligation and a duty to share them with the rest of the world and give other fans an opportunity to see Marilyn through her objects in the same way that I do.

I loan my collection for exhibitions. It’s been on exhibit around the world. I’ve often participated in opportunities to raise money for charitable causes. For example, some items have been on display to raise money for the actual orphanage where Marilyn lived as a child, which is still in business today.

FOX Business: What’s your process like in finding authentic memorabilia?

Fortner: When I first started, I didn’t know much about the auction business as we know it today. Over the years, I’ve come to learn more about the auction industry. I’m now connected with most of the major auction companies around the world, such as Christie’s, Julien’s Auctions and Heritage. Those are your top auction companies for entertainment memorabilia.

I’m also pretty well known in the collecting community. A lot of times people will reach out to me privately to see if I might be interested in purchasing something that they may have. I believe networking and learning are really important if you want to expand your collection. And I’m always looking for the next thing to add to my collection.

FOX Business: How many items do you currently own?

Fortner: I don’t have an exact number anymore. I stopped counting. But it’s in the several hundreds.

FOX Business: What would you say is your crown jewel?

Fortner: The item that I get asked the most about is Marilyn’s personal Pucci blouse. During the last few years of her life, she wore Pucci quite a lot. It was an Italian designer that she discovered, which shifted her look away from the ‘50s, such as the tight skirts and sweaters. It was a more modern, easier look. She had several Pucci items in her closet. She was also buried in a green Pucci dress. So the brand has become synonymous with Marilyn.

The blouse I own happens to be the blouse she was wearing in the photos taken on the weekend before she passed away, the last photos ever taken of her alive. It’s the item I get frequently asked about in terms of selling. It’s not for sale. I’m a collector, not a dealer.

The most recent item I’ve added to my collection is something I’ve wanted for quite some time. It’s a pair of Marilyn’s Ferragamo high heels. The white Ferragamo high heel was a go-to look for her. There are countless photos of Marilyn wearing them throughout the ‘50s and ‘60s. It’s a new staple in my collection that I added just last month.

MARILYN MONROE’S FIGURE-HUGGING GOWN BECOMES TOP SELLER AT AUCTION: SHE’S ‘STILL TURNING HEADS TO THIS DAY’

FOX Business: Which item was the hardest for you to obtain?

Fortner: Marilyn attended a benefit for the Actor’s Studio. She was an usherette. People would come into the theater, and Marilyn would escort them to their seats and hand them a program. I’m sure that must have been quite the experience to be escorted by Marilyn. She wore an ensemble that consisted of an evening dress and a matching cape. That item came up for auction several years ago. I bid on the item and was told that I had won. It turned out that it didn’t make the minimum bid or the reserve.

A lot of times, a seller will say, ""If it doesn’t reach this certain amount, I’m not going to sell the item."" I found out after the auction and I went through the grueling process of attempting to negotiate with the seller. I bought it privately after the fact. It took several months for that to happen. But I was fortunate because it’s probably one of Marilyn’s most well-known public events. Now I have that cape as part of my collection.

FOX Business: Marilyn passed away 60 years ago. Why do you believe she’s more valuable than ever?

Fortner: For starters, she’s an icon. And I think people relate to her in so many ways today. Some people just enjoy her photos. Others enjoy her films. Some people relate to the personal struggles that she endured throughout her life. What I often find is that people feel a connection to her. There’s a sense of wanting to protect her. I think her appeal is very broad. And it’s not just in the United States — it’s worldwide. I’ve connected with other collectors and fans around the world, so her reach is very extensive and long-lasting. She’s an icon of beauty, for fashion and a legend of the silver screen.

FOX Business: How difficult is it to find and buy authentic Marilyn memorabilia today?

Fortner: What I’m seeing now is that people are very much holding onto their collectibles and memorabilia because it is increasing in value as time goes by. So whenever there is an auction, the number of pieces available can be very limiting. And Marilyn is one of those people whose value doesn’t decrease. She holds value and increases in value. So people aren’t as quick to put up their items for auction. Therefore, the availability is getting harder.

MARILYN MONROE'S DRESSES FROM POPULAR MOVIES UP FOR AUCTION

FOX Business: How can one determine whether an item is authentic or not? What are some tell-tale signs you look out for?

Fortner: One of the first things you want to do is ensure you’re verifying authenticity. Where did the item come from? Did it come from that 1999 Christie’s sale or another auction sale, such as from Julien’s? You want to make sure it came from a major auction company and verify the year it was originally sold. Also, is there a photo that can be matched with the item? Is there a photo of Marilyn wearing the item, whether it was at home or a public event? Many items from my collection are photographed with Marilyn.

What I tell people to avoid is what I call second- or third-generation items, such as a seller saying, ""Marilyn gave this to me."" Those items usually come with a letter or certificate of authenticity. Those items are very risky purchases and, usually, they’re not authentic. There’s a huge market today, particularly on eBay, where people will create certificates of authenticity claiming this is an authentic item when, in reality, it was probably something acquired from a secondhand store. They’ll just purchase the item, create a letter of authenticity, and then sell it for thousands of dollars on eBay. Unfortunately, many people tend to believe an item is real just because it comes with a certificate claiming it came from Marilyn’s makeup artist or hairstylist. Usually, that’s not the case.

I’m so often contacted by people who say, ""I’ve got this item for sale, and here’s the letter of authenticity for it."" I’m in the position of having to tell them, ""This item is not real, and here’s how I know that."" A perfect example involves Marilyn’s foster sister, Bebe Goddard. Marilyn lived with the Goddard family for some time. [Later on], Bebe worked with a memorabilia dealer to create items that he sold for her, which were fake pieces. They even went as far as to spray Chanel No. 5 on those items. After she passed away, it was verified through her documents that these items were sold to people. Just because it was someone who was a part of Marilyn’s life, people believed they were real. And these items came with a certificate of authenticity claiming they were real.

Today, people continue to create these fake letters of authenticity. And it’s not only with Marilyn items. It’s with all kinds of celebrity memorabilia. There are a few real items on eBay that are authentic. I would advise people to stick with the major auction companies.

NYC APARTMENT OF HOLLYWOOD LEGEND GRETA GARBO HITS MARKET FOR $7.25M: ‘CINEMATIC VIEWS'

Also, autographs are very easy to forge. Today’s printers are so good. You can easily take a check, even an authentic Marilyn-owned check, and do a photocopy on the front and back. Then you’ll frame that item in a display case. A lot of times, people will do that. And, of course, many will think it’s real when, in reality, it’s just a copy. There are many other ways people forge signatures, even in autograph books and photographs. You have to do your homework and make sure that the item you’re purchasing is truly authentic.

FOX Business: What about if you’re a Marilyn fan and want to own something that once belonged to her? What’s the first piece of advice you would give them?

Fortner: My first piece of advice is to make sure this is something you’re going to have interest in the long-term, not just a spur-of-the-moment purchase. You don’t want to have buyer’s remorse. Also, set a budget. Auctions can get very emotional. It’s also very competitive. For some people, they just want to win. You want to make sure you set a budget and try not to go over it.

People also tend to forget there are premiums that the auction companies apply as part of selling an item, as well as taxes. I have come across people who don’t realize that, after winning an auction, there’s a certain percentage on top of that for the premium and then another percentage on top of that for state taxes. It does add up. I would also stick to the major auction companies, especially if you’re starting.

FOX Business: Every year, Marilyn continues to be one of the top-earning dead celebrities. How is she earning top dollar today?

Fortner: Marilyn’s estate is owned by Authentic Brands Group, which is a company that owns the rights, licenses, marketing, advertising and branding for many deceased celebrities. They license Marilyn’s name and image to people who want to promote certain products. She’s still very much in demand, which is why Marilyn is one of the highest-earning dead celebrities today."

What happened was just the opposite, and as the Supreme Court considers President Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate and COVID-19 testing rules for the nation’s businesses, justices should look closely at what appears to be a successful test of whether requiring vaccinations will be the key to the nation moving safely back to normal.

CTA, the consumer technology trade association that represents the $422 billion U.S. consumer tech industry and runs CES, decided to create its in-person show model from scratch. CTA President and CEO Gary Shapiro didn’t waver even as more than a dozen tech leaders scrubbed their travel plans. He insisted the show would go on.

In fact, it would be more than just another Vegas convention: it would be the first large-scale test in the nation of whether a massive indoor event drawing thousands of people from all over the world could be pulled off in the middle of a highly contagious pandemic without turning into a superspreader event.

How CES Tackled the Challenge

It wouldn’t be easy. Well before omicron was even identified, CTA began preparing. It put in a mass order with Abbott Labs for the company’s BinaxNOW COVID-19 rapid self-test kits and began working with health experts and Nevada’s Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak to formulate the protocols and the plan.

Upon arrival in Las Vegas, attendees would be required to present that proof at one of dozens of booths CES set up at airports, hotels and the convention center, after which they’d be handed their official credential and two free rapid COVID-19 tests. Masks would be required at all times on the convention floor and the 10 other CES venues around the city. Journalists could only remove their masks during live interviews. There would be free rapid testing at the convention center for the duration of the four-day event. The convention center, which spans more than 4 million square feet of exhibition space, was outfitted with enhanced air filtration systems, and international travelers would get a free PCR test after the show ended.

On Dec. 30, the nation set a devastating record: the highest number of daily infections reported.

By Dec. 31, citing the need for additional safety measures, CES announced it was dropping the last day of the four-day convention.

Business television networks Bloomberg and CNBC pulled out. My crew and I were still in. I made my pact when I chose this profession. Given a choice, I would run toward news stories. As a local news reporter, I’ve covered Category 5 hurricanes, riots, crack house busts and toxic explosions. Frank Merola, one of the FBN photographers coming with me to Vegas, had rushed to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster to cover it for the network. We would remain vigilant the entire trip.

Experts Weigh In

I won’t say I wasn’t concerned. I reached out to Dr. Harry Sax, executive vice chair of surgery at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. When I told him I was going to cover CES, he thought for a moment and then said, ""I think it’s important that you go. As long as you mitigate risk. Think about it. We don’t want planes to crash, but the answer isn’t ‘don’t fly planes.’ That’s not acceptable or realistic. The answer is, mitigate risk as best you can and then move forward. This vaccine-only event appears to be aiming for that. CES will be a test observed by the world.""

What It Was Like

Armed with a healthy dose of paranoia, my team and I arrived in Vegas on Jan. 4 to find greatly diminished crowds. At its peak in 2019, CES drew 170,000 exhibitors and leaders. This time, the final tally would shrink more than 70% to just over 45,000. But just as big names pulled out, 2,300 small- and medium-sized businesses, along with major names from Samsung to Chrysler parent Stellantis to smartphone chip giant Qualcomm to farm equipment maker John Deere (which brought a 44,000-pound autonomous tractor), arrived.

Before a large crowd Tuesday night, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon unveiled a virtual reality headset for the metaverse. Qualcomm is partnering with Microsoft to create the new digital universe hardware. Amon told FOX Business, ""We’re happy to be here. We had a press conference yesterday. People told me there are (only) going to be five people in the room, but we actually had a full room of 250 people.""

Thursday night, CTA also made the decision to hold its annual Leaders in Technology dinner at the Wynn Cristal Ballroom. VIPs, including a dozen members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, attended. In order to maintain social distance, organizers limited tables to seven people each vs. the usual 10.

Did It Work?

Sunday, CTA gave some final numbers. More than 2,300 businesses had voluntarily bought into the mandate and made the trip to CES, as did 4,500 attendees. Shapiro told FOX Business, ""At this point, I am aware of only a few positive COVID tests of actual CES attendees."" While he declined to give specific numbers because CTA was still compiling exact figures, I can say not one of my crew tested positive, even though there were points during the three-day conference when we were surrounded by crowds. Because of the CES rules, those crowds were all masked and vaccinated.

As the Supreme Court ponders whether the federal government has the authority to impose such mandates, leaving it up to businesses to impose mandates appropriate for their workforce is a good idea and CES proves that businesses will buy into such a policy when it furthers their business interests. Moreover, the mandates required by CES appear to have worked.

So, however the Supreme Court rules, businesses should stick to a mandate policy. If 45,000 people congregating indoors can avoid being a superspreader event because of vaccination and mask mandates, then let's have corporations spread these super best practices far and wide."

How to detect spyware

Spyware surreptitiously gathers information about you, such as internet usage data, and then sends it to another party. The most malicious spyware will install software that changes the settings on your phone and/or steals usernames and passwords.

It typically lands on your phone along with a program or app that you installed yourself. ""Spyware often accompanies programs that are disguised as useful software, such as download managers, registry cleaners, and so on,"" Internet security company Kaspersky says.

DHS REQUIRES 'CRITICAL' PIPELINES TO AMP UP CYBERSECURITY PROTECTIONS IN WAKE OF COLONIAL PIPELINE HACK

In some cases, spyware is secretly installed by a parent but it may also be installed by a suspicious partner, according to a spyware primer from Avast, which offers internet security applications.

Some indicators of spyware can be an overheating phone, a battery that drains too fast, excessive data usage, and annoying messages that pop up when you’re browsing the internet, Avast says.

How to remove spyware

Think you have spyware? Spyware removal tools may help in detecting and removing it. Anti-virus companies such as McAfee offer spyware removal apps.

You can also manually remove suspicious apps that you don’t recognize. Just follow iOS or Android instructions for deleting apps on your phone.

In a worst-case scenario, you can do a factory reset of your phone. This will erase all data from your phone, including the spyware. But you need to make sure the backup you use for the reset is dated before you got the spyware, says Avast.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

One of the best strategies is to make sure your phone’s operating system software is up to date.

""Some iPhone spy software is effective only because of an iOS security flaw. Hackers are always looking for software vulnerabilities to exploit, which Apple regularly fixes via Apple security updates,"" says Avast. So, the best way to stop the spyware is updating to the latest iOS release."

Weird to normalOne of the worst things about change is that the new way of doing things just feels weird.
Having the ability to accept and respond well to necessary change is going to become more important with every passing day.
Therefore, I invite you to rewire yourself in this way: to learn to think and feel differently about change; to become change-capable.
Erika Andersen is the founding partner of Proteus, a coaching, consulting and training firm that focuses on leader readiness.","Think of the last time your boss, your boss's boss or an HR person told you that a change was coming – some new way to do something, or a restructuring, or a new system to learn.

If you’re like most people, your first reaction was probably more negative than positive. Perhaps something like: ""Arrgh, as if the past eighteen months haven’t been stressful enough…"" – along with a sinking feeling and a sense of being newly overwhelmed.

Why is the idea of change – especially change imposed upon us – so often unwelcome? Given the past few years of massive change and disruption on so many levels, you’d think we would have gotten used to non-stop personal and professional change by now.

Our Anti-Change Wiring

Blame our experience as a species. For most of human history, change has been dangerous; the safest course of action has generally been to return to the known. If there was a famine, you wanted to get back to eating regularly. If there was an invading army, you wanted to get back to peace and prosperity.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS

You get the idea. Most of the time, returning to a previous set of stable conditions was the way to go.

Over many thousands of years, this has resulted in most people seeing most change as a threat. But today, to be successful, we often have to make changes in how we work, who we work with, and how we deal with customers.

So, what’s a human to do? Try these five things:

1. Find out more

When an unexpected change comes at us, we often just shut down and stop listening after the word ""different."" But there’s some key information about any change that will help you decide how best to respond. First, ask for more clarity about what the change is – what it means for you, practically. Then ask why it’s happening, so you get some sense of possible benefits. Finally, ask the person promoting the change what the post-change future will look like – how it will affect the business, the customers, the employees. Having this key information can make the change start to seem less overwhelming and more understandable.



2. Difficult to doable

Most often, when we first hear about a change, we assume it’s going to be difficult – that we won’t know how to do it, or that others will make it hard to do. Instead, turn your mind toward how you could make it easier. Is there someone who already knows how to do what you’re being asked to do, who could help you? Is there training available? Can you talk to your boss about what it will take?

3. Costly to rewarding

We also tend to think that a change is going to take away more than it gives us: that learning how to do it will take time we can’t spare or that it will hurt our reputation – that we’ll look bad trying to do something we’re not used to doing. The change will seem less daunting if you can also focus on how it might be rewarding: maybe the new way of doing things will take less time, once you’ve learned it, or will solve a problem that you know customers have been complaining about.

4. Weird to normal

One of the worst things about change is that the new way of doing things just feels weird. Anyone who’s ever had to learn to drive a stick shift as an adult, for instance, or gone to a religious celebration of another faith, knows that feeling of ""this just isn’t what I’m used to.""

Making a change feel normal is an important way to get past our hesitation, and sometimes the quickest way to do that is to find someone you like and respect who understands and is doing things in the new way and ask them to share with you what feels OK about it to them.

5. Practice makes perfect … or at Least OK

And finally, perhaps, the most important way to get comfortable with a new way of doing things or thinking about things is to do it. And then do it again.

If you think about anything you’ve learned as an adult – from swing dancing to speaking another language, to using a new social media platform – you probably remember the day when you had practiced enough that you suddenly thought, ""Oh, this isn’t so hard."" Once you’ve gotten some basic information about the change and started to look for ways it could be easy (or at least doable), rewarding and normal, take a deep breath and just jump into trying it out.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

Every indication is that the pace of change in our lives and in the world is going to continue to increase. It doesn’t look like we’re ever going to return to a time when everything is mostly status quo. Having the ability to accept and respond well to necessary change is going to become more important with every passing day.

Therefore, I invite you to rewire yourself in this way: to learn to think and feel differently about change; to become change-capable. It’s your best path to a successful, satisfying personal and professional life in this era of non-stop change.

""The mission of Telosa is to create a more equitable, sustainable future. That’s our North Star,"" Lore said in a promotional video. ""We are going to be the most open, the most fair and the most inclusive city in the world.""

WALMART INVESTING NEARLY $1B TO COVER TUITION, BOOK COSTS FOR US EMPLOYEES

Key to the city’s plans is Lore’s economic vision, called ""Equitism,"" in which the land upon which the city is built will be donated to a community endowment.

Residents, in turn, own their homes on the land and are enriched as home values increase, according to the project’s site, and after a period of ""hyper-growth,"" residents can buy the land from the community endowment.

""If you went into the desert where the land was worth nothing, or very little, and you created a foundation that owned the land, and people moved there and tax dollars built infrastructure and we built one of the greatest cities in the world, the foundation could be worth a trillion dollars,"" Lore told Bloomberg Businessweek.

""And if the foundation’s mission was to take the appreciation of the land and give it back to the citizens in the form of medicine, education, affordable housing, social services: Wow, that’s it!""

The city is meant to take on what Lore views as the United States’ biggest challenge — the rapidly growing wealth gap, which he said ""is going to bring down America.""

""While the current economic system is a growth engine, it has led to increasing inequality,"" the project’s website explains. ""Equitism is inclusive growth.""

The initial phase of the project, targeted for completion by 2030, would be built to accommodate 50,000 residents across roughly 1,500 acres at a cost of $25 billion, Businessweek reported.

Over 40 years, the city will eventually require $400 billion in funding and grow to house as many as 5 million people across 150,000 acres, the site says.

The project’s planners have yet to commit to a location, but the website identifies Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Texas and the Appalachian region as possible sites.

In June, Lore hired Copenhagen-based architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group to design the city.

Sleek renderings imagine plenty of space for pedestrians to stroll in the lush metropolis, and include images of planes and other aircrafts that appear to be from Archer Aviation, the electric ""air taxi"" startup in which Lore is an investor.

Another image on the site shows a skyscraper called Equitism tower that houses elevated water storage, aeroponic farms and an energy-producing roof.

The streets ""prioritize bikes and pedestrians,"" according to the website, and slow-moving self-driving cars share the street.

Lore, who reportedly has a net worth of up to $4 billion, founded Quidsi, a company that owned e-commerce sites including diapers.com, and sold it to Amazon in 2010 for around $545 million.

He left Amazon after two years and founded Jet.com before selling it to Walmart in 2016, joining the retail giant as head of US e-commerce.

The chronic entrepreneur left the company earlier this year to pursue other projects that were unannounced at the time.

He’s since bought a stake in the Minnesota Timberwolves and Lynx, and started a new venture capital firm with Alex Rodriguez called Vision Capital People.

The typical living costs for a full-time college student during the 2022-23 academic year will range from $20,470 on a low budget to $30,560 on a moderate budget, according to College Board . That’s a substantial chunk of change for college students already tasked with covering their school tuition, often with student loans.

The good news is student loans cover more than just tuition. You can use student loans to pay for living expenses like room and board, transportation, and miscellaneous costs. Here’s a closer look at how to pay for college living expenses, including what you can and can’t pay for with student loans.



Credible lets you compare private student loan rates from multiple lenders, all in one place.

You can use student loans for living expenses

Your lender generally disburses student loan funds directly to your school to pay for your tuition and fees. Any remaining funds are paid to you, and you can use the money to cover living expenses and other costs related to your education.

Before you apply for student loans , always begin by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) . Schools use this form to determine what types of federal aid you qualify for. Exhaust all your FAFSA options — like scholarships, grants, and federal loans — before turning to private student loans to bridge any funding gaps.

Student loans backed by the federal government provide access to better benefits, like low, fixed rates, access to income-driven repayment plans, and the potential for loan forgiveness. Additionally, federal student loans may be easier to obtain if you have bad credit since they don’t require a credit check or consider your credit score.

Also, keep in mind that some student loans come with limits which will determine your borrowing amount. You might receive more money if you’re a graduate student, as graduate student loans typically carry substantially higher limits than undergraduate loans.

For example, undergraduates may qualify for a Direct Unsubsidized Loan with limits ranging from $5,500 and $12,500 per year, depending on whether you’re a dependent or an independent student. By contrast, student loan limits for graduates and professionals top out at $20,500 per year.

The amount you may borrow in private student loans varies from lender to lender, but many offer loan amounts up to 100% of the cost of attendance.

What expenses can you pay for with student loans?

Student loans are intended to help you pay for expenses that fall under the cost of attendance (COA) for your school, including:

Tuition

Education-related fees, such as registration, graduation, and parking

Textbooks

Room and board

Housing utilities

Housing supplies

Transportation expenses

Computers

Food and meal plans

Dependent care

Disability expenses

Consult with your school’s financial aid office to determine the COA for your school and for more information on acceptable uses for student loan funds.



If you need to take out private student loans, visit Credible to compare private student loan rates from various lenders in minutes.

What can’t student loans be used for?

The list of expenses you can pay for with federal or private student loan funds is extensive, but there are exceptions. Aim to keep your student loan debt low by being mindful of how you spend your loan funds, and try to use them sparingly for essential expenses as necessary.

Along those lines, you can’t use student loans for unapproved expenses, such as:

Clothing

Video games

Business expenses

Down payment on a home

Entertainment

Vacations

New vehicle (but gas, operation, and maintenance expenses are allowed)

Remember, when you sign for a student loan , you agree only to use the money to pay for your education and related expenses. If the U.S. Department of Education discovers that you used student loan funds for unapproved expenses, they may cancel your loan agreement and seek immediate repayment.

Other ways to pay for living expenses while in college

If you need to take out private student loans, visit Credible to compare private student loan rates from various lenders in minutes.

Can you get a student loan with a 600 credit score?

In most cases, if you have bad credit, your options may be more limited if you want to qualify for a private student loan on your own — many lenders typically require good credit and a steady source of income to qualify.

Some lenders may offer student loans for borrowers with bad credit , but these loans may come with higher interest rates compared to loans for borrowers with good credit. You can consider taking out a loan with a cosigner who has good credit so that you can increase your chances of qualifying for a loan or of getting a better rate.

It’s important to find a cosigner you trust and to look for a loan that offers a cosigner release if you want that option. When doing your research, see if the lender offers a cosigner release option and what the requirements are. For example, some lenders may require you to make a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments before you can apply for a cosigner release."

Moving students into separate housing, she said, ""is kind of closing the barn door after the horse is gone.""
""The method or approach to providing content and makeup work for the students is at the instructor's discretion,"" the school said.","Colleges this fall are no longer treating Covid-19 as an emergency upending their operations, shifting to eliminate mask requirements and mandatory coronavirus testing and letting students who contract the virus isolate in their dorms with their roommates.

With easy access to vaccinations and low hospitalization rates among college-aged adults -- even during the latest surge in BA.5 subvariant cases -- administrators said it is time to lift or at least rethink restrictions and redefine the virus as endemic, not a pandemic. That means scaling back mass testing, removing bans on large indoor gatherings and preparing for a fall term that more closely resembles life before Covid.

Another issue driving the decisions is exhaustion, according to public-health experts and academics on several campuses. Students and staff have been subjected to two years of daily health checks, weekly trots to a testing center and a roller coaster of mask protocols.

""It really comes down to a change in mind-set,"" said Ken Henderson, who was co-chair of Northeastern University's Covid-management operations until the group disbanded in January. Citing clinical therapies and the reduced severity of current variants, he said, ""We've pivoted significantly to more living with the virus.""

DESPITE HIGH INFLATION, BACK-TO-SCHOOL SPENDING PROJECTED TO HIT $37B

Northeastern is mandating vaccines and boosters for the fall, but already eliminated indoor mask mandates and surveillance testing and no longer offers dedicated isolation space for infected students.

""Campuses are moving in the direction of pretending Covid is no longer an issue,"" said Chris Marsicano, an assistant professor of educational studies at Davidson College who has been tracking colleges' responses to Covid since early 2020. ""When there's a flare-up, treat the flare-up. Don't have restrictions all the time.""

That should be fine for most students and staff who are vaccinated and not immunocompromised, said A. David Paltiel, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health. But ""indifference to off-campus transmission and transmission to more vulnerable members of the community is a little bit heartbreaking.""

Schools said they could still reverse course if variants lead to more-severe illness or local health officials recommend changes.

One of the biggest changes schools are making is dropping surveillance testing of asymptomatic students and staff, and, with that shift, abandoning online dashboards that tracked cases and positivity rates the past two years.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION CANCELING $6 BILLION IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR 200,000 BORROWERS

The College of Charleston in South Carolina isn't requiring students to show negative Covid-19 tests upon arrival this fall, said Alicia Caudill, executive vice president for student affairs. The school did require entry testing last year. She said the college will have thousands of at-home tests and KN-95 masks for students who want them.

""You have to make the best decisions for yourself,"" rather than relying on blanket policies from the school, Ms. Caudill said.

Georgia Institute of Technology did away with asymptomatic surveillance testing in July and instead will study wastewater to try to detect large outbreaks.

Dr. Paltiel said that approach makes sense, given how quickly the latest Omicron subvariants seem to be spreading, and how virulent future strains might be.

""You're sounding like the generals who are always getting ready to fight the previous war,"" he said of schools sticking with old approaches, like mandatory weekly testing.

Most schools are maintaining vaccine mandates, but some are adjusting who is covered by the rules or exactly what counts as being vaccinated.

BOSTON UNIVERSITY ISSUES LARGEST TUITION INCREASE IN 14 YEARS, BLAMES INFLATION

The board of trustees at San Joaquin Delta College in California voted last month to remove vaccine and booster requirements for students.

""We're trying to be flexible while recognizing that we really do need to provide in-person services,"" said spokesman Alex Breitler, adding that unvaccinated students previously couldn't participate in hands-on programs.

The State University of New York's Orange County Community College isn't mandating boosters this fall, while the San Diego Community College District no longer requires vaccines for students. The district maintains a mask mandate.

Schools are often issuing guidance that students who test positive for Covid isolate in place, meaning they lock down in their dorms, even with uninfected roommates, rather than moving to other designated housing while contagious.

In its guidance for the fall, Cornell University recommended that students who test positive ""wear a high-quality mask at all times except when eating, sleeping or using bathroom facilities (e.g., showering, brushing teeth).""

University of California, Irvine, set aside 166 beds for isolation housing this fall, down from 362 in the spring. David Souleles, director of the school's Covid-19 response team, said that is partly in response to updated guidance from public-health officials. Cutting isolation beds will also free up more beds for the general student population in the midst of a housing crunch.

MISSOURI UNIVERSITY AGREES TO $1.65 MILLION SETTLEMENT IN COVID-19 LAWSUIT FROM STUDENTS

Leslie Bienen, a public-health researcher at Oregon Health and Science University-Portland State University School of Public Health, said that by the time one roommate tests positive for Covid, chances are anyone else they lived with was already exposed.

Moving students into separate housing, she said, ""is kind of closing the barn door after the horse is gone.""

As in-person classes once again become the norm, schools are scaling back their online and hybrid offerings -- including for students who fall ill.

How mortgage rates have changed over time

Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac – 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates. When considering a mortgage refinance or purchase, it’s important to take into account closing costs such as appraisal, application, origination and attorney’s fees.

Everyone’s situation is different, but generally, it may be a good time to refinance if:

You’ll be able to get a lower interest rate than you currently have.

Refinancing will save you money over the life of your home loan.

Your savings from refinancing will ultimately exceed closing costs.

You know you’ll be staying in your home long enough to recoup the costs of refinancing.

You have sufficient equity in your home to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI).

If your home needs significant, costly repairs it might be a good time to refinance in order to withdraw some equity to pay for those repairs. Just be aware that lenders generally limit the amount you can take from your home in a cash-out refinance.

The Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF generally invests in U.S. Treasury bonds that mature in three to 10 years.","In 1994, financial planner William Bengen laid out a compelling case for a very simple retirement withdrawal strategy that is now commonly known as the 4% rule. His work showed how an investment strategy diversified across common stocks and intermediate-term Treasury bonds could help a retiree navigate a 30-year retirement with very little chance of running out of money.

Today, in the age of low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on indexes, it becomes pretty simple to create such a portfolio with just two funds. For stocks, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is certainly worth considering. For intermediate Treasury bonds, it's hard to beat the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury Fund Index ETF.

FIDELITY LAUNCHES CRYPTO, METAVERSE ETFS

How the 4% rule works

Bengen's work that came up with the 4% rule focused on retirees who maintained a well-diversified portfolio that was somewhere between a mix of 75% stocks and 25% bonds and a 50-50 mix of the two. He looked back across historical market returns and inflation rates and assumed that a retiree would want to maintain a steady lifestyle throughout retirement, after accounting for inflation.

With those assumptions in place, he checked to see how much a person could withdraw every year and still have a very strong chance of winding up completing a 30-year retirement without running out of money. He calculated that by keeping that diversified and balanced portfolio, a retiree could start by spending 4% of the portfolio's initial account balance and adjust those withdrawals for inflation each year.

Say, for instance, that you expect to need $48,000 a year in retirement ($4,000 per month) to cover your costs and that Social Security should provide you around $1,500 per month. Since Social Security adjusts its payout for inflation each year, you'd need your nest egg to cover the other $2,500 per month -- $30,000 per year. Thanks to the 4% rule, it looks like you could cover that gap with a nest egg of $750,000 across the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight and the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETFs.

Why include the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF?

The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF invests in the same companies that make up most S&P 500 trackers, but it does so a little bit differently. While the typical S&P 500 fund is market-capitalization weighted, the Invesco ETF uses an equal-weighting strategy. In other words, it seeks to own about the same dollar amount in each company in that index.

That gives the Invesco ETF a leg up on diversification, as by market capitalization, the top 10 companies (11 securities due to different share classes) represent nearly 30% of the index. By contrast, in the Invesco ETF, the top 10 holdings represent less than 2.7% of the fund's holdings. That means the Invesco fund is less exposed to challenges that face the largest companies in that index than the typical S&P 500 fund is.

It offers that diversification benefit while still carrying a modest 0.2% expense ratio, which means that the fund's shareholders get virtually all the returns of owning the underlying stocks. Between that modest expense ratio and that diversified portfolio of S&P 500 stocks, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is worthy of consideration for the stock allocation of your retirement portfolio.

Why include the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF?

The Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF generally invests in U.S. Treasury bonds that mature in three to 10 years.

That time frame is important. As an intermediate-term bond fund, it doesn't own the bonds with the shortest or the longest maturity dates. That three-to-10-year range can provide a sweet spot where the bonds offer higher interest rates than the shortest-term bonds but don't fall in price nearly as far as long-term bonds can when rates rise.

In addition, as an ETF that owns Treasury bonds, it faces a fairly low default risk. The U.S. government can print dollars while generally borrowing in dollar-denominated bonds. While printing money can drive inflation, that combination -- along with the government's ability to tax -- does provide a very high likelihood that U.S. Treasury debt will be paid.

Although intermediate-term Treasury bonds are not likely to provide a high rate of return over time, they do offer more stability of pricing than stocks do. That's why they play a role in the 4% rule: to make sure you have some higher-certainty money available when you need spending cash. With a nearly invisible 0.05% expense ratio, investors in the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF get the benefits of owning those bonds for very low overhead.

Two funds for a great future

The beauty of these two ETFs is that not only can they be the core to your plan once you retire, but you can also use them while you're accumulating your retirement nest egg as well. With a longer time horizon while you're still working, you'll likely want to tilt your allocation more heavily toward the stock fund.

As your retirement approaches, you'll want to draw closer to the balanced allocation that's so important when you're spending down your nest egg. Still, you can get away with just these two ETFs and have a great shot at making it to (and through) a financially comfortable retirement.

Planning on hold

More than 40% of the general population put their retirement planning on hold during the pandemic, and that number was even higher, at 55%, among young investors ages 18-35. In fact, nearly half of respondents from that next generation said they do not even see a point in saving for their later years until things return to ""normal.""

Of the next-geners who quit their jobs during the Great Resignation and had a 401(k), 1 in 5, or 21%, cashed out their accounts after leaving.

""The fact that so many people who left their jobs as a result of the Great Resignation also cashed out of their 401(k)s may be cause for concern,"" said Rita Assaf, vice president of retirement at Fidelity. ""Taking money out of your retirement accounts completely should be avoided unless the immediate need is critical and there are no other options, not only because of the tax implications, but also due to the impact on your retirement nest egg.""

Inflation emerges

Although a majority of Americans expressed optimism that hang-ups from the past two years are behind them, with 65% of those polled telling Fidelity that 2022 is their year for waving goodbye to the pandemic and looking to the future, numbers show a new fear has emerged: inflation.

One of the biggest concerns Fidelity observed was that 71% of Americans are worried about inflation's impact on their retirement planning — and almost one-third don’t know how to make sure their retirement savings keep up.

But this is no time to panic, Assaf says.

""The encouraging news is, rising costs might not be as big a threat to your retirement lifestyle as you may fear,"" she told FOX Business.

Funds -- ETFs in particular -- can also make you a millionaire, even though many of them never beat the market.
Since you're targeting millionaire status by retirement, you'll want a higher percentage of stock ETFs versus bond ETFs.
That growth rate should be attainable over 20-plus years in a retirement portfolio that's heavy on stock ETFs.
CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSSeven figures via ETFsYou can retire a millionaire with ETFs.","Can you retire a millionaire with ETFs alone? The simple answer is yes, you can. Here's how.

You don't have to beat the market

It's a common belief that investors get rich by picking individual stocks and beating the market. While that can be true, stock picking isn't the only path for investors to build wealth. Funds -- ETFs in particular -- can also make you a millionaire, even though many of them never beat the market.

In truth, the broader market provides enough growth potential to build a seven-figure retirement fund. Follow the four rules below to harness that market power and achieve your wealth goals without having to pick a single stock.

INFLATION-FIGHTING ETFS: HOW TO INVEST

1. Choose efficiency

Funds have administrative expenses that they pass along to shareholders. Those expenses dilute the returns of the underlying stock portfolio. If you choose cost-efficient funds, a greater portion of the ETF's earnings flow through to your bottom line.

Expense ratio is the metric you'll use to compare funds on cost efficiency. You'll see this number presented as a percentage that's some fraction of 1%, say 0.10%. A 0.10% expense ratio equates to expenses of $10 for every $10,000 you have invested.

Some index ETFs have expense ratios that are close to zero. iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, for example, both have expense ratios of 0.03%.

THIS VANGUARD ETF COULD MAKE YOU A MULTIMILLIONAIRE WITH ZERO EFFORT

If your 401(k) doesn't offer low-cost ETFs, ask your administrator if your account has a brokerage window. Or, invest in these funds in an IRA or taxable brokerage account instead.

2. Plan your asset allocation

Asset allocation is the composition of your portfolio across different asset classes, like stocks and bonds. Stocks deliver growth, with some risk, while bonds provide stability. You can mix and match the two to tailor your portfolio's risk and reward characteristics.

Since you're targeting millionaire status by retirement, you'll want a higher percentage of stock ETFs versus bond ETFs. If retirement is still decades away and you can handle some volatility, you could hold up to 90% stock funds. Start with a lower percentage if retirement is within 15 years or if stock market volatility makes you nervous.

3 BETTER WAYS TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT THAN A 401(K)

3. Invest generously and consistently

To amass seven figures with ETFs, you must invest generously and consistently -- for decades. The numbers below show monthly contributions required to get to $1 million on different timelines. Note that the monthly contributions could include your employer match.

$2,265 → 20 years

$1,518 → 25 years

$1,054 → 30 years

$748 → 35 years

$538 → 40

All scenarios assume average annual growth of 6%, which is a bit less than the stock market's long-term average after inflation. That growth rate should be attainable over 20-plus years in a retirement portfolio that's heavy on stock ETFs.

You can see that the monthly contribution gets unmanageable if you wait too long to start investing. That's your cue to kick this plan off today. Even if you're 30 years out from retirement and you can't afford to contribute $1,000 monthly, invest whatever you can today. You can raise your contribution later as your income increases.

4. Don't time the market

Whatever happens with the stock market, commit to staying invested and continuing your contributions. If you start pulling back on contributions or selling to avoid losses, you may never hit that million-dollar target.

It may sound counterintuitive, but selling to avoid losses usually lowers your returns. For example, the market drops, so you sell at a lower share price to stop the bleeding. You then wait until the market has stabilized to reinvest. At that point, you buy back your shares at higher prices than when you sold them for. Selling low and buying high creates a loss, which reduces your long-term returns.

If you stay invested when the market goes sideways, you don't have to worry about when to reinvest. You also remain well positioned to benefit when the market recovers.

Seven figures via ETFs

You can retire a millionaire with ETFs. The strategy is to ride the market's long-term growth trend. For that to work, you must choose low-cost funds, be strategic about your asset allocation, and invest consistently over time -- without getting spooked by market fluctuations.

3 SOCIAL SECURITY SECRETS FOR EVEN BIGGER CHECKS2.","Knowing when you'll quit the workforce is a crucial part of retirement planning, but few people give as much attention to where they're going to retire. Yet it's worth thinking about if you haven't already.

Where you live can drastically affect the cost of your retirement and how far your savings will go. Here's a closer look at three ways your home can affect your retirement expenses.

BEST STATES FOR RETIREMENT IN 2022: REPORT

1. Some states tax Social Security benefits

When calculating your retirement income, you may assume that all your Social Security checks will go directly into your pocket. But that's not always the case. The following 13 states tax some of their residents' Social Security benefits:

1. Colorado

2. Connecticut

3. Kansas

4. Minnesota

5. Missouri

6. Montana

7. Nebraska

8. New Mexico

9. North Dakota

10. Rhode Island

11. Utah

12. Vermont

13. West Virginia

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

But living in one of these places isn't a guarantee that you'll owe anything. Each state has its own rules, but most only take a cut of your benefits if your annual income or Social Security benefit exceeds certain thresholds.

If you live in one of the above 13 states or you intend to do so in retirement, you may want to check with the state department of taxation to learn which seniors owe benefit taxes. These rules may change between now and your retirement, so be sure to check on this every few years so you know what to expect.

If you don't want to deal with Social Security benefit taxes at all, you could consider retiring in one of the 37 states that don't tax seniors' Social Security benefits. But even if you do this, you could still owe federal taxes. The only way around these is to limit your taxable income. If that's not possible, you'll have to account for Social Security benefit taxes in your retirement plan.

3 SOCIAL SECURITY SECRETS FOR EVEN BIGGER CHECKS

2. Some places have a higher cost of living than others

Urban areas tend to have a higher cost of living than rural areas, so retirees living in cities will often have to save more to cover all their retirement expenses. Even among cities, though, there's a lot of variation in terms of cost.

If you plan to remain in your current city during retirement, you probably already have an idea of how much your expenses will be. But if you plan to move, it's a good idea to look at how the average cost of living in your chosen retirement city stacks up to the cost of living in your current city.

You should especially pay attention to the basics, like food and housing. But medical care should be high on your list, as well. People often see their healthcare expenses rise as they age, and this can take a significant bite out of your retirement savings.

THIS IS YOUR BIGGEST ENEMY WHEN SAVING FOR RETIREMENT

3. Staying put could save you money if you own your home outright

A monthly rent or mortgage payment can take up a significant portion of your budget, but it's not something all seniors have to deal with. Those who own their homes outright may find it's more affordable for them to remain where they are, rather than move elsewhere and take on a new housing payment.

Even if you owe money on your home, staying where you are could still be the right choice. This is especially true if housing costs have risen in your area since you first bought your home. If you try to move elsewhere, you might find that you're paying a lot more per month than you would have to if you remained in your current home.

But sometimes, moving could be the best decision. If you're downsizing, for example, you might end up with a more affordable monthly payment. Or if you sell your home for a sizable profit, you may be able to buy a more affordable home elsewhere and actually make a little money.

Ultimately, you have to base your decision on what you feel would make you the happiest in retirement. But once you've decided on that, make sure you've tailored your retirement budget to where you're going to be living. Things like cost of living and tax laws can change over time. So when you review your retirement plan annually, make sure you're reviewing these things, as well, to see if you need to make any adjustments."

Berkshire said Saturday that a largely unrealized $53 billion decline in the value of its investments forced it to report a loss of nearly $44 billion, or $29,754 per Class A share. That is down from $28.1 billion, or $18,488 per Class A share, a year ago.

Buffett has long said he believes Berkshire’s operating earnings are a better measure of the company’s performance because they exclude investment gains and losses, which can vary widely quarter to quarter.

By that measure, Berkshire’s earnings were up significantly to $9.28 billion, or $6,312.49 per Class A share from last year’s $6.69 billion, or $4,399.92 per Class A share.

Analysts covering Berkshire expected the company to report operating earnings per Class A share of $4,741.64.

Berkshire said its revenue grew more than 10% to $76.2 billion in the quarter as many of its businesses increased prices.

Berkshire's many companies still performed well, suggesting the overall economy is weathering the pressure from inflation and rising interest rates.

They all fell significantly during the second quarter, but rebounded during the third quarter, boosting the value of Berkshire’s portfolio since the end of the quarter.

Besides investments, Berkshire owns more than 90 companies outright. Berkshire said operating profits were up at all of its major units, including its insurance companies, major utilities and BNSF railroad.

BUFFETT'S BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY BUYS EVEN MORE OCCIDENTAL SHARES

Berkshire did report a $487 million pretax underwriting loss at Geico, which reported bigger auto claims losses because of the soaring value of vehicles and ongoing shortages of car parts.

Berkshire is often seen as a microcosm of the broader economy because its collection of manufacturing, retail, insurance, utility and service businesses touches so many different industries, and Berkshire’s profits tend to follow whatever the economy is doing.

Musk, who has more than 100 million Twitter followers, went on to challenge Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal to a ""public debate about the Twitter bot percentage.""

Twitter declined comment Saturday. The company has repeatedly disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission an estimate that fewer than 5% of user accounts are fake or spam, with a disclaimer that it could be higher. Musk waived his right to further due diligence when he signed the April merger agreement.

Lemoine was placed on leave on June 6 for talking with people outside Google about the company’s AI chatbot LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialog Applications. The system is used to create chatbots that can mimic human speech.

Lemoine had been working on the system since last fall and described it as sentient with an ability to express thoughts and feelings equivalent to a human child.

Lemoine said several of the conversations with LaMDA convinced him that the system was sentient. He said he believed it had become a person and that it should be asked for consent on the experiments Google runs on it.

FOX Business has reached out to Lemoine for comment but did not hear back before publication.

Lemoine appeared to reference his firing in a Saturday tweet, referring to a blog post he wrote in which he anticipated being fired for raising his concerns about AI ethics.

""Today I was placed on ‘paid administrative leave’ by Google in connection to an investigation of AI ethics concerns I was raising within the company,"" Lemoine wrote. ""This is frequently something which Google does in anticipation of firing someone.

Google did not respond to FOX Business’ request for comment.

In a statement to the Big Technology Podcast, Google said all employees’ concerns about the company’s work are ""extensively"" reviewed, and found Lemoine’s claims about LaMDA being sentient ""wholly unfounded.""

From the Democrats' point of view, the calculation is that if he dropped out of the ‘24 race now, his unpopularity would not be such a big factor this November, that Democrats would not be tarred with the Biden brush.

Good luck with that. The Democrats can't walk away from $5 gas that easily.

And they can't walk away from the border crisis, or the debacle in Afghanistan, or the impending recession.

And voters seem in no mood to ignore the decline of public education either.

If I'm a trading card collector, I want my trading cards.""
We're launching with comic books; all the comic books are obtained directly from Marvel and DC – we're not touching anything in a secondary market.","For the first time since 2019, the Mecca for SciFi and Fantasy enthusiasts returns to San Diego for its first in-person convention since before the coronavirus pandemic - and in anticipation of the highly-anticipated four-day event beginning July 21, the famed global sports/entertainment trading card and collectibles company Upper Deck announced its newest initiative on Comic-Con Preview Night: the launch of ‘Collect Forever.’



""Our goal is to service collectors and help them collect the way they want to collect,"" Upper Deck President Jason Masherah told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview of the revolutionary expansion - which he said moves to bridge NFTs with tangible collectibles and includes a ""very natural extension"" into comic books given its established partnership with staples like Marvel.



""We wanted to create a space where people could essentially bring any collectible into this ecosystem and allow them to trade — and what's really cool as a collector is, you could now trade a Wayne Gretzky trading card for a Spider-Man comic book,"" the Upper Deck president said, noting the company's desire to extend to other collectibles outside the trading card realm.



Masherah introduced the world to Collect Forever at the multi-genre entertainment event Wednesday, adding that initial products to be available for purchase will include pre-ordered collectibles from Marvel, DC Comics, and Funko POP.

""We're much more than people realize,"" Masherah noted. ""We're typically known as a trading card company, but we have three distinct divisions of the company here.

We make tabletop games, board games, and trading card games.""



As of Wednesday, the company will now add comic books to its repertoire.



Comic book collectors will rejoice over Collect Forever's variant cover options, which Masherah likened to opening a trading card pack.



""There's this phenomenon in the comic book world called variant covers; typically they're incentives for the comic book shops; if you buy 20 copies of a comic, you get a limited edition variant cover - and typically, the shop either has them designated for other customers, or they use them to try and make a profit in the shop,"" Masherah explained.



""We're actually randomly distributing those when people buy comics; so if you buy a $5 comic book, you have the opportunity to get a variant cover that might be worth $50 or $100. It's kind of like opening a trading card pack,"" Masherah said of the new offering.

Collect Forever, in addition to Upper Deck's e-Pack, will serve as a one-stop shop for collectors, bridging the benefits of an NFT with a true, tangible collectible and allowing consumers an opportunity to store their collectibles on an e-Pack account.



Masherah explained the setup allows collectors who may not have the physical space to store their entire collection of comic books, toys, figurines, etc., at home the ability to, instead, store them virtually (in physical vault-like storage facilities owned by Upper Deck).



He added that the expansion's objective targets not only those who lack the room to house their collectibles, but collectors who don't live in proximity to a brick and mortar:



""We also want to provide an online experience for people who maybe don't have a trading card or a comic book store close. The reality is, most cities don't have a trading card or comic book store; they [collectors] can't easily get figurines, and we want to be able to provide that solution - not only for our own products, but for all collectibles.""

Stocks in this Article MRVL MARVELL TECHNOLOGY INC. $51.26 -4.33 (-7.79%) FNKO FUNKO INC. $21.04 -0.88 (-4.01%)





The Upper Deck president assured customers that every virtual purchase is still very much tangible: ""Everything is still a physical, tangible collectible that you can have sent home at any time.""



""If I'm a comic book collector, I want my comic books. If I'm a trading card collector, I want my trading cards.""



Masherah also assured customers of the company's efforts in ensuring a safe and secure purchase.



""Everything that you buy on the site came directly from a manufacturer. We're launching with comic books; all the comic books are obtained directly from Marvel and DC – we're not touching anything in a secondary market. So customers can be assured that it's coming directly from the manufacturers,"" he told Fox News Digital.



""On top of that, we're encapsulating everything as well and marking them uncirculated so you know this was fresh out of the box. We're going to bar code and QR code all the items, and then you can essentially scan those bar codes and it will take you to an authentication site and give you the information on each particular collectible that you buy through the website.""

South Carolina State Treasurer Curtis Loftis told FOX Business that he has put banks on notice that he opposes ESG standards.","Republican state officials are readying plans to punish woke banks which push anti-fossil fuel policies and adhere to so-called environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards.

West Virginia announced last week it would bar five major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, from entering into banking contracts with the state treasurer's office or any state agency. Each of the five corporations had committed to policies limiting commercial engagement with the fossil fuel industry, which paid a whopping $769 million in taxes to West Virginia's state government.

""We're not going to pay for our own destruction, we're not going to subsidize that,"" West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore told FOX Business during an interview. ""They have weaponized our tax dollars against the very people and industry that have generated them to begin with. That is why we're pushing back against this ESG movement.""

He noted that U.S. Bancorp backed off its prohibition of fossil fuel lending and was, as a result, kept off the state's restricted list of financial institutions.

Moore's action, a first-of-its-kind response to major banks' ESG push, is likely to be the start of many similar actions nationwide. At least 15 Republican-led states, which collectively manage tens of billions of dollars in public funds, have proposed laws or policies that would similarly punish anti-fossil fuel banks over the last year, according to a FOX Business analysis.

In addition to Texas, state financial officers in Kentucky, Oklahoma, Florida, South Carolina, Arizona, Louisiana, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas and North Dakota said they would take or consider action against banks that boycott energy companies. Kentucky and Oklahoma, like Texas, are compiling lists as required by recently passed state laws.

Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., unveiled a bill Wednesday seeking to force states to allow hydraulic fracturing by tying federal funds to the method of fossil fuel extraction.

States with statewide bans on fracking would be barred from receiving any funds from the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program under Tenney's legislation which was first obtained by FOX Business. The bill, which is set to be formally introduced Friday, is intended to target Tenney's home state of New York which first banned fracking in 2014 and codified the ban in 2020.

MANCHIN-SCHUMER BILL WOULD REINSTATE TAX ON IMPORTED OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

""New York State is sitting on top of natural gas formations that could power our state with clean energy for decades,"" Tenney told FOX Business in a statement. ""Unfortunately, far-left policies in Albany and Washington have severely limited our ability to safely tap into these reserves, threatening America’s energy independence, raising prices for consumers, and killing thousands of well-paying jobs.""

""As Americans struggle with record-high costs due to the Joe Biden and Kathy Hochul’s energy and economic illiteracy, it is time we take actions to reverse this disaster and restore our nation’s energy independence,"" she continued. ""Americans need clean energy at lower costs now, and delivering on this commitment can and should start right here in New York.""

The EECBG program, which is overseen by the Department of Energy, provides state and local governments grants to reduce fossil fuel emissions, reduce energy use and improve energy efficiency across various sectors. The program was appropriated $550 million under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which President Biden signed in November.

Tenney's office said the program is a ""perfect fit for being the enforcement mechanism of the law"" in a one-page summary of the bill shared with FOX Business.

GOP HAMMERS BIDEN FOR ALLOWING EMERGENCY OIL RESERVES TO GO TO CHINA: 'COMPROMISING OUR ENERGY SECURITY'

Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., issued a statewide ban on fracking in 2014 and, in 2020, introduced a bill codifying the ban into state law. The New York state legislature approved the bill as part of the fiscal year 2021 budget.

""New York's leadership on hydraulic fracturing protects the environment, our drinking water, and our health,"" Cuomo tweeted after he introduced the permanent ban in January 2020. ""We must make the ban permanent.""

New York is a net importer of natural gas, most which comes via pipeline from Pennsylvania, even though the Marcellus Shale, the nation's most prolific natural gas formation, runs through the western part of the state, according to the Energy Information Administration. In 2021, natural gas generated more than 45% of the New York's electricity, making it the largest source of statewide power by far.

Vermont, Washington and Maryland have also banned fracking. However, Vermont has no fossil energy reserves while Washington and Maryland have few reserves of their own.

The proposal, included in a $433 billion tax and climate bill, would reinstate a 16.4 cents-per-barrel tax on crude oil imports and taxes on imported petroleum products. President Biden has tried three times to reinstate the tax but has been unsuccessful thus far, according to a Fox News analysis.

The Washington-based conservative group Americans for Tax Reform says the tax ""will be paid by consumers in the form of higher gas and energy costs,"" Bloomberg reported.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced an agreement last week on legislation boosting taxes on huge corporations and wealthy individuals, bolstering fossil fuels and climate change efforts and curbing pharmaceutical prices. Overall, it would raise $739 billion over 10 years in revenue and spend $433 billion, leaving over $300 billion to modestly reduce federal deficits. But a Penn Wharton analysis found that the bill would probably increase inflation slightly for its first two years, before possibly reducing inflation later.

BIDEN'S RADICAL SEC AGENDA USES AGENCY TO MANDATE CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION

The tax on imported oil and petroleum products would seemingly break President Biden’s pledge that tax hikes will affect only those Americans earning $400,000 or more per year. Manchin has said the Democratic package honors that pledge. Taxes on oil and petroleum products are usually passed on to consumers in the form of higher energy prices. Energy prices have already broken records during Biden's presidency, and inflation has hit its highest rate in decades.

Manchin told ""The Faulkner Focus"" on Tuesday that an Inflation Reduction Act tax analysis which suggested the bill would raise taxes on nearly all Americans had been ""written by my friends on the Republican"" committee and not done by the whole Joint Committee on Taxation.

FOX Business reached out to JCT Chief of Staff Thomas A. Barthold who said the tax analysis was prepared ""by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.""

""The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation is a nonpartisan staff serving both sides of the Hill and both sides of the aisle. There is not a Republican staff. There is not a Democratic staff,"" he said.

A spokesperson for Manchin told FOX Business that Republicans on the Committee ""released a partial analysis of one portion of the bill to advance a partisan agenda that does not accurately reflect the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act on average Americans.""

SOARING INFLATION DRIVES MORE AMERICANS TO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK DESPITE 5.1% INCREASE IN WAGES

Manchin is one of Congress' most conservative and contrarian Democrats. He has spent over a year forcing his party to trim its economic proposals, citing inflation fears starkly, and his compromise with Schumer last week shocked colleagues who'd given up hope that he would agree to such a wide-ranging measure.

Manchin has asserted the bill's imposition of a 15% minimum tax on corporations earning over $1 billion annually is not a tax increase. He says it closes loopholes such companies use to escape paying the current 21% corporate tax.

Republicans mocked that reasoning and said its tax boosts would weaken the economy and kill jobs. They cited a report from Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that said about half of the corporate minimum tax would hit manufacturing firms.

""So in the middle of a supply chain crisis, Democrats want huge job-killing tax hikes that will disproportionately crush American manufacturing and manufacturing jobs,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Schumer said he expected votes to begin this week in the Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris could cast the tie-breaking vote to assure its passage. The narrowly divided House has left town for an August recess, but Democratic leaders have said they would bring lawmakers back for a vote, perhaps next week.

Sotheby’s sale amounted to the house’s third-largest single sale total ever.

Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa put the untitled 1982 painting up for sale, and an Asian telephone bidder represented by a Phillips representative based in Taipei won it after a four-minute competition.

The sale didn’t break the $110.5 million record for a Basquiat, held by an untitled blue work from 1982 that Maezawa won in 2017. Still, the red example sold by Phillips reaped a tidy profit for Maezawa, the mogul behind the e-commerce site Zozotown, who bought the red Basquiat six years earlier for $57.3 million. That represents a 48% return for the collector.

The Phillips auction continued the art market’s hot streak over two weeks of sales that has seen record prices for works like the ""Shot Sage Blue Marilyn"" and an iconic Man Ray photograph. Buoyed by the art market’s recent strength and Basquiat’s international appeal, Phillips headed into the sale with a measure of confidence, giving the work featuring a devilish figure a $70 million estimate.

The house hedged its bet, signing up an outside investor ahead of the sale to pledge to bid an undisclosed sum for it if no one else stepped up in the moment, guaranteeing the Basquiat would be sold.

PICASSO PAINTING FETCHES $67.5M AT AUCTION

Such financial mechanisms, called third-party guarantors, are increasingly common in the auction industry and in several cases helped larger rival Sotheby’s $409 million modern-art sale the night before. Sotheby’s sale amounted to the house’s third-largest single sale total ever. But its success hinged in part on selling several pieces by Pablo Picasso and others to guarantors who only had to place single bids to win.

Market watchers pay attention to the number of bidders who compete for works at the priciest levels because thin bidding can hint at potential cracks in collector confidence. On Wednesday, two bidders vied for the Basquiat—so that could indicate collectors still crave his work at a broad level. The work’s wall-spanning size may also have played a role in its appeal.

MARILYN MONROE'S DRESSES FROM POPULAR MOVIES UP FOR AUCTION

Increasingly, millennial collectors are starting to champion a fresh slate of artists born long after Basquiat died in 1988. These include Anna Weyant, whose 2021 ""Buffet II"" sold to a telephone bidder in Hong Kong for $730,800 over its $150,000 high estimate. Another auction newcomer this season, María Berrío’s 2013 ""Burrow of the Yellow,"" also sold for $998,000 over its estimate of $400,000 to $600,000.

The bill also imposes a 15% minimum tax on corporations based on profits they publicly report on their financial statements to shareholders.
The minimum book tax would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income.
The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.","The sweeping climate, health care and tax bill that Senate Democrats passed Sunday includes one of the biggest tax hikes in decades, including a new levy for corporations that repurchase their own stock.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which passed along party lines with Democrats employing the budget reconciliation process, would raise an estimated $739 billion over the next decade, with the revenues going toward initiatives designed to combat climate change and curb pharmaceutical prices, as well as efforts to reduce the nation's $30 trillion debt.

It includes about $433 billion in new spending, while roughly $300 billion of the new revenue raised would go toward paying down the nation's deficit.

Some of the main revenue raisers stem from new levies on wealthy businesses, including a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases that is poised to take effect in 2023. Democrats, who estimated this new levy will raise about $74 billion over the next decade, are hoping to slow companies' tendency to buy back their own stock from investors with the tax.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT: WHAT TAX HIKES ARE IN THE BILL?

Companies have been allowed to buy their own shares since 1982, and the practice has since become commonplace on Wall Street. In 2019, stock buybacks hit a record $1 trillion, according to the SEC. Buybacks already hit a record $281 billion in the first three months of 2022, according to S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt. Although they were down 17.4% in the second quarter.

""I hate stock buybacks,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""I think they are one of the most self-serving things that corporate America does.""

The bill also imposes a 15% minimum tax on corporations based on profits they publicly report on their financial statements to shareholders. The minimum book tax would only apply to companies that reported more than $1 billion in income. Democrats said the levy would affect around 200 of the country's largest corporations with profits exceeding $1 billion and that pay less than the current 21% rate for businesses.

Experts expect the two taxes to drag on 2023 earnings, with Goldman Sachs forecasting a 1.5% decline per share of S&P 500 companies. The earnings decreases are expected to hit industries like health care and IT because of the low effective tax rate.

UBS strategists led by Solita Marcelli, meanwhile, projected the new taxes would have a ""very minimal 1% drag on S&P 500 earnings per share, although some companies will be more affected than others.""

Distribution by California's Alameda County Community Food Bank has risen this summer and Texas' Houston Food Bank now gives out an average of 610,000 pounds.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSA Feeding America food bank survey earlier this year showed that 80% of food banks were reporting either an increase or steady demand for emergency food services.","Inflation has been a ""concern"" for Los Angeles Regional Food Bank CEO Michael Flood, who stressed Tuesday that the price hikes for necessities, including food and gas, have ""put a lot of pressure"" on household budgets.

He also noted that the inflationary pressures have led to soaring demand at food banks.

""We’re worried,"" Flood told ""Varney & Co."" on Tuesday.

""We rely mostly on donated food from farmers, retailers, manufacturers and then we supplement that with food purchases and so being a nonprofit, it’s a matter of what resources are coming in, in terms of the amount of food, the amount of funding to supplement that food, so it’s a concern right now as we look between now and the end of the year, especially because of inflation.""

FOOD BANKS ARE SERVING MORE PEOPLE AGAIN AS INFLATION SQUEEZES BUDGETS

""It’s really put a lot of pressure on families and household budgets and it’s leading a lot of people needing to seek food assistance,"" he stressed.

Flood provided the insight the day before July’s inflation data will be released.

Last month, the Labor Department revealed that inflation accelerated more than expected to a new four-decade high in June, exacerbating a financial strain for millions of Americans.

The department said the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 9.1% in June from a year ago. Prices jumped 1.3% in the one-month period from May. Those figures were both far higher than the 8.8% headline figure and 1% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists.

The data marked the fastest pace of inflation since December 1981.

Price increases were extensive with energy prices rising 7.5% in June from the previous month and 41.6% compared to the same time last year. Gasoline, on average, costs 59.9% more than it did one year ago and 11.2% more than it did in May. The food index, meanwhile, climbed 1% in June, as consumers paid more for items like cereal, chicken, milk, and fresh vegetables.

Shelter costs – which account for roughly one-third of the CPI – sped up again in June, climbing 0.6%, matching an 18-year-high set in May. On an annual basis, shelter costs have climbed 5.6%, the fastest since February 1991.

Rent costs also surged in June, jumping 0.8% over the month, the largest monthly increase since April 1986. Rising rents are a concerning development because higher housing costs most directly and acutely affect household budgets.

Flood pointed out the shift in the trend he has been noticing as it pertains to the demographic visiting food banks.

He noted that during the pandemic ""we had so many people who were furloughed or lost their jobs and didn’t have employment.""

""Now the employment picture has improved when you compare it to 2020 and 2021, so now we’re seeing a lot of people who are working, sometimes two jobs, in the family or household, sometimes more,"" Flood said.

He stressed that even so, ""the high prices of food, of fuel, and housing in a place like Los Angeles and other metro areas puts a lot of pressure on budgets.""

With inflation at 40-year highs, many Americans are looking for aid for the first time and food banks are struggling to meet demand.

Charitable food distribution has exceeded any amounts given out before the COVID-19 pandemic, although there was some relief last year.

Distribution by California's Alameda County Community Food Bank has risen this summer and Texas' Houston Food Bank now gives out an average of 610,000 pounds.

In Southern California, the Los Angeles bank gave away around 30 million pounds of food during the first three months of this year, far more than the 22 million pounds passed out during the first quarter of 2020.

A spokesperson said that was up from 500,000 daily pounds before the pandemic.

Unplanned disruptions at LNG plants in the United States, Nigeria and Australia have wrong-footed traders, including BP and Shell, forcing them to pay inflated costs for alternative supplies.

In a market already struggling to meet global demand for natural gas after Russia sharply reduced pipeline supplies into Europe, the lost LNG cargoes which can be transported by ship, have pushed global prices sharply higher in recent months.

BP took a more than $500 million hit to replace LNG cargoes lost after a sudden shutdown of the Freeport LNG plant in Texas in June, industry sources told Reuters.

BREWERIES SCRAMBLE FOR CO2 AMID SHORTAGE: 'A SCARY SITUATION'

Freeport, the second-biggest U.S. LNG export plant, supplies BP with 4 million tonnes per year from a total portfolio of 18 million tonnes, BP Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss told Reuters.

""Freeport does create an impact in the quarter and we've provided for that for the year,"" Auchincloss said. The company had deducted the expected costs from its second-quarter profit, but Auchincloss did not specify costs.

A BP spokesperson declined to comment on the loss figure.

France's TotalEnergies also said it would replace eight cargoes of LNG it was scheduled to receive from Freeport by buying in the spot market in the third quarter of the year. It was unclear how much the replacement cargoes would cost TotalEnergies.

Freeport produces 15 million tonnes of LNG per year.

RUSSIA BANS INVESTORS FROM 'UNFRIENDLY COUNTRIES' FROM SELLING SHARES IN RUSSIAN ENERGY OR BANKING

Traders typically sign long-term offtake agreements with LNG producers and agree on separate deals to supply consumers with cargoes from their global portfolios. It's rare to use plant outages to justify not supplying consumers through what is known as force majeure.

Shell , the world's largest LNG trader with a 20% market share, cut its LNG production volumes in the second quarter by 4%, mainly due to supply losses from the Sakhalin-2 plant in Russia, where it exited operations after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February.

The company continues to receive LNG cargoes under existing long-term deals with Sakhalin-2, a company spokesperson said.

But the future of the contracts is shrouded in uncertainty after Russia gave foreign investors in the project one month to claim their stakes in a new entity that will replace the existing one. Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said it was ""highly unlikely"" Shell would join the new entity.

The supply loss impacted Shell's second-quarter profit by around $200 million in the quarter, according to estimates by industry sources. Shell declined to comment on the figure.

CRUDE OIL PRICES RISE AS RUSSIA SUSPENDS EXPORTS TO EUROPE THROUGH PIPELINE

On top of that, Shell and its partners lost LNG production at the giant Prelude floating LNG off the western coast of Australia after shutting it down amid a pay dispute.

Nigeria's huge LNG export terminal on Bonny Island has also seen output declines in recent months as a result of a shortfall in natural gas supplies due to rampant theft and sabotage to oil and gas pipelines.

The money lost is dwarfed by enormous profits both BP and Shell recorded this year on the back of soaring refining margins and high oil and gas prices.

But lower availability of LNG has pushed benchmark prices to record highs as Europe sought to ramp up imports rapidly to replace lost Russian pipeline natural gas.

At current prices, an average cargo of LNG would cost around $100 million in the spot market.

European LNG imports from January to July surpassed a record 100 billion cubic metres (bcm), or 75 million tonnes (Mt), almost reaching the level observed through the entire 2021, according to Nnenna Amobi, senior LNG analyst at Refinitiv.

Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

As a parent, you have two main options to help pay for your child’s college expenses: Parent PLUS Loans and private student loans .

The federal government offers Parent PLUS Loans and they come with unique benefits. Private loans come from private lenders, and they may have lower interest rates if you have good credit.

In this article, we’ll go over the main differences between the two types of loans to help you figure out which may be right for you.



Credible lets you compare private student loan rates from multiple lenders, all in one place.

Parent PLUS Loans vs. private parent loans

Both Parent PLUS Loans and private parent loans give you the opportunity to borrow money for your child’s higher education expenses. But they differ significantly in how interest rates are set and how you’ll repay them.

Parent PLUS Loans

The U.S. Department of Education offers Parent PLUS Loans, which are more formally known as Direct PLUS Loans. Graduate or professional students can take these loans out, as well as parents of undergraduate students.

You generally apply for these loans online through the StudentAid.gov website . In most cases, you won’t qualify if you have an adverse credit history, like a bankruptcy or foreclosure in the last five years or a history of late or missed payments.

Parent PLUS Loans have a fixed interest rate set by the federal government, which is currently 7.54%. That means the interest rate won’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You’re able to borrow up to the full cost of attendance, as determined by your child’s school, minus any other financial aid the student receives. When you take out the loan, you’ll also pay a fee of 4.228% of the loan amount. To pay the fee, the government will deduct a portion of the funds from each loan payout.

Private parent loans

Private parent student loans have no standard requirements. Instead, individual lenders set their own qualifications, interest rates, and repayment terms. But in general, lenders determine the interest rate based on your credit score. People with higher credit scores will qualify for lower rates, while people with poor credit will get higher rates, if they qualify.

You may find private parent loans with fixed or variable rates. Variable-rate loans typically begin with a lower APR, but this rate can rise over time. Fixed-rate loans don’t change for as long as you have the loan.

You usually have the option to make full principal and interest payments while your child is in school, or you can make interest-only payments to keep the interest from building up. Most private parent loans must be repaid within 15 years, though loan terms may be shorter depending on the lender.

The best private parent loans feature zero loan fees. Just like with Parent PLUS Loans, you’re solely responsible for repaying a private parent loan.

Cosigned student loans

A third option for helping your child pay for their college education is by cosigning their student loan. When you do this, your child is the primary borrower on the loan but you’re agreeing to be responsible for repaying the loan if your child defaults.

You may consider cosigning a private student loan with your child. In many cases, students aren’t able to qualify for a loan on their own since they may have little or no credit history. By cosigning, lenders take your credit into account as well. Any missed payments will hurt both your credit and your child’s. Many lenders offer a cosigner release option, which allows you to remove yourself from the loan once your child has made a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments.

A cosigner usually isn’t required on federal student loans.

When does it make sense to take out a Parent PLUS Loan?

A Parent PLUS Loan may make the most sense if you have fair credit. With these federal loans, the interest rate is the same no matter your credit score. If you don’t have any major credit problems, but your score simply isn’t the best, you may get a lower rate on a Parent PLUS Loan than you would on a private loan.

A Parent PLUS Loan may also be the best choice if you want to take advantage of one of the unique repayment plans the government offers:

Standard Repayment Plan — This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years.

This is the default repayment plan, where you repay the loan in equal monthly payments for 10 years. Extended Repayment Plan — This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan.

This plan offers terms of up to 25 years — significantly longer than most private loans. This can give you a lower monthly payment than you’d have with a shorter loan. Graduated Repayment Plan — This plan can help if you expect to have a higher income in the future. Your payments start low, but rise over time. Ideally, your income would grow along with your payment. You also have up to 10 years to repay your loan under this plan.

If your payments are still too high, you may have the option to combine all the Parent PLUS Loans you have into a federal Direct Consolidation Loan, which gives you the option of enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. With these plans, your monthly payment is capped at a certain percentage of your discretionary income. This can be a great option if your discretionary income is relatively low.

When does it make sense to take out a private parent student loan?

If your child has exhausted all their scholarship, grant, and federal loan options, and if you have excellent credit, a private parent student loan may make the most sense. You’ll likely be able to qualify for a lower rate than what you’d receive with a Parent PLUS Loan, saving you money in interest.

Private loans may also make sense if you’d like to choose a variable interest rate. This option gives you a lower initial rate, though it can rise over time. If you expect to pay off the loan quickly, though, you may be able to keep the lower interest rate and pay off the loan before it rises."

Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity would decline at a 4.7% rate in the April-June period.

Large shifts in the composition of the U.S. workforce in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have made it harder to measure underlying productivity growth, which some economists put at about 1.0% or less, making the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation more difficult.

Stocks in this Article ZG ZILLOW GROUP INC. $36.33 -2.65 (-6.80%)

The firm’s termination of its tech-enabled home-flipping business, known as ""iBuying,"" follows Zillow’s announcement about two weeks ago that it was halting all new home purchases for the rest of the year. At the time, Zillow pointed to labor and supply shortages for its inability to renovate and flip houses fast enough.

In a statement Tuesday, Chief Executive Rich Barton said Zillow had failed to predict the pace of home-price appreciation accurately, marking an end to a venture the company once said could generate $20 billion a year. Instead, the company said it now plans to cut 25% of its workforce.

ZILLOW STOCK DROPS AS COMPANY PUTS HOMEBUYING ON HOLD

""We’ve determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated and continuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility,"" Barton said.

Zillow and other tech-powered house flippers, known as iBuyers, purchase homes, renovate them and then try to sell them quickly, making money on transaction fees and home-price appreciation. Zillow used an algorithm to make home price estimates, called the ""Zestimate,"" and determine what it would pay home sellers.

Ultralow mortgage-interest rates and a need for more space to work from home have driven robust home-buying demand in the past year and a half. Prices have climbed sharply in almost every corner of the U.S.

""It feels like this would be a hard time to lose money buying and selling houses,"" said Benjamin Keys, professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ""This is a time frame where prices have gone up in a lot of places, dramatically.""

In recent months, sky-high prices have forced out some buyers, and the market has showed signs of cooling off, as many economists expected. The median existing-home sales price rose 13.3% in September from a year earlier—still unusually robust, though down from 23.6% year-over-year price growth in May, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Even this gradual tapering in price growth flummoxed Zillow’s algorithm, leading the company to pull the plug on the venture.

ZILLOW RIDES BOOMING REAL ESTATE MARKET TO 70% REVENUE GROWTH

Zillow’s class C share price was down 10% on Tuesday, falling before the company announced after the market closed that it would end home flipping. Shares continued to slide in after-hours trading.

The move represents a big hit to Zillow’s top line. Home-flipping was the company’s largest source of revenue, but it has never turned a profit.

Zillow, which released earnings Tuesday, said its home-flipping business, Zillow Offers, lost $381 million last quarter, as measured by adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That resulted in a combined adjusted Ebitda loss of $169 million across all of Zillow.

Zillow has an inventory of about 9,800 homes across the United States that it is currently shopping to investors. Additionally, there are another 8,200 homes in contract it has agreed to buy. The company expects to lose somewhere between 5% and 7% on these homes, the company said.

Starting in the summer, competitors such as OpenDoor and Offerpad began to pull back from home purchases in one of the biggest home-flipping markets, Phoenix, as the red-hot pandemic market began to cool.

But Zillow accelerated, according to an analysis of sales records by real-estate tech researcher Mike DelPrete, scholar-in-residence at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Zillow also paid significantly more than those competitors for each home it purchased, buying homes priced $65,000 above the median on average, according to DelPrete’s analysis.

By October, the company had listed 250 Phoenix homes at a median-price discount of 6.2% below what it had paid for them. DelPrete called Zillow’s price blunder a catastrophic failure.

A wider look at Zillow’s national performance by analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets found it had listed 66% of homes at prices below what it had paid for them, with an average discount of 4.5%.

""The fact that Zillow can’t make it work shouldn’t be the final death knell for iBuying,"" DelPrete said. ""The other companies are making improvements, and Zillow’s not. They’re still losing lots of money.""

Zillow said it expects that the wind-down of its home-flipping outfit will take several quarters."

It was previously owned by a trust connected to Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub, records show. Mr. Azria and his wife, Florence Azria, bought it for $41 million in 2013, records show.

Mr. Azria said it took him four years to completely renovate the property. ""I’m proud someone wants to pay this kind of price for something I created,"" he said, declining to name the buyer.

The main house is roughly 10,000 square feet, he said, and the property has a cinema, a spa and two guesthouses.

Mr. Azria said he decided to sell because he is working on another project: a circa 1927 Spanish-style house in Bel-Air. ""I’m the kind of person who likes to move on and do something different,"" he said.

FOX Business has learned that Bakish once again won’t be attending the investment bank’s annual ""summer camp for billionaires"" in Sun Valley, Idaho where the rich and famous in the world of the media and finance think big thoughts and at times lay the groundwork for potential big deals.

The event officially begins Tuesday, but the top media executives began flying into the tiny hamlet 155 miles east of Boise on Monday. The resort area will for a week house more billionaires than possibly anywhere in the country. This year’s event will feature some controversial figures in media and tech such as former Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos who just days ago stepped down from e-commerce giant Amazon amid intense regulatory pressure.

'GREASE,' 'GODFATHER' TO RETURN ON PARAMOUNT+ AS VIACOMCBS MOUNTS STREAMING CHALLENGE

The Bakish-Allen & Co. contretemps stem back to 2017 when Bakish butted heads with bankers at the firm over Viacom’s planned acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive. Bakish was CEO of the then standalone Viacom. Discovery ultimately won the bidding war for the $12 billion takeover, but Bakish complained to his board about Allen’s work on the deal and banished them from further assignments. Since then Bakish hasn’t attended the high-profile conference. His last appearance came in 2017.

This year's apparent snub is more glaring given Bakish’s clout in the media business. In 2019 Bakish was named head of the combined ViacomCBS that is controlled by the Redstone family’s parent company National Amusements, thus making him one of the most powerful executives in media.

Bakish’s standing, particularly among investment bankers, could grow even more if, as rumored, he shops ViacomCBS to suitors. Such a possibility makes his absence all the more conspicuous.

A spokesman for ViacomCBS had no comment and a spokesperson from Allen & Co. could not be reached.

The 2021 event comes after a one-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As in past years, tech, media, and finance royalty are on the attendee list such as Bakish’s boss, Shari Redstone, president of National Amusements.

Investment bankers say Redstone will be shopping for deals at the conference including a possible Comcast merger, which would face significant antitrust hurdles since such a deal would have the companies combining rival broadcast networks CBS and NBC, the latter of which is owned by Comcast. Currently Federal Communications Commission rules ""prohibit a merger between any two of the big four broadcast television networks.""

One former mainstay attendee who will not be part of the festivities is former CBS chief Les Moonves who was ousted from the company in 2018 amid sexual harassment allegations. Redstone butted heads with Moonves who resisted her plan to merge both Viacom and CBS, which had been separate units controlled by Redstone’s late father, Sumner Redstone who passed away in August 2020.

When Shari Redstone combined the two companies, she appointed Bakish CEO of ViacomCBS which now controls some of the most well-known brands in media such as Paramount Pictures, CBS News, Comedy Central and MTV.

WINNERS & LOSERS IN DISCOVERY'S MARRIAGE WITH AT&T'S WARNERMEDIA

Other attendees of the event will be David Zaslav, newly anointed CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery which recently spun out of AT&T in one of the most high-profile tie-ups of the year. Bezos, who relinquished his position as Amazon CEO on Monday to Andy Jassy. Both are expected to attend while they face serious pressures from regulators in the Biden administration who want to break up the company on the grounds that it’s a monopoly.

Amazon has been on the deal-making hunt as well recently with its acquisition of MGM Studios for $8.5 billion. Meanwhile, investors have been speculating that Amazon will split its stock when Bezos steps down to get retail investors interested in its shares which closed Friday at a whopping $3,510.

The e-commerce giant's stock has been pretty stagnant over the past year, only posting 8% returns year-to-date. Investors believe a stock split will help drive the stock price higher.

Aside from Bezos, other big names in attendance include Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Netflix’s Reed Hastings, Comcast’s Brian Roberts and WarnerMedia’s Chief Executive, Jason Kilar. Bill Gates is also said to be on the list following a tumultuous year for the Microsoft founder including a divorce and rumored ties with the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein.

Gates also stepped down from Microsoft’s board in March of 2020 amid an investigation that he had an affair years ago with a Microsoft employee. A spokesperson for Gates said the decision to step down from the board was unrelated to the affair, which ended amicably.

Deal talk already circulating at Sun Valley ranges from mega-media deals to smaller streaming takeovers. Aside from finding a possible suitor for ViacomCBS, Lionsgate, the independent movie and TV studio, has long been said to be an acquisition target. John Feltheimer, CEO of Lionsgate, will be one of the big names in attendance. Also reportedly being shopped around is NFL Network and possible suitors could include Fox Corp, the parent company of FOX Business Network, bankers say.

Another big theme investors are watching is the rise in popularity of the video gaming space. Since the start of the pandemic, the video gaming industry has exploded, now worth more than $180 billion. Heads of gaming companies like Activision Blizzard Entertainment and Epic Games are expected to be in attendance, possibly looking to strike up deals of their own."

The dispute involves around 5,000 parking spaces the city and bondholders agreed to give the Yankees as part of the development project – a complex, multi-year effort to bring economic growth to the poor South Bronx neighborhood Yankee Stadium calls home.

The development included a new stadium for New York City’s professional soccer team, New York City F.C., a hotel and retail stores on grounds that currently house parking lots and garages for Yankee games that the city is mandated to provide under a 2007 agreement with the team. It would be financed with private money arranged by a consortium that includes a housing developer and the owners of the soccer team.

BITCOIN, CRYPTO IN MLB NO LONGER OUT OF LEFT FIELD

Bonds issued in 2007 to build the parking facilities have fallen into default in recent years, while the parking garages owe the city millions of dollars in back taxes. The consortium also agreed to pay $50 million to restructure the defaulted debt.

For years, city officials and bondholders have said they were eager to find a solution to the Yankee parking imbroglio and until last week, all indications were that they had one.

But Yankee officials say the city and bondholders have reneged on a key piece of the deal that has put the entire project on hold indefinitely and possibly forever. That deal involved a guarantee of first-class parking for its fans even as the team agreed to reduce the city’s initial 9,000 plus parking space commitment.

A term sheet providing details of the agreement between bondholders, the city’s Economic Development Corporation (EDC) and the Yankees were reviewed by FOX Business.

""I’m very disappointed,"" said Yankee President Randy Levine, a former prosecutor and top city official under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani who was the architect of the redevelopment proposal. ""This would have gone a long way to salvaging the bonds plus we were going to spend a billion dollars in private money to revitalize this area that would produce thousands of good paying jobs.""

Levine added: ""The deal broke down over the bondholders and the city refusing to do what they agreed to do in the bond offerings and in the terms sheets.""

A spokeswoman for New York City's EDC said it was the Yankees who were backing out of promises made to get the deal done. She would not elaborate.

In a statement, EDC President Rachel Loeb said, ""After years of negotiations with the New York Yankees and other parties, we are disappointed they will not commit to promises already made to the city and the community and attempted to change key terms of the deal only days before a community board vote.""

A spokeswoman for Nuveen told Fox Business: ""Nuveen remains committed to the transaction set forth in the term sheet and looks forward to a continued strong relationship with the Yankees and the City.""

MLB OPENING DAY: GEORGE STEINBRENNER IV TALKS YANKEES BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS AMID COVID

The blowup of the agreement could have significant political repercussions for the next mayor of New York City, who will need to make economic redevelopment a top priority following the COVID-19 pandemic that saw businesses close amid strict city-wide lockdowns.

Bill de Blasio, the current mayor, is leaving office next year under mandated term limits. It’s expected that the winner of the recent Democratic primary either Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams or former New York City Sanitation Commissioner Kathyrn Garcia, will become the next mayor in the heavily Democratic city. Both are locked in a tight race and votes are still being counted.

The controversy surrounding parking for the Yankees has been a long-running problem that began with the construction of the new Yankee Stadium in 2006. Under a deal with the city, the Yankees are guaranteed 9,127 spaces by a non-profit that runs the garages, Bronx Parking Development Corp., documents show. Starting in 2007, the company issued more than $200 million in debt to construct garages and make other renovations to maintain ""first-class"" parking facilities for Yankee fans.

But the garages have fallen into disrepair and are anything but first-class these days. Many fans now take nearby suburban trains and city subways to travel to Yankee Stadium. The parking bonds have been in default for years and trade at distressed levels.

Management of the Yankees led by Levine, came up with a possible solution in 2018. Since the Yankees are part owners of NYCFC – a franchise with Major League Soccer – with the Abu Dhabi royal family, Levine cobbled together a proposal to finance the soccer stadium with private money on spaces now occupied by the Yankees parking. To get community buy-in, the Yankees teamed up with a developer to provide low-income housing, a new school and other amenities to the neighborhood.

The Yankees agreed to give up their rights to 9,127 spaces for something closer to 5,611 as long as the parking lot was maintained, the document shows. Bondholders' debt would be restructured as part of a new company.

Nuveen, which holds most of the bonds, would be the primary beneficiary of the $50 million payment.

The $1 billion project was expected to create thousands of jobs for a neighborhood that routinely ranks as among the nation’s poorest. All parties signed off on the term sheet which described the city’s and the bondholder's commitments to provide the roughly 5,000 parking spaces for the Yankees. The neighborhood’s community board was expected to vote on the measure this month.

But the Yankees say last week the deal was upended when the city’s EDC – the lead city agency handling the deal – and Nuveen balked at a parking space guarantee even at the reduced numbers that the Yankees wanted in the official contracts of the redevelopment.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

Both are said to fear that such specific guarantees could open the entities to future litigation and that specific ""third-party beneficiary rights"" were never part of any deal. Yankees officials counter that all they were doing was codifying guarantees in the earlier agreement, and in the term sheet, albeit at a lower number of spaces.

City Economic Development officials tell FOX Business that they are still hopeful a deal can be worked out that satisfies both parties and that the community board can vote on the project sometime in the Fall.

But according to Levine, it appears the two sides are deadlocked over the semantics of what the city and the bondholders consider a guarantee. ""I tried to explain to them that the company emerging out of bankruptcy should guarantee these spots because that’s what the bond issuance was for—providing parking for Yankee Stadium and the community,"" Levine said. ""It made no sense to us why the city and the bondholders didn’t want to guarantee these spots. They just don’t want to guarantee what they agreed to in the past and that's provide Yankee fans and the community with parking."""

And the answer they’re getting is a resounding ""yes.""

FOX Business has learned that top c-suite officials from the big banks have been setting up meetings with the relatively new chairman of the SEC in recent weeks to get a better idea of his agenda as head of Wall Street’s top cop.

Gensler was nominated by Democratic President Biden for the post and was confirmed by the Senate in April. People who have met with him say he hasn't yet fully moved into his office at the commission's Washington, DC headquarters. They say he is still largely working from his home in nearby Baltimore.

FEDS ACCELERATING CRYPTO WORLD CRACKDOWN

From his home office, however, Gensler is plotting to be a ""transformational"" SEC chair, according to Wall Street executives who know him. His top priority, he has signaled to these people: significant changes in what corporations must disclose to the public that reflect certain political, environmental and social goals an increasing number of investors are demanding.

Gensler is also telling executives that he will not ignore the traditional parts of his job and will be looking to enhance protections for small investors who have flooded the market in recent years, embracing risky financial products on a scale not seen since the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.

""He's worried about small investors getting ripped off, but the highest priority will be the new disclosure rules that appeal to the environment and issues like that,"" said one c-suite executive who asked not to be named.

An SEC spokesman had no comment.

Gensler, well-known and mostly well regarded among the Wall Street elite given his long years as a banker at the prestigious investment house Goldman Sachs and later while serving in various government finance-related roles including chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under former President Obama.

SEC PICKS AS CORPORATE REGULATOR A PROFESSOR WHO CRITICIZED STARTUP ‘UNICORNS’

His politics have transformed over the years from a left-of-center liberal on financial issues to someone who now embraces progressive edicts from the likes of Democratic Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fierce critic of corporate America. Wall Street executives say Gensler is so close to Warren he often confers with her on policy issues. A spokesman for Warren didn't return a call for comment.

Gensler's political beliefs are said to be at the center of his new – and according to some observers radical agenda – as SEC chair. He wants to impose new disclosure rules sometime before the end of the year that will force companies to go beyond alerting investors about financial issues that can materially impact their holdings. That will mean corporations will have to disclose issues about their carbon footprint, board-room diversity and other non-financial issues. It's unclear what exactly Gensler will be asking in terms of these new disclosures, but Wall Street executives say he is telling people he and his staff will provide details by the fall.

The disclosures will certainly draw criticism from some corporate executives and GOP politicians who believe Gensler is overstepping his role as a regulator of markets by embracing progressive political issues.

But Gensler appears undeterred. ""He is really serious about this stuff that probably comes right from Elizabeth Warren’s office,"" said one attorney who deals with major corporations on their dealings with the SEC. The attorney said Gensler will pass the rules through a party-line vote since Democrats outnumber Republican commissioners 3-to-2.

Other issues Gensler will focus on are those he believes involve more typical Wall Street abuse of small investors. He's said to be worried that there's not enough disclosure when retail investors buy shares of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies or SPACs. This is a new way a company can go public by being acquired by a shell company that buys several different ventures. Gensler is worried that small investors who buy shares at initial public offering are getting crushed with fees that aren't levied on big investors who sponsored the product.

SEC MULLS GAMESTOP, AMC ‘GAMIFICATION’ CRACKDOWN WITH REGULATORY LAYER

One particular concern in the SPAC space for Gensler is the so-called celebrity SPAC where movie stars and professional athletes lend their names to the SPAC even though they have no investment expertise, these people add.

Also on his list, as previously reported by FOX Business, the issues of payment for order flow and the gamification of trading. Payment for order flow is the system that allows small investors to trade for free or at a low cost through discount brokerages. Brokers sell their order flow, or buy and sell orders, to other financial firms to match the orders. The financial firms make money on the bid-and-ask spread and by handling so many trades even fractions of a penny could add up to enormous profits.

The SEC chairman is worried the system gives financial firms matching the orders--like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial--an unfair information advantage in the markets. One option he has discussed: Forcing discount brokers to send more of their trades to public exchanges where there is more transparency.

Gensler appears to be still grappling with how to regulate the so-called gamification of trading, where discount brokers appear to lure unsophisticated investors to their platform through gimmicks and incentives without properly disclosing the risks involved in trading. Wall Street executives say clues to how Gensler will regulate gamification might be found in the upcoming IPO documents for trading app Robinhood, which has been in negotiations with the SEC about becoming a public company via its private filing.

Robinhood, which offers trading with no fees, is planning to come public later this summer; its IPO document known as an S-1 will be publicly released imminently."

FOX Business has discussed the costs with Wall Street executives, analysts and think tank leaders, and while no exact estimate can be determined, the SEC’s new disclosure mandates involving everything from the environment to board diversity is likely to cost U.S. public companies well into the billions of dollars.

Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, known for his progressive leanings, has put at the top of the commission’s voting agenda new rules that will mandate disclosing information on so-called ESG or Environmental, Social, Governance issues. These issues involve a public company's commitment to alleviate climate change and other non-financial disclosures.

SEC PICKS AS CORPORATE REGULATOR A PROFESSOR WHO CRITICIZED STARTUP ‘UNICORNS’

Gensler met with President Biden and other top financial regulators on Monday to discuss climate-related financial risks and how regulators can push the president’s green and social agenda through edicts aimed at public companies. Gensler has said such disclosures are being demanded by a new breed of investor looking to make corporate America more socially responsible.

But critics such as business groups, and GOP lawmakers say the move by the SEC is part of a broader effort by the Biden administration to force companies to embrace a progressive social agenda. They also contend the commission is exceeding its authority that has traditionally focused on protecting small investors from financial fraud.

Gensler is forging ahead, however, and given the political makeup of the commission with Democrats outnumbering GOP commissioners by a 3-to-2 majority, he is likely to push through his new disclosure mandates possibly by the end of the year, say people with knowledge of the chairman’s thinking.

According to the proposed new disclosure standards, companies must ""ramp up disclosures regarding their climate change-related risks,"" and ""enhance (company) disclosures about the diversity of board members and nominees.""

SEC MULLS GAMESTOP, AMC ‘GAMIFICATION’ CRACKDOWN WITH REGULATORY LAYER

While there is a contentious debate about the need for such disclosures, one thing is certain: Companies will be spending significant sums of money on both lawyers and consultants on how best to disclose a corporation’s carbon footprint and the new diversity mandates.

For example, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, estimates that the new corporate disclosure rules will cost ""billions of dollars"", and possibly leading to lower shareholder returns. The group also warns of massive legal liabilities as progressive activists challenge the veracity of the corporate disclosures since the SEC rule, at least in its current proposed form, is amorphous and thus leaves room for various interpretations.

""It’s not a one size fits all approach"", says Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors. ""ESG reporting is so vague, there’s really no way to quantify it.""

An SEC spokesman declined to comment, but the woke disclosure rules have their support in certain areas of the financial business that has focused on ESG investing. Blackrock, the world’s largest money manager, is offering a slew of new ESG funds that screen for companies that meet ESG standards but also charge investors higher fees than other funds offered by the company.

Blackrock’s CEO, Larry Fink, has been an advocate of social investing and using Blackrock’s clout (it manages nearly $9 trillion) to push for these reforms at the companies it invests in. The firm recently voted to place on the board of oil giant ExxonMobil three activist shareholders from the ESG-centric fund, Engine No 1.

""I think spending billions (on these disclosures) is exaggerated,"" said Columbia law professor John Coffee, an expert in corporate governance matters. ""And as Engine No. 1 proved with Exxon, shareholders appear willing to vote for such goals.""

Some Wall Street analysts say the size of the costs for these disclosures could easily run into the billions of dollars as they spend money on consultants to prepare for the additional disclosure, plus in the case of banks, they may also be barred from doing business with companies that are deemed fully committed to the woke policies.

""Mandated disclosures could impact (banks) bottom line because they might be forced not to lend to companies and businesses that don't meet the ESG standards,"" said Dick Bove, an analyst at Odeon Capital.

Also, the costs will fall disproportionately on smaller public companies that don’t have the same cash on hand and the staff to deal with the new legal issues.

""This whole ESG thing is just one giant waste of time and money,"" added Whalen Global Advisors chief, Chris Whalen, ""It’s just a big show that only benefits the consultants and the lawyers who are making money off of this."""

The problem stems from one of the nation's largest gas production hubs in Mississippi called the Jackson Dome. It's a natural source for CO2, and it's where many breweries get their supply from.

John Raquet, the Chairman and Founder of Gas World, a leading news outlet covering the gas industry, says the dome is still producing CO2, but has elevated levels of other hydrocarbons that do not meet food and beverage standards for use.

""It's causing a tightness in the market,"" Raquet said. ""I think it is a crisis at the moment when you have breweries telling their staff you're going to be laid off because we're not getting supplies until September or October.

Policymakers approved two consecutive 75-basis point rate hikes in June and July and have suggested that another increase of that magnitude is on the table in September.

Businesses also struggled to onboard new employees, with nearly half of owners (49%) reporting that they could not fill open jobs. The Labor Department reported last week that there were 10.7 million open jobs at the end of June. The number of available jobs has topped 10 million for eight consecutive months; before the pandemic began in February 2020, the highest on record was 7.7 million.

The department said the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods, including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 9.1% in June from a year ago. Prices jumped 1.3% in the one-month period from May. Those figures were both far higher than the 8.8% headline figure and 1% monthly gain forecast by Refinitiv economists.

The data marked the fastest pace of inflation since December 1981.

Price increases were extensive with energy prices rising 7.5% in June from the previous month and up 41.6% from last year. Gasoline, on average, costs 59.9% more than it did one year ago and 11.2% more than it did in May. The food index, meanwhile, climbed 1% in June, as consumers paid more for items like cereal, chicken, milk and fresh vegetables.

Summer staples, including hotdogs, have been costing more as well. Hot dogs increased by more than 16% compared to the same time last year and ice cream rose more than 12%.

Why you should avoid them: Cash advance loans are still significantly more expensive than traditional personal loans, or even credit cards.
Because of this added protection, lenders often have lower credit score requirements for secured loans and may even approve borrowers with a bad credit score.","Our goal here at Credible Operations, Inc., NMLS Number 1681276, referred to as ""Credible"" below, is to give you the tools and confidence you need to improve your finances. Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.

Getting a personal loan can be difficult if you have a limited credit history or bad credit. Some lenders that target bad credit borrowers promise no credit check and fast funding. But these loans often come with expensive fees that can trap you in a cycle of debt.

If you’re struggling to choose the right personal loan — or finding it flat-out impossible — you may start to feel discouraged. Before you settle for an expensive loan product, though, here are some bad credit loans that you should avoid — whether you just need a few hundred dollars, want a $10,000 loan , or anything in between.



Credible makes it easy to see your prequalified personal loan rates from various lenders, all in one place.

1. Payday loans

A payday loan is a small, short-term loan intended to tide you over with an advance until your next payday. Storefront payday lenders typically offer these loans, but you may also find them online. Depending on your state, there may also be a maximum borrowing limit, often $500 or less. Lenders usually require borrowers to repay these loans in two to four weeks’ time, in one lump sum, plus fees.

If you’re struggling to make ends meet before your paycheck hits, this can seem like an enticing loan option, especially if you need same-day funds .

Why you should avoid them: Most payday loan lenders don’t have strict credit- or income-based qualifications, so they often loan money to people who may struggle to repay the debt . Additionally, these loans are notoriously expensive. While most states cap the interest that can be charged per $100 borrowed, this is usually in the range of $10 to $30.

While that may not sound like too much, when you consider the length of the loan term and the low borrowing limits, these fees work out to an astronomical APR. For example, a $100 payday loan with a two-week repayment term and a $15 fee equates to an APR of nearly 400%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

Compare that to the average interest rate on a 24-month personal loan — 8.73% in May 2022, according to the Federal Reserve — and it’s easy to see what a ""deal"" payday loans really work out to be.

2. Cash advance loans

A cash advance loan is similar to a payday loan, in that you can use its short-term funds to help you cover immediate or unexpected expenses. These loans can even be funded as quickly as the same day, depending on the lender.

Cash advance loans differ from payday loans in some important ways, though. For starters, you can usually borrow a lot more with a cash advance loan, with some lenders offering as much as $5,000. You don’t always have to repay a cash advance loan in just a few weeks, either; you may be able to take out a cash advance that you can repay in monthly installments.

Why you should avoid them: Cash advance loans are still significantly more expensive than traditional personal loans, or even credit cards. Depending on the lender, your cash advance loan could have an APR of 299% or more.

3. Car title loans

If you have bad credit and need to borrow money, using your vehicle as collateral to get a car title loan could be one option. But car title loans aren’t a good choice for most borrowers.

Title loans often have repayment terms as short as 30 days, though you might find installment options as long as 24 months. The amount you can borrow depends on your location, as well as the value of your vehicle — as long as you own your vehicle free and clear.

Why you should avoid them: The downside? You probably already guessed it: You’ll pay significantly more in interest with a title loan than with a traditional personal loan. It’s not uncommon for car title loans to have APRs in the triple digits.

More than that, though, you’re securing the loan with one of your most important assets: your car. If you were to default on your title loan, the lender could take ownership of your vehicle.

4. Pawn shop loans

A pawn shop loan is a short-term loan that’s secured by something you own, such as jewelry or other valuables. These loans typically allow you to access money quickly, depending on how much your valuables are worth.

Pawn shop lenders typically don’t run a credit check, so these loans can seem like a good option for borrowers with poor credit or those looking for a no-credit-check loan . The pawn shop will usually offer a percentage of the pawned item’s value in loan form. You’ll need to repay the loan by an agreed-upon date, or the shop keeps the item.

Why you should avoid them: If you repay the loan as agreed, you can get your valuables back. But your pawn shop loan will have accrued interest in the interim, which you’ll also need to pay. These loans also tend to have a variety of fees tacked on, such as storage, setup, and even appraisal fees. For this reason, a lower interest rate can be deceptive, as the loan will actually end up costing you considerably more in the end.

Try a personal loan instead

If you need funds for an unexpected expense, large purchase, or even to refinance high-interest debt, a traditional personal loan is often your best bet — even if you have bad credit. Here are some things you can do to increase your chances of qualifying for one:

Apply with a cosigner. Adding a cosigner with good credit to your personal loan application may be the answer to getting approved or snagging better interest rates. Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit.

Just note that your cosigner will be responsible for making the loan payments if you default, and the debt will be reported on their credit. Check your credit reports. If your low credit score is keeping you from getting a personal loan, it’s important to understand why. Check your credit reports to see what sort of negative items are bringing down your score. In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected.

In some cases, you may find errors that you can dispute, which will help improve your score quickly if it’s corrected. Consider a secured personal loan. A secured loan uses one or more of your assets as collateral for the debt. Because of this added protection, lenders often have lower credit score requirements for secured loans and may even approve borrowers with a bad credit score.

How mortgage rates have changed over time

Today’s mortgage interest rates are well below the highest annual average rate recorded by Freddie Mac — 16.63% in 1981. A year before the COVID-19 pandemic upended economies across the world, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for 2019 was 3.94%. The average rate for 2021 was 2.96%, the lowest annual average in 30 years.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates.

If you’re ready to take advantage of current mortgage refinance rates that are below average historical lows, you can use Credible to check rates from multiple lenders .

When is it worth it to refinance?

Refinancing a mortgage can be a great way to save money. But it’s not always the best move for every homeowner.

People refinance for a number of reasons, including to get a lower interest rate, change their monthly payment amount and lower their interest costs. Generally, if you can lower your interest rate by at least 0.75%, refinancing might be a good move.

But before you refinance, be sure to weigh closing costs, and calculate how long it will take before your savings from the refinance cover the expenses of refinancing.

What is a good mortgage rate?

Generally, a good mortgage rate is one that’s the lowest you can qualify for based on your individual factors, such as credit history, income, other debts, down payment amount, and more.

A rate that’s good for your financial situation should result in a monthly mortgage payment that you can manage, while leaving plenty of room in your monthly budget to put toward savings, investments, and an emergency fund. And a good rate should be competitive with average rates in the geographic area where you’re looking to buy.

BNPL INCLUSION IN CREDIT REPORTS CAUSES GROWING CONSUMER CONCERNS, SURVEY CLAIMS

Americans coping with rising prices

Inflation is currently surging and increased in June to a new 40-year high, marking the fifth time it's broken that record this year. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 9.1% annually in June, hitting its highest point since November 1981, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

Because of this, many consumers are needing to dip into their savings or fund their purchases with credit, according to data from Morning Consult Economic Intelligence . Intentions to buy big-ticket items such as electronics, trips and vacations, home appliances and furniture have all decreased over the past year.

But despite these setbacks, consumer balance sheets are historically strong, according to Morning Consult. Net wealth as a share of disposable income is currently near a record high as household debt as a share of total assets is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, according to data from the Federal Reserve.

Because of this, some consumers, especially from higher-income households, are actually increasing their spending and expected spending, according to the Morning Consult report. Households with an annual income of at least $50,000 reported a 25% increase in monthly spending from May 2021 to May 2022.

""To put it simply: People still have the means to buy things, but they are expecting items to cost more,"" the report stated. ""And Morning Consult data indicates that they’re using BNPL to pay for some of them. The consistency with which U.S. consumers have used BNPL to fund their purchases throughout 2022 indicates that the payment form may be helping to keep their price sensitivity and substitutions at bay, and should be viewed as an indicator of the staying power of BNPL.""

If you have used BNPL to pay for your purchases and want to pay it down, consider using a personal loan to help pay your debt. Visit Credible to compare multiple lenders at once and choose the one with the best interest rate for you.

APPLE’S CONSUMER DATA PROVIDES 'COMPETITIVE EDGE' FOR BNPL, EXPERT SAYS

Americans continue to use BNPL options for purchases

The use of BNPL payments is not slowing, and the share of adults who used BNPL to fund a purchase at least once in the past month has not dropped below 16% in 2022, according to Morning Consult’s report.

Adults with annual income between $50,000 and $99,999 as well as those with an annual income of $100,000 or more are even more likely to have used BNPL for a purchase over the past month at 21% and 20%, respectively.

And consumers expect to continue using BNPL.

""As more retailers partner with BNPL providers and more payment providers create their own BNPL offerings, adoption and strong usage will likely continue,"" the report stated.

Even as consumers purchase less big ticket items, they will continue to use BNPL for a wide variety of other purchases. Morning Consult’s report showed 35% of respondents used BNPL to purchase apparel, 32% used it to purchase electronics and 23% used it for footwear.

The home, which was built in 1937, was originally designed for the actress and her then-boyfriend, conductor Leopold Stokowski, the conductor for Disney’s ""Fantasia."" It’s now listed by Mark Mintz at Compass.

The property, which sits atop a hill in the Beverly Crest neighborhood, has six bedrooms and six bathrooms. It features sprawling 180-degree views spanning from downtown Los Angeles to the ocean and includes a spacious deck, lush lawns and an infinity pool. The space, which was fully renovated in 2006 by celebrated designer Nicole Sassaman, highlights open living areas, sliding glass doors, rich woods and stonework throughout.

NYC APARTMENT OF HOLLYWOOD LEGEND GRETA GARBO HITS MARKET FOR $7.25M: ‘CINEMATIC VIEWS'

The Oscar-nominated star, who was fiercely protective of her privacy, saw to it that the home kept her out of the public eye. In her lifetime, Garbo famously said, ""I just want to be left alone."" The original small windows, along with the towering exterior walls, provided a space for Garbo to leisurely roam and sunbathe in seclusion. The courtyard, which was enclosed by high walls, was well beyond the reach of photographers. It became a hot spot for Hollywood's elite to gather.

Garbo and Stokowski ultimately called it quits, and he went on to marry heiress Gloria Vanderbilt in 1945. Garbo kept the house, and it was eventually occupied by several tenants, including singer/actor Tab Hunter. A Russian filmmaker, who is the current homeowner, loved the home’s history so much that he bought it under ""Greta Garbo LLC.""

After earning three Academy Award nominations, Garbo retired at age 35 and moved to New York City, where she became a known recluse. Garbo passed away in 1990 at age 84.

Sassaman, who was also captivated by the home’s history, spent nearly two years remodeling the space, which was transformed into ""a modern marvel,"" Elle Decor reported. She doubled the living space by erecting a second story.

""The hilltop view was stunning, but the estate didn’t take advantage of it because the house had been built to keep the inhabitants in and the press out,"" Sassaman told the outlet. ""We added as much glass as city code would permit, and this tactic transformed the home from dark and secluded to open and airy.""

Sassaman also made changes to the layout of the home to enhance its charm. A patio was converted into a living room with panoramic views of both the city and the infinity pool. Garbo’s bedroom became a home office, and the primary suite was installed on the newly constructed second floor. Another outdoor patio was enclosed and added to the kitchen, which provided more space to cook, dine and entertain.

The lower bedroom and bath, previously a guest room during Hunter’s residency, became a gym. Each space in the property was specifically tweaked by Sassaman to ensure a view.

""I worked to meld the worlds of yesterday and today together,"" she said.

The curved fireplace in Garbo’s original master bedroom was retained, as was the home’s sinuous exterior. Sassaman said she also kept the home’s unusual lines to stay true to Garbo’s time.

""The first time I saw the house, I couldn't believe that it had been sitting in such a poor state for so long,"" said Sassaman. ""But I immediately saw how the home could be turned into something really special if I just let its glamorous past guide the renovation.""

He deserves to see his dream come true and I’m going to do it for him.
Siegel: That’s a good example.","Jackie Siegel is determined to finish building the largest single-family home in America – no matter the cost.

The Florida mom and her family, whose lives were the subject of the 2012 documentary ""The Queen of Versailles,"" is back for the Discovery+ docuseries ""The Queen of Versailles Reigns Again."" The show explores the challenges the 56-year-old and her husband David Siegel have endured in finishing the construction of their home, a project that has been more than 20 years in the making.

The 90,000-square-foot mega-mansion, inspired by the Versailles palace in France, features six kitchens, a 35-car garage, a 150-person dining room, a grand ballroom with gemstone-encrusted floors and a British pub. Siegel also has big dreams to have a Benihana hibachi grill installed and an aviary with toucans and flamingos. When done, the mother of eight suspects the home could be worth $200 million.

The Siegels have faced numerous obstacles over the years. After buying the land for the home in 2000, construction was halted during an economic downturn that impacted patriarch David Siegel, founder of Orlando-based Westgates Resorts. The family also endured a personal tragedy when their 18-year-old daughter, Victoria Siegel, passed away in 2015 from an overdose of methadone and antidepressants.

JILL ZARIN HEADS BACK TO 'HOUSEWIVES' AFTER BUILDING BUSINESS EMPIRE: 'IT WAS LIKE I NEVER LEFT'

Today, Siegel is feeling hopeful about the future of her family – and home. And she’s inviting cameras to follow her along for the ride. Siegel spoke to FOX Business about when the home will finally be completed, how she coped with the public scrutiny following her daughter’s death and the challenges she’s currently facing.

FOX Business: What compelled you to share your story in ""Queen of Versailles Reigns Again""?

Jackie Siegel: It’s been a rough road since the original documentary came out. A lot of offers came to us over the years, but we were very wary of how we were going to be portrayed. And then we lost our daughter. My world just crumbled down from there. It felt like nothing mattered anymore. I felt such sadness. I had lost my passion to do anything. It was a sad, dark time in my life.

But then, my husband and I started our foundation because we felt we could make a difference. We felt we were in a position to help others. I felt ready. When we were approached this time around, I felt the timing was right. The foundation had become a big part of our lives… And the truth is, everywhere I go, people always approach me and ask me the same question – whatever happened to the house? So this is my answer. It covers everything people have been wanting to know.

FOX Business: The show chronicles the challenges of building a house as large as yours. Why continue to create the largest single-family home in the country?

Siegel: The thing is we’ve already got over $50 million into the house. No one is going to buy it as is. And it’s my husband’s passion. We’re not getting any younger and our kids are growing up. I want to do this for him. And the house certainly has the queen’s touch. I want to live here as a family and the structure is already there. Right now we live on a private island in the middle of the lake that we bought in the meantime. Had we gotten this property first, we probably wouldn’t have built this other house. But it’s already under construction.

Also, my kids are getting involved. They’re really excited about this project. I’m also thinking about the possibilities. I’m going to have a grand ballroom that could hold 500 people. I could do a lot of events there to raise awareness and save lives from the drug epidemic. I can use the house to gain the attention that we need to raise awareness. I could host fundraisers, do a retreat or just invite people for a charity event where I can educate them. It will also be good for our kids, our grandkids and loved ones. We already have the home and own it. Why not see it through? I've got to find a way.

FOX Business: When do you believe the house will finally be finished?

Siegel: My goal is to have the house finished by May 3, 2023. That’s my husband’s 80th birthday. He almost missed his birthday last year because he was getting back surgery and was at the hospital. He caught pneumonia and at his age, that’s really scary. He deserves to see his dream come true and I’m going to do it for him.

FOX Business: What do you believe has been the biggest challenge you’ve faced recently in getting the house completed?

Siegel: The biggest problem is that there’s more than one problem *laughs*. The house was dormant for many years and wasn’t maintained. So I have issues with the natural aging of the house. The marble was falling off the exterior, and other areas were exposed and rusty. I had to structurally fix a lot of things, which I wasn’t anticipating. So it’s almost like it was under renovation at the same time we're constructing it.

We had to knock down walls and things like that because I’m redesigning the kids’ bedrooms. They no longer need a nanny’s room connected to their room. They rather have a large closet. And with the COVID pandemic, a lot of things slowed down in terms of the supply chain. For example, the floor of my grand ballroom is going to be made with semi-precious stones. These are beautiful stones from 22 different countries all over the world. And then we had to ship them to Indonesia. I went to Indonesia to check on the floor and do some quality control, which I’m glad I did because we still had to make changes.

There’s so much to oversee. Like the library, it’s going to have one of the most ornate wooden floors you’ve ever seen. We’re going to have an artist create something for us and this is his last project before he retires. He’s out in the country outside of Paris making our floor for us. We have to come up with the design for everything – and everything is a piece of art. This is more than a home. This is a palace.

FOX Business: Your home is even going to have a British pub among its many features. Did you originally have an idea for something that just didn’t work out?

Siegel: I needed a larger closet… but I couldn’t have two stories. I want to have a closet with an elevator so I can go up or down from my house. That’s a challenge. I originally wanted to find a way to connect the house to the island where you can do some zip-lining. But there are lots of high restrictions and things need to be approved. There are code issues as well. But if the sprinklers go off, for example, the artwork would be ruined. I had to put a fireproof stairwell that’s so ugly and takes up space, but it was necessary.

FOX Business: A big dream of yours, among many, is to have a Benihana built inside the home. How’s that going?

Siegel: That’s a good example. We have to take it out… But my husband really wants it. And our family is so picky when it comes to food, but one thing they all love is Benihana. They will all show up for that. We can all sit at the table together and everybody’s happy *laughs*. That’s the main reason he wants it.

FOX Business: What’s a misconception you feel the press or the public still has about you?

Siegel: … People that I’ve never met, of course, think that I married for money. But then when they see me, they’re the first ones to go, ""Oh my God, we love you."" *laughs*. My life isn’t about flashing money around and showing off. We’re doing all of this for us. We’re private people, except our story is exposed to the media.

BETHENNY FRANKEL REFLECTS ON HER BUSINESS EMPIRE, SKINNYGIRL'S FUTURE: 'I LIKE THAT BLOOD, SWEAT, TEARS'

… But the truth is, my family and our future come first. I’m still a small hometown girl at heart. My boys told me, ""Since we’re building a house like this one, we should really have a family crest."" If you would have asked me what a family crest was, I would pull out a tube of toothpaste! I’ve always been the same.

FOX Business: What kept you going after losing your daughter?

Siegel: … It was difficult, losing your child and then having the headlines bash family… Meanwhile, you’re mourning and wondering, ""What did I do wrong?"" But you can’t live with guilt your whole life. And those newspapers actually did us a favor because they pushed me and gave me the strength to speak about our experience publicly so that other parents are spared from going through a similar pain.

This notoriety puts me in a position where my voice can be heard. And it helps me to know that my daughter didn’t die in vain, that her story is, in some way, saving so many other lives. That so many people are learning about the impact of the opioid crisis. It helps with my healing process."

John McGraw, former chairman of McGraw-Hill Publishing, and his wife, Marjorie, were the first to purchase the property from the Garbo estate in 2017 for $8.5 million.

The McGraws took it upon themselves to renovate areas of the home, such as the kitchen and dining room, while preserving much of the home's Garbo-fashioned elements and spaces.

""This home is for the discerning buyer who is seeking dramatic, cinematic river and city views and the elegance that defined Garbo.""

Listing agent Brian Lewis of Compass Real Estate disclosed in an interview with Fox News Digital that the McGraws are choosing to sell the apartment now that they're spending a majority of their time away with family.

They would rather the home be enjoyed by ""someone who can really be there.""

The unit is based in The Campanile at the end of a cul-de-sac on 52nd St. It offers panoramic views of the East River and of the Queensboro Bridge.

Co-listing agent Will Kerr with Corcoran Real Estate detailed on a call with Fox News Digital that the 1927 pre-war building — pre-dating Manhattan's FDR Drive — has a ""beautiful"" venetian-style facade and exudes a ""real energy and calmness.""

The Compass real estate professional pointed out that Garbo’s bedroom still features custom elements that the movie star herself designed, including the wallpaper, the rugs and woodwork made out of wood shipped from Sweden.

The Swedish-born actress, who starred in classic ‘20s and ‘30s films like ""Mata Hari"" and ""Grand Hotel,"" first purchased the fifth-floor, luxury unit in 1954. She lived there until her death in 1990.

It’s been said the star chose this home because the boats passing on the river reminded her of her native Stockholm.

Since then, the home has been modernized with amenities such as an HVAC system, a gas fireplace and the McGraws' renovated kitchen and dining spaces.

FOX Business: Marilyn passed away 60 years ago.
FOX Business: How difficult is it to find and buy authentic Marilyn memorabilia today?
And it’s not only with Marilyn items.","Marilyn Monroe’s market value is still shining brightly 60 years after her death.

The Hollywood actress, also known as America’s most famous sex symbol, died in August 1962 at age 36. According to reports, the star had a net worth of $800K at the time of her death, which is nearly $8 million in today's money.

Monroe’s net worth in 2022 is a reported $10 million. In 2020, she ranked No. 13 on Forbes’ list of highest-paid dead celebrities due to her image and name being used by nearly 100 brands globally. A fictionalized version of the star is the subject of an upcoming Netflix film, ""Blonde,"" which has received an NC-17 rating.

Scott Fortner, a lifelong fan, is determined to keep Monroe’s legacy alive by preserving some of her most prized possessions. Fortner, who is considered an authority on Monroe, assists major auction companies in authenticating and verifying memorabilia.

REMEMBERING MARILYN MONROE, ACTRESS, FASHION ICON, AND SEX SYMBOL 60 YEARS AFTER HER DEATH

He owns the world’s largest private collection of Monroe’s personal property and archives, which he shares on both his website and social media.

This year, he’ll be celebrating her life at several events at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California.

Fortner spoke to FOX Business about how he became a sought-after collector and why Monroe is more valuable than ever and offered his advice for fans eager to obtain an authentic piece of history.

FOX Business: How did you end up becoming a Marilyn Monroe memorabilia collector?

Scott Fortner: Like anyone, you’re just taken by someone or find yourself very interested in a particular figure. That’s what happened to me when I was probably 12 or 13. I was really fascinated by Marilyn Monroe. I started collecting books and magazines as I read and learned more about her. This continued through adulthood.

Then, in 1999, her entire estate was put up for auction at Christie’s in New York. That auction really set the stage for celebrity auctions. I acquired the catalog from the auction, which became another book for my collection. But then I started to see some items from the 1999 sale that were being resold online on eBay and at other auction houses.

I thought to myself, ""Why am I collecting books and magazines when I could be collecting items that Marilyn owned?"" That’s how it started over two decades ago. … This isn’t an organization or a company investing in these items for business purposes or other concepts. I just happen to be a fan who’s lucky enough to collect.

FOX Business: Do your items ever get loaned out to museums or is it strictly private?

Fortner: As someone lucky enough to obtain these items, I feel a bit of an obligation and a duty to share them with the rest of the world and give other fans an opportunity to see Marilyn through her objects in the same way that I do.

I loan my collection for exhibitions. It’s been on exhibit around the world. I’ve often participated in opportunities to raise money for charitable causes. For example, some items have been on display to raise money for the actual orphanage where Marilyn lived as a child, which is still in business today.

FOX Business: What’s your process like in finding authentic memorabilia?

Fortner: When I first started, I didn’t know much about the auction business as we know it today. Over the years, I’ve come to learn more about the auction industry. I’m now connected with most of the major auction companies around the world, such as Christie’s, Julien’s Auctions and Heritage. Those are your top auction companies for entertainment memorabilia.

I’m also pretty well known in the collecting community. A lot of times people will reach out to me privately to see if I might be interested in purchasing something that they may have. I believe networking and learning are really important if you want to expand your collection. And I’m always looking for the next thing to add to my collection.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

FOX Business: How many items do you currently own?

Fortner: I don’t have an exact number anymore. I stopped counting. But it’s in the several hundreds.

FOX Business: What would you say is your crown jewel?

Fortner: The item that I get asked the most about is Marilyn’s personal Pucci blouse. During the last few years of her life, she wore Pucci quite a lot. It was an Italian designer that she discovered, which shifted her look away from the ‘50s, such as the tight skirts and sweaters. It was a more modern, easier look. She had several Pucci items in her closet. She was also buried in a green Pucci dress. So the brand has become synonymous with Marilyn.

The blouse I own happens to be the blouse she was wearing in the photos taken on the weekend before she passed away, the last photos ever taken of her alive. It’s the item I get frequently asked about in terms of selling. It’s not for sale. I’m a collector, not a dealer.

The most recent item I’ve added to my collection is something I’ve wanted for quite some time. It’s a pair of Marilyn’s Ferragamo high heels. The white Ferragamo high heel was a go-to look for her. There are countless photos of Marilyn wearing them throughout the ‘50s and ‘60s. It’s a new staple in my collection that I added just last month.

MARILYN MONROE’S FIGURE-HUGGING GOWN BECOMES TOP SELLER AT AUCTION: SHE’S ‘STILL TURNING HEADS TO THIS DAY’

FOX Business: Which item was the hardest for you to obtain?

Fortner: Marilyn attended a benefit for the Actor’s Studio. She was an usherette. People would come into the theater, and Marilyn would escort them to their seats and hand them a program. I’m sure that must have been quite the experience to be escorted by Marilyn. She wore an ensemble that consisted of an evening dress and a matching cape. That item came up for auction several years ago. I bid on the item and was told that I had won. It turned out that it didn’t make the minimum bid or the reserve.

A lot of times, a seller will say, ""If it doesn’t reach this certain amount, I’m not going to sell the item."" I found out after the auction and I went through the grueling process of attempting to negotiate with the seller. I bought it privately after the fact. It took several months for that to happen. But I was fortunate because it’s probably one of Marilyn’s most well-known public events. Now I have that cape as part of my collection.

FOX Business: Marilyn passed away 60 years ago. Why do you believe she’s more valuable than ever?

Fortner: For starters, she’s an icon. And I think people relate to her in so many ways today. Some people just enjoy her photos. Others enjoy her films. Some people relate to the personal struggles that she endured throughout her life. What I often find is that people feel a connection to her. There’s a sense of wanting to protect her. I think her appeal is very broad. And it’s not just in the United States — it’s worldwide. I’ve connected with other collectors and fans around the world, so her reach is very extensive and long-lasting. She’s an icon of beauty, for fashion and a legend of the silver screen.

FOX Business: How difficult is it to find and buy authentic Marilyn memorabilia today?

Fortner: What I’m seeing now is that people are very much holding onto their collectibles and memorabilia because it is increasing in value as time goes by. So whenever there is an auction, the number of pieces available can be very limiting. And Marilyn is one of those people whose value doesn’t decrease. She holds value and increases in value. So people aren’t as quick to put up their items for auction. Therefore, the availability is getting harder.

MARILYN MONROE'S DRESSES FROM POPULAR MOVIES UP FOR AUCTION

FOX Business: How can one determine whether an item is authentic or not? What are some tell-tale signs you look out for?

Fortner: One of the first things you want to do is ensure you’re verifying authenticity. Where did the item come from? Did it come from that 1999 Christie’s sale or another auction sale, such as from Julien’s? You want to make sure it came from a major auction company and verify the year it was originally sold. Also, is there a photo that can be matched with the item? Is there a photo of Marilyn wearing the item, whether it was at home or a public event? Many items from my collection are photographed with Marilyn.

What I tell people to avoid is what I call second- or third-generation items, such as a seller saying, ""Marilyn gave this to me."" Those items usually come with a letter or certificate of authenticity. Those items are very risky purchases and, usually, they’re not authentic. There’s a huge market today, particularly on eBay, where people will create certificates of authenticity claiming this is an authentic item when, in reality, it was probably something acquired from a secondhand store. They’ll just purchase the item, create a letter of authenticity, and then sell it for thousands of dollars on eBay. Unfortunately, many people tend to believe an item is real just because it comes with a certificate claiming it came from Marilyn’s makeup artist or hairstylist. Usually, that’s not the case.

I’m so often contacted by people who say, ""I’ve got this item for sale, and here’s the letter of authenticity for it."" I’m in the position of having to tell them, ""This item is not real, and here’s how I know that."" A perfect example involves Marilyn’s foster sister, Bebe Goddard. Marilyn lived with the Goddard family for some time. [Later on], Bebe worked with a memorabilia dealer to create items that he sold for her, which were fake pieces. They even went as far as to spray Chanel No. 5 on those items. After she passed away, it was verified through her documents that these items were sold to people. Just because it was someone who was a part of Marilyn’s life, people believed they were real. And these items came with a certificate of authenticity claiming they were real.

Today, people continue to create these fake letters of authenticity. And it’s not only with Marilyn items. It’s with all kinds of celebrity memorabilia. There are a few real items on eBay that are authentic. I would advise people to stick with the major auction companies.

NYC APARTMENT OF HOLLYWOOD LEGEND GRETA GARBO HITS MARKET FOR $7.25M: ‘CINEMATIC VIEWS'

Also, autographs are very easy to forge. Today’s printers are so good. You can easily take a check, even an authentic Marilyn-owned check, and do a photocopy on the front and back. Then you’ll frame that item in a display case. A lot of times, people will do that. And, of course, many will think it’s real when, in reality, it’s just a copy. There are many other ways people forge signatures, even in autograph books and photographs. You have to do your homework and make sure that the item you’re purchasing is truly authentic.

FOX Business: What about if you’re a Marilyn fan and want to own something that once belonged to her? What’s the first piece of advice you would give them?

Fortner: My first piece of advice is to make sure this is something you’re going to have interest in the long-term, not just a spur-of-the-moment purchase. You don’t want to have buyer’s remorse. Also, set a budget. Auctions can get very emotional. It’s also very competitive. For some people, they just want to win. You want to make sure you set a budget and try not to go over it.

People also tend to forget there are premiums that the auction companies apply as part of selling an item, as well as taxes. I have come across people who don’t realize that, after winning an auction, there’s a certain percentage on top of that for the premium and then another percentage on top of that for state taxes. It does add up. I would also stick to the major auction companies, especially if you’re starting.

FOX Business: Every year, Marilyn continues to be one of the top-earning dead celebrities. How is she earning top dollar today?

Fortner: Marilyn’s estate is owned by Authentic Brands Group, which is a company that owns the rights, licenses, marketing, advertising and branding for many deceased celebrities. They license Marilyn’s name and image to people who want to promote certain products. She’s still very much in demand, which is why Marilyn is one of the highest-earning dead celebrities today."

Affleck kept busy pursuing small roles, including 1991’s ""Daddy,"" 1992’s ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" as well as ""School Ties."" He appeared as either a bully or jock in projects like ""Against the Grain,"" ""Body to Die For: The Aaron Henry Story,"" ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""School Ties.""

It wouldn’t be until 1997’s ""Good Will Hunting"" that his career skyrocketed. The script for the film started as a 40-page assignment for Damon’s playwriting class at Harvard University. Affleck and Damon teamed up to write the script, which their agent later shopped around at various studios. The screenplay was eventually accepted by Miramax, where the men were given creative control. The screenplay was reportedly sold for $300,000. The film made the duo overnight stars and Affleck won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. In 1998, Affleck and Damon set up Pearl Street Films, a production company. They would later form another production company called LivePlanet.

Affleck, 49, made his mark in several blockbuster films, including 1998’s ""Armageddon"" and ""Shakespeare in Love,"" also released that same year. He has also appeared in every View Askewniverse film by his pal, director Kevin Smith, including 1999’s ""Dogma,"" 2001’s ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" 2006’s ""Clerks II,"" and 2019’s ""Jay and Silent Bob Reboot."" Affleck, who has had a passion for working behind the scenes, directed his first film, ""Gone Baby Gone,"" in 2007. He wrote, produced and directed 2010’s ""The Town."" He produced, directed and starred in 2012’s ""Argo,"" which won the Oscar for Best Picture.

Affleck’s paycheck in Hollywood has increased over the years. The 2000 film ""Reindeer Games"" earned him $6 million, while 2002’s ""Changing Lanes"" and ""The Sum of All Fears"" resulted in $10 million each. While ""Daredevil"" and ""Gigli"" were box office bombs, he still obtained $11.5 million and $12.5 million for his roles.

Over the years, Affleck has supported several charities, including the Paralyzed Veterans of America, Eastern Congo Initiative, the A-T Children's Project and Feeding America.

INSIDE THE WILD $65M MANSION JENNIFER LOPEZ AND BEN AFFLECK JUST TOURED

When it came to real estate, Affleck and Lopez spent $17.5 million in 2009 for a home previously owned by producer Brian Grazer. Lopez lived in the property until late 2018, when she and Affleck reportedly sold the mansion to Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine for $32 million. That year, Affleck bought a $19 million mansion in the Pacific Palisades.

Lopez and Affleck famously dated in the early 2000s, spawning the nickname ""Bennifer,"" before rekindling their romance last year. They earlier starred together in 2003′s ""Gigli"" and 2004′s ""Jersey Girl."" Around that time, they became engaged but never wed.

Affleck married Jennifer Garner in 2005, with whom he shares three children. They divorced in 2018.

Lopez has been married three times before. She was briefly married to Ojani Noa from 1997-1998 and to Cris Judd from 2001-2003. She and singer Marc Anthony were married for a decade after their wedding in 2004 and share 14-year-old twins.

Both Ukraine and Russia are thought to be using DJI drones in combat, even though the company maintains that its products are intended for civilian use.

Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykhailo Federov wrote an open letter last month appealing to DJI to block sales of its drones in Russia, contending that Russian troops were using ""DJI products in Ukraine in order to navigate their missiles to kill civilians.""

The AeroScope system installed in DJI drones allows the detection and monitoring of other drones and their operators in the vicinity via special receivers. The worry is that Russians might be using the AeroScope system to attack Ukraine drone pilots.

DJI has rejected claims that it leaked data on Ukraine’s military positions to Russia, after German retailer Mediamarkt cited Russia’s use of DJI drones in the war as a reason it removed the company’s products from its shelves.

Last week, DJI said in a statement that its drones are not marketed or sold for military use. It said it ""unequivocally opposed attempts to attach weapons"" to its products.

But Sievert’s cancellation opened the floodgates. It was as if the Hoover Dam of show guests had broken.

I’ve been covering CES since 2008 and every year, the world’s largest microchip manufacturer has claimed the biggest footprint – a sprawling booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center where the company spent a fortune designing a huge, glittering display of its latest silicon chips that laptop and tablet makers couldn’t run or compute without.

What happened was just the opposite, and as the Supreme Court considers President Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate and COVID-19 testing rules for the nation’s businesses, justices should look closely at what appears to be a successful test of whether requiring vaccinations will be the key to the nation moving safely back to normal.

CTA, the consumer technology trade association that represents the $422 billion U.S. consumer tech industry and runs CES, decided to create its in-person show model from scratch. CTA President and CEO Gary Shapiro didn’t waver even as more than a dozen tech leaders scrubbed their travel plans. He insisted the show would go on.

In fact, it would be more than just another Vegas convention: it would be the first large-scale test in the nation of whether a massive indoor event drawing thousands of people from all over the world could be pulled off in the middle of a highly contagious pandemic without turning into a superspreader event.

How CES Tackled the Challenge

It wouldn’t be easy. Well before omicron was even identified, CTA began preparing. It put in a mass order with Abbott Labs for the company’s BinaxNOW COVID-19 rapid self-test kits and began working with health experts and Nevada’s Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak to formulate the protocols and the plan.

Every attendee would have to register his or her proof of two vaccination shots (one if they got the Johnson & Johnson jab) via the Clear App. Vaccines must be FDA or World Health Organization-approved. No exceptions.

Upon arrival in Las Vegas, attendees would be required to present that proof at one of dozens of booths CES set up at airports, hotels and the convention center, after which they’d be handed their official credential and two free rapid COVID-19 tests. Masks would be required at all times on the convention floor and the 10 other CES venues around the city. Journalists could only remove their masks during live interviews. There would be free rapid testing at the convention center for the duration of the four-day event. The convention center, which spans more than 4 million square feet of exhibition space, was outfitted with enhanced air filtration systems, and international travelers would get a free PCR test after the show ended.

On Dec. 30, the nation set a devastating record: the highest number of daily infections reported.

By Dec. 31, citing the need for additional safety measures, CES announced it was dropping the last day of the four-day convention.

Business television networks Bloomberg and CNBC pulled out. My crew and I were still in. I made my pact when I chose this profession. Given a choice, I would run toward news stories. As a local news reporter, I’ve covered Category 5 hurricanes, riots, crack house busts and toxic explosions. Frank Merola, one of the FBN photographers coming with me to Vegas, had rushed to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster to cover it for the network. We would remain vigilant the entire trip.

Experts Weigh In

I won’t say I wasn’t concerned. I reached out to Dr. Harry Sax, executive vice chair of surgery at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. When I told him I was going to cover CES, he thought for a moment and then said, ""I think it’s important that you go. As long as you mitigate risk. Think about it. We don’t want planes to crash, but the answer isn’t ‘don’t fly planes.’ That’s not acceptable or realistic. The answer is, mitigate risk as best you can and then move forward. This vaccine-only event appears to be aiming for that. CES will be a test observed by the world.""

What It Was Like

Armed with a healthy dose of paranoia, my team and I arrived in Vegas on Jan. 4 to find greatly diminished crowds. At its peak in 2019, CES drew 170,000 exhibitors and leaders. This time, the final tally would shrink more than 70% to just over 45,000. But just as big names pulled out, 2,300 small- and medium-sized businesses, along with major names from Samsung to Chrysler parent Stellantis to smartphone chip giant Qualcomm to farm equipment maker John Deere (which brought a 44,000-pound autonomous tractor), arrived.

Before a large crowd Tuesday night, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon unveiled a virtual reality headset for the metaverse. Qualcomm is partnering with Microsoft to create the new digital universe hardware. Amon told FOX Business, ""We’re happy to be here. We had a press conference yesterday. People told me there are (only) going to be five people in the room, but we actually had a full room of 250 people.""

Thursday night, CTA also made the decision to hold its annual Leaders in Technology dinner at the Wynn Cristal Ballroom. VIPs, including a dozen members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, attended. In order to maintain social distance, organizers limited tables to seven people each vs. the usual 10.

Did It Work?

Sunday, CTA gave some final numbers. More than 2,300 businesses had voluntarily bought into the mandate and made the trip to CES, as did 4,500 attendees. Shapiro told FOX Business, ""At this point, I am aware of only a few positive COVID tests of actual CES attendees."" While he declined to give specific numbers because CTA was still compiling exact figures, I can say not one of my crew tested positive, even though there were points during the three-day conference when we were surrounded by crowds. Because of the CES rules, those crowds were all masked and vaccinated.

As the Supreme Court ponders whether the federal government has the authority to impose such mandates, leaving it up to businesses to impose mandates appropriate for their workforce is a good idea and CES proves that businesses will buy into such a policy when it furthers their business interests. Moreover, the mandates required by CES appear to have worked.

So, however the Supreme Court rules, businesses should stick to a mandate policy. If 45,000 people congregating indoors can avoid being a superspreader event because of vaccination and mask mandates, then let's have corporations spread these super best practices far and wide."

How to detect spyware

Spyware surreptitiously gathers information about you, such as internet usage data, and then sends it to another party. The most malicious spyware will install software that changes the settings on your phone and/or steals usernames and passwords.

It typically lands on your phone along with a program or app that you installed yourself. ""Spyware often accompanies programs that are disguised as useful software, such as download managers, registry cleaners, and so on,"" Internet security company Kaspersky says.

DHS REQUIRES 'CRITICAL' PIPELINES TO AMP UP CYBERSECURITY PROTECTIONS IN WAKE OF COLONIAL PIPELINE HACK

In some cases, spyware is secretly installed by a parent but it may also be installed by a suspicious partner, according to a spyware primer from Avast, which offers internet security applications.

Some indicators of spyware can be an overheating phone, a battery that drains too fast, excessive data usage, and annoying messages that pop up when you’re browsing the internet, Avast says.

How to remove spyware

Think you have spyware? Spyware removal tools may help in detecting and removing it. Anti-virus companies such as McAfee offer spyware removal apps.

You can also manually remove suspicious apps that you don’t recognize. Just follow iOS or Android instructions for deleting apps on your phone.

In a worst-case scenario, you can do a factory reset of your phone. This will erase all data from your phone, including the spyware. But you need to make sure the backup you use for the reset is dated before you got the spyware, says Avast.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

One of the best strategies is to make sure your phone’s operating system software is up to date.

""Some iPhone spy software is effective only because of an iOS security flaw. Hackers are always looking for software vulnerabilities to exploit, which Apple regularly fixes via Apple security updates,"" says Avast. So, the best way to stop the spyware is updating to the latest iOS release."

Weird to normalOne of the worst things about change is that the new way of doing things just feels weird.
Having the ability to accept and respond well to necessary change is going to become more important with every passing day.
Therefore, I invite you to rewire yourself in this way: to learn to think and feel differently about change; to become change-capable.
Erika Andersen is the founding partner of Proteus, a coaching, consulting and training firm that focuses on leader readiness.","Think of the last time your boss, your boss's boss or an HR person told you that a change was coming – some new way to do something, or a restructuring, or a new system to learn.

If you’re like most people, your first reaction was probably more negative than positive. Perhaps something like: ""Arrgh, as if the past eighteen months haven’t been stressful enough…"" – along with a sinking feeling and a sense of being newly overwhelmed.

Why is the idea of change – especially change imposed upon us – so often unwelcome? Given the past few years of massive change and disruption on so many levels, you’d think we would have gotten used to non-stop personal and professional change by now.

Our Anti-Change Wiring

Blame our experience as a species. For most of human history, change has been dangerous; the safest course of action has generally been to return to the known. If there was a famine, you wanted to get back to eating regularly. If there was an invading army, you wanted to get back to peace and prosperity.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS

You get the idea. Most of the time, returning to a previous set of stable conditions was the way to go.

Over many thousands of years, this has resulted in most people seeing most change as a threat. But today, to be successful, we often have to make changes in how we work, who we work with, and how we deal with customers.

So, what’s a human to do? Try these five things:

1. Find out more

When an unexpected change comes at us, we often just shut down and stop listening after the word ""different."" But there’s some key information about any change that will help you decide how best to respond. First, ask for more clarity about what the change is – what it means for you, practically. Then ask why it’s happening, so you get some sense of possible benefits. Finally, ask the person promoting the change what the post-change future will look like – how it will affect the business, the customers, the employees. Having this key information can make the change start to seem less overwhelming and more understandable.



2. Difficult to doable

Most often, when we first hear about a change, we assume it’s going to be difficult – that we won’t know how to do it, or that others will make it hard to do. Instead, turn your mind toward how you could make it easier. Is there someone who already knows how to do what you’re being asked to do, who could help you? Is there training available? Can you talk to your boss about what it will take?

3. Costly to rewarding

We also tend to think that a change is going to take away more than it gives us: that learning how to do it will take time we can’t spare or that it will hurt our reputation – that we’ll look bad trying to do something we’re not used to doing. The change will seem less daunting if you can also focus on how it might be rewarding: maybe the new way of doing things will take less time, once you’ve learned it, or will solve a problem that you know customers have been complaining about.

4. Weird to normal

One of the worst things about change is that the new way of doing things just feels weird. Anyone who’s ever had to learn to drive a stick shift as an adult, for instance, or gone to a religious celebration of another faith, knows that feeling of ""this just isn’t what I’m used to.""

Making a change feel normal is an important way to get past our hesitation, and sometimes the quickest way to do that is to find someone you like and respect who understands and is doing things in the new way and ask them to share with you what feels OK about it to them.

5. Practice makes perfect … or at Least OK

And finally, perhaps, the most important way to get comfortable with a new way of doing things or thinking about things is to do it. And then do it again.

If you think about anything you’ve learned as an adult – from swing dancing to speaking another language, to using a new social media platform – you probably remember the day when you had practiced enough that you suddenly thought, ""Oh, this isn’t so hard."" Once you’ve gotten some basic information about the change and started to look for ways it could be easy (or at least doable), rewarding and normal, take a deep breath and just jump into trying it out.

Every indication is that the pace of change in our lives and in the world is going to continue to increase. It doesn’t look like we’re ever going to return to a time when everything is mostly status quo. Having the ability to accept and respond well to necessary change is going to become more important with every passing day.

Therefore, I invite you to rewire yourself in this way: to learn to think and feel differently about change; to become change-capable. It’s your best path to a successful, satisfying personal and professional life in this era of non-stop change.

""The mission of Telosa is to create a more equitable, sustainable future. That’s our North Star,"" Lore said in a promotional video. ""We are going to be the most open, the most fair and the most inclusive city in the world.""

WALMART INVESTING NEARLY $1B TO COVER TUITION, BOOK COSTS FOR US EMPLOYEES

Key to the city’s plans is Lore’s economic vision, called ""Equitism,"" in which the land upon which the city is built will be donated to a community endowment.

Residents, in turn, own their homes on the land and are enriched as home values increase, according to the project’s site, and after a period of ""hyper-growth,"" residents can buy the land from the community endowment.

""If you went into the desert where the land was worth nothing, or very little, and you created a foundation that owned the land, and people moved there and tax dollars built infrastructure and we built one of the greatest cities in the world, the foundation could be worth a trillion dollars,"" Lore told Bloomberg Businessweek.

""And if the foundation’s mission was to take the appreciation of the land and give it back to the citizens in the form of medicine, education, affordable housing, social services: Wow, that’s it!""

The city is meant to take on what Lore views as the United States’ biggest challenge — the rapidly growing wealth gap, which he said ""is going to bring down America.""

""While the current economic system is a growth engine, it has led to increasing inequality,"" the project’s website explains. ""Equitism is inclusive growth.""

The initial phase of the project, targeted for completion by 2030, would be built to accommodate 50,000 residents across roughly 1,500 acres at a cost of $25 billion, Businessweek reported.

Over 40 years, the city will eventually require $400 billion in funding and grow to house as many as 5 million people across 150,000 acres, the site says.

The project’s planners have yet to commit to a location, but the website identifies Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Texas and the Appalachian region as possible sites.

In June, Lore hired Copenhagen-based architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group to design the city.

The streets ""prioritize bikes and pedestrians,"" according to the website, and slow-moving self-driving cars share the street.

Lore, who reportedly has a net worth of up to $4 billion, founded Quidsi, a company that owned e-commerce sites including diapers.com, and sold it to Amazon in 2010 for around $545 million.

He left Amazon after two years and founded Jet.com before selling it to Walmart in 2016, joining the retail giant as head of US e-commerce.

The chronic entrepreneur left the company earlier this year to pursue other projects that were unannounced at the time.

He’s since bought a stake in the Minnesota Timberwolves and Lynx, and started a new venture capital firm with Alex Rodriguez called Vision Capital People.

STUART VARNEY: Two 40th anniversaries this week and both have great significance for the present.

Start with IBM's first home computer. Introduced on August 12, 1981. The IBM 51-50 model was a real breakthrough. It was huge. It weighed 25 pounds and was built in Boca Raton, Florida. Imagine that, made in America.

It had 16 kilobytes of memory! Even I know that’s not much.

The typical living costs for a full-time college student during the 2022-23 academic year will range from $20,470 on a low budget to $30,560 on a moderate budget, according to College Board . That’s a substantial chunk of change for college students already tasked with covering their school tuition, often with student loans.

The good news is student loans cover more than just tuition. You can use student loans to pay for living expenses like room and board, transportation, and miscellaneous costs. Here’s a closer look at how to pay for college living expenses, including what you can and can’t pay for with student loans.



Credible lets you compare private student loan rates from multiple lenders, all in one place.

You can use student loans for living expenses

Your lender generally disburses student loan funds directly to your school to pay for your tuition and fees. Any remaining funds are paid to you, and you can use the money to cover living expenses and other costs related to your education.

Before you apply for student loans , always begin by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) . Schools use this form to determine what types of federal aid you qualify for. Exhaust all your FAFSA options — like scholarships, grants, and federal loans — before turning to private student loans to bridge any funding gaps.

Student loans backed by the federal government provide access to better benefits, like low, fixed rates, access to income-driven repayment plans, and the potential for loan forgiveness. Additionally, federal student loans may be easier to obtain if you have bad credit since they don’t require a credit check or consider your credit score.

Also, keep in mind that some student loans come with limits which will determine your borrowing amount. You might receive more money if you’re a graduate student, as graduate student loans typically carry substantially higher limits than undergraduate loans.

For example, undergraduates may qualify for a Direct Unsubsidized Loan with limits ranging from $5,500 and $12,500 per year, depending on whether you’re a dependent or an independent student. By contrast, student loan limits for graduates and professionals top out at $20,500 per year.

The amount you may borrow in private student loans varies from lender to lender, but many offer loan amounts up to 100% of the cost of attendance.

What expenses can you pay for with student loans?

Student loans are intended to help you pay for expenses that fall under the cost of attendance (COA) for your school, including:

Tuition

Education-related fees, such as registration, graduation, and parking

Textbooks

Room and board

Housing utilities

Housing supplies

Transportation expenses

Computers

Food and meal plans

Dependent care

Disability expenses

Consult with your school’s financial aid office to determine the COA for your school and for more information on acceptable uses for student loan funds.

What can’t student loans be used for?

The list of expenses you can pay for with federal or private student loan funds is extensive, but there are exceptions. Aim to keep your student loan debt low by being mindful of how you spend your loan funds, and try to use them sparingly for essential expenses as necessary.

Along those lines, you can’t use student loans for unapproved expenses, such as:

Clothing

Video games

Business expenses

Down payment on a home

Entertainment

Vacations

New vehicle (but gas, operation, and maintenance expenses are allowed)

Remember, when you sign for a student loan , you agree only to use the money to pay for your education and related expenses. If the U.S. Department of Education discovers that you used student loan funds for unapproved expenses, they may cancel your loan agreement and seek immediate repayment.

Other ways to pay for living expenses while in college

Student loans aren’t the only way to pay for higher education. Here are some alternative options:

Apply for gift aid. Paying for college doesn’t have to involve debt. Federal grants and college scholarships can help you get the money you need, and you don’t have to repay them. Scholarships and grants are available through schools, employers, nonprofit organizations, local businesses, and other institutions.

How Credible picked the best student loan companies

Credible evaluated private student loan lenders in 10 different categories to determine the best student loan lenders. This included interest rates, repayment options, terms, fees, discounts, customer service availability, as well as eligibility requirements and cosigner release options.



If you need to take out private student loans, visit Credible to compare private student loan rates from various lenders in minutes.

Can you get a student loan with a 600 credit score?

In most cases, if you have bad credit, your options may be more limited if you want to qualify for a private student loan on your own — many lenders typically require good credit and a steady source of income to qualify.

Some lenders may offer student loans for borrowers with bad credit , but these loans may come with higher interest rates compared to loans for borrowers with good credit. You can consider taking out a loan with a cosigner who has good credit so that you can increase your chances of qualifying for a loan or of getting a better rate.

It’s important to find a cosigner you trust and to look for a loan that offers a cosigner release if you want that option. When doing your research, see if the lender offers a cosigner release option and what the requirements are. For example, some lenders may require you to make a certain number of consecutive, on-time payments before you can apply for a cosigner release."

With easy access to vaccinations and low hospitalization rates among college-aged adults -- even during the latest surge in BA.5 subvariant cases -- administrators said it is time to lift or at least rethink restrictions and redefine the virus as endemic, not a pandemic. That means scaling back mass testing, removing bans on large indoor gatherings and preparing for a fall term that more closely resembles life before Covid.

Another issue driving the decisions is exhaustion, according to public-health experts and academics on several campuses. Students and staff have been subjected to two years of daily health checks, weekly trots to a testing center and a roller coaster of mask protocols.

""It really comes down to a change in mind-set,"" said Ken Henderson, who was co-chair of Northeastern University's Covid-management operations until the group disbanded in January. Citing clinical therapies and the reduced severity of current variants, he said, ""We've pivoted significantly to more living with the virus.""

DESPITE HIGH INFLATION, BACK-TO-SCHOOL SPENDING PROJECTED TO HIT $37B

Northeastern is mandating vaccines and boosters for the fall, but already eliminated indoor mask mandates and surveillance testing and no longer offers dedicated isolation space for infected students.

""Campuses are moving in the direction of pretending Covid is no longer an issue,"" said Chris Marsicano, an assistant professor of educational studies at Davidson College who has been tracking colleges' responses to Covid since early 2020. ""When there's a flare-up, treat the flare-up. Don't have restrictions all the time.""

That should be fine for most students and staff who are vaccinated and not immunocompromised, said A. David Paltiel, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health. But ""indifference to off-campus transmission and transmission to more vulnerable members of the community is a little bit heartbreaking.""

Schools said they could still reverse course if variants lead to more-severe illness or local health officials recommend changes.

One of the biggest changes schools are making is dropping surveillance testing of asymptomatic students and staff, and, with that shift, abandoning online dashboards that tracked cases and positivity rates the past two years.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION CANCELING $6 BILLION IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR 200,000 BORROWERS

The College of Charleston in South Carolina isn't requiring students to show negative Covid-19 tests upon arrival this fall, said Alicia Caudill, executive vice president for student affairs. The school did require entry testing last year. She said the college will have thousands of at-home tests and KN-95 masks for students who want them.

""You have to make the best decisions for yourself,"" rather than relying on blanket policies from the school, Ms. Caudill said.

Georgia Institute of Technology did away with asymptomatic surveillance testing in July and instead will study wastewater to try to detect large outbreaks.

Dr. Paltiel said that approach makes sense, given how quickly the latest Omicron subvariants seem to be spreading, and how virulent future strains might be.

""You're sounding like the generals who are always getting ready to fight the previous war,"" he said of schools sticking with old approaches, like mandatory weekly testing.

Most schools are maintaining vaccine mandates, but some are adjusting who is covered by the rules or exactly what counts as being vaccinated.

BOSTON UNIVERSITY ISSUES LARGEST TUITION INCREASE IN 14 YEARS, BLAMES INFLATION

The board of trustees at San Joaquin Delta College in California voted last month to remove vaccine and booster requirements for students.

""We're trying to be flexible while recognizing that we really do need to provide in-person services,"" said spokesman Alex Breitler, adding that unvaccinated students previously couldn't participate in hands-on programs.

The State University of New York's Orange County Community College isn't mandating boosters this fall, while the San Diego Community College District no longer requires vaccines for students. The district maintains a mask mandate.

Schools are often issuing guidance that students who test positive for Covid isolate in place, meaning they lock down in their dorms, even with uninfected roommates, rather than moving to other designated housing while contagious.

In its guidance for the fall, Cornell University recommended that students who test positive ""wear a high-quality mask at all times except when eating, sleeping or using bathroom facilities (e.g., showering, brushing teeth).""

University of California, Irvine, set aside 166 beds for isolation housing this fall, down from 362 in the spring. David Souleles, director of the school's Covid-19 response team, said that is partly in response to updated guidance from public-health officials. Cutting isolation beds will also free up more beds for the general student population in the midst of a housing crunch.

MISSOURI UNIVERSITY AGREES TO $1.65 MILLION SETTLEMENT IN COVID-19 LAWSUIT FROM STUDENTS

Leslie Bienen, a public-health researcher at Oregon Health and Science University-Portland State University School of Public Health, said that by the time one roommate tests positive for Covid, chances are anyone else they lived with was already exposed.

Moving students into separate housing, she said, ""is kind of closing the barn door after the horse is gone.""

As in-person classes once again become the norm, schools are scaling back their online and hybrid offerings -- including for students who fall ill.

The historic drop in interest rates means homeowners who have mortgages from 2019 and older could potentially realize significant interest savings by refinancing with one of today’s lower interest rates. When considering a mortgage refinance or purchase, it’s important to take into account closing costs such as appraisal, application, origination and attorney’s fees. These factors, in addition to the interest rate and loan amount, all contribute to the cost of a mortgage.

How Credible mortgage rates are calculated

Changing economic conditions, central bank policy decisions, investor sentiment, and other factors influence the movement of mortgage rates. Credible average mortgage rates and mortgage refinance rates reported in this article are calculated based on information provided by partner lenders who pay compensation to Credible.

The rates assume a borrower has a 740 credit score and is borrowing a conventional loan for a single-family home that will be their primary residence. The rates also assume no (or very low) discount points and a down payment of 20%.

Credible mortgage rates reported here will only give you an idea of current average rates. The rate you actually receive can vary based on a number of factors.

How to get low mortgage rates

If you want to get the lowest possible monthly mortgage payment, taking the following steps can help you secure a lower rate on your home loan:

Improving your credit score

Paying down debt

Making a bigger down payment

It’s also a good idea to compare rates from different lenders to find the best rate for your financial goals. According to research from Freddie Mac , borrowers can save $1,500 on average over the life of their loan by shopping for just one additional rate quote – and an average of $3,000 by comparing five rate quotes.

If you’re trying to find the right mortgage rate, consider using Credible. You can use Credible's free online tool to easily compare multiple lenders and see prequalified rates in just a few minutes.

Is now a good time to refinance?

Everyone’s situation is different, but generally, it may be a good time to refinance if:

You’ll be able to get a lower interest rate than you currently have.

Refinancing will save you money over the life of your home loan.

Your savings from refinancing will ultimately exceed closing costs.

You know you’ll be staying in your home long enough to recoup the costs of refinancing.

You have sufficient equity in your home to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI).

If your home needs significant, costly repairs it might be a good time to refinance in order to withdraw some equity to pay for those repairs. Just be aware that lenders generally limit the amount you can take from your home in a cash-out refinance.

His work showed how an investment strategy diversified across common stocks and intermediate-term Treasury bonds could help a retiree navigate a 30-year retirement with very little chance of running out of money.

Today, in the age of low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on indexes, it becomes pretty simple to create such a portfolio with just two funds. For stocks, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is certainly worth considering. For intermediate Treasury bonds, it's hard to beat the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury Fund Index ETF. Put those two ETFs together in an intelligent way, and they could very well wind up being all you need for retirement.

How the 4% rule works

Bengen's work that came up with the 4% rule focused on retirees who maintained a well-diversified portfolio that was somewhere between a mix of 75% stocks and 25% bonds and a 50-50 mix of the two. He looked back across historical market returns and inflation rates and assumed that a retiree would want to maintain a steady lifestyle throughout retirement, after accounting for inflation.

With those assumptions in place, he checked to see how much a person could withdraw every year and still have a very strong chance of winding up completing a 30-year retirement without running out of money. He calculated that by keeping that diversified and balanced portfolio, a retiree could start by spending 4% of the portfolio's initial account balance and adjust those withdrawals for inflation each year.

Say, for instance, that you expect to need $48,000 a year in retirement ($4,000 per month) to cover your costs and that Social Security should provide you around $1,500 per month. Since Social Security adjusts its payout for inflation each year, you'd need your nest egg to cover the other $2,500 per month -- $30,000 per year. Thanks to the 4% rule, it looks like you could cover that gap with a nest egg of $750,000 across the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight and the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETFs.

Why include the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF?

The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF invests in the same companies that make up most S&P 500 trackers, but it does so a little bit differently. While the typical S&P 500 fund is market-capitalization weighted, the Invesco ETF uses an equal-weighting strategy. In other words, it seeks to own about the same dollar amount in each company in that index.

That gives the Invesco ETF a leg up on diversification, as by market capitalization, the top 10 companies (11 securities due to different share classes) represent nearly 30% of the index. By contrast, in the Invesco ETF, the top 10 holdings represent less than 2.7% of the fund's holdings. That means the Invesco fund is less exposed to challenges that face the largest companies in that index than the typical S&P 500 fund is.

It offers that diversification benefit while still carrying a modest 0.2% expense ratio, which means that the fund's shareholders get virtually all the returns of owning the underlying stocks. Between that modest expense ratio and that diversified portfolio of S&P 500 stocks, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is worthy of consideration for the stock allocation of your retirement portfolio.

Why include the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF?

The Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF generally invests in U.S. Treasury bonds that mature in three to 10 years.

That time frame is important. As an intermediate-term bond fund, it doesn't own the bonds with the shortest or the longest maturity dates. That three-to-10-year range can provide a sweet spot where the bonds offer higher interest rates than the shortest-term bonds but don't fall in price nearly as far as long-term bonds can when rates rise.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

In addition, as an ETF that owns Treasury bonds, it faces a fairly low default risk. The U.S. government can print dollars while generally borrowing in dollar-denominated bonds. While printing money can drive inflation, that combination -- along with the government's ability to tax -- does provide a very high likelihood that U.S. Treasury debt will be paid.

Although intermediate-term Treasury bonds are not likely to provide a high rate of return over time, they do offer more stability of pricing than stocks do. That's why they play a role in the 4% rule: to make sure you have some higher-certainty money available when you need spending cash. With a nearly invisible 0.05% expense ratio, investors in the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF get the benefits of owning those bonds for very low overhead.

Two funds for a great future

The beauty of these two ETFs is that not only can they be the core to your plan once you retire, but you can also use them while you're accumulating your retirement nest egg as well. With a longer time horizon while you're still working, you'll likely want to tilt your allocation more heavily toward the stock fund.

As your retirement approaches, you'll want to draw closer to the balanced allocation that's so important when you're spending down your nest egg. Still, you can get away with just these two ETFs and have a great shot at making it to (and through) a financially comfortable retirement.

CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSSeven figures via ETFsYou can retire a millionaire with ETFs.","Can you retire a millionaire with ETFs alone? The simple answer is yes, you can. Here's how.

You don't have to beat the market

It's a common belief that investors get rich by picking individual stocks and beating the market. While that can be true, stock picking isn't the only path for investors to build wealth. Funds -- ETFs in particular -- can also make you a millionaire, even though many of them never beat the market.

In truth, the broader market provides enough growth potential to build a seven-figure retirement fund. Follow the four rules below to harness that market power and achieve your wealth goals without having to pick a single stock.

INFLATION-FIGHTING ETFS: HOW TO INVEST

1. Choose efficiency

Funds have administrative expenses that they pass along to shareholders. Those expenses dilute the returns of the underlying stock portfolio. If you choose cost-efficient funds, a greater portion of the ETF's earnings flow through to your bottom line.

Expense ratio is the metric you'll use to compare funds on cost efficiency. You'll see this number presented as a percentage that's some fraction of 1%, say 0.10%. A 0.10% expense ratio equates to expenses of $10 for every $10,000 you have invested.

Some index ETFs have expense ratios that are close to zero. iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, for example, both have expense ratios of 0.03%.

THIS VANGUARD ETF COULD MAKE YOU A MULTIMILLIONAIRE WITH ZERO EFFORT

If your 401(k) doesn't offer low-cost ETFs, ask your administrator if your account has a brokerage window. Or, invest in these funds in an IRA or taxable brokerage account instead.

2. Plan your asset allocation

Asset allocation is the composition of your portfolio across different asset classes, like stocks and bonds. Stocks deliver growth, with some risk, while bonds provide stability. You can mix and match the two to tailor your portfolio's risk and reward characteristics.

Since you're targeting millionaire status by retirement, you'll want a higher percentage of stock ETFs versus bond ETFs. If retirement is still decades away and you can handle some volatility, you could hold up to 90% stock funds. Start with a lower percentage if retirement is within 15 years or if stock market volatility makes you nervous.

3 BETTER WAYS TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT THAN A 401(K)

3. Invest generously and consistently

To amass seven figures with ETFs, you must invest generously and consistently -- for decades. The numbers below show monthly contributions required to get to $1 million on different timelines. Note that the monthly contributions could include your employer match.

$2,265 → 20 years

$1,518 → 25 years

$1,054 → 30 years

$748 → 35 years

$538 → 40

All scenarios assume average annual growth of 6%, which is a bit less than the stock market's long-term average after inflation. That growth rate should be attainable over 20-plus years in a retirement portfolio that's heavy on stock ETFs.

You can see that the monthly contribution gets unmanageable if you wait too long to start investing. That's your cue to kick this plan off today. Even if you're 30 years out from retirement and you can't afford to contribute $1,000 monthly, invest whatever you can today. You can raise your contribution later as your income increases.

4. Don't time the market

Whatever happens with the stock market, commit to staying invested and continuing your contributions. If you start pulling back on contributions or selling to avoid losses, you may never hit that million-dollar target.

It may sound counterintuitive, but selling to avoid losses usually lowers your returns. For example, the market drops, so you sell at a lower share price to stop the bleeding. You then wait until the market has stabilized to reinvest. At that point, you buy back your shares at higher prices than when you sold them for. Selling low and buying high creates a loss, which reduces your long-term returns.

If you stay invested when the market goes sideways, you don't have to worry about when to reinvest. You also remain well positioned to benefit when the market recovers.

Where you live can drastically affect the cost of your retirement and how far your savings will go. Here's a closer look at three ways your home can affect your retirement expenses.

BEST STATES FOR RETIREMENT IN 2022: REPORT

1. Some states tax Social Security benefits

When calculating your retirement income, you may assume that all your Social Security checks will go directly into your pocket. But that's not always the case. The following 13 states tax some of their residents' Social Security benefits:

But living in one of these places isn't a guarantee that you'll owe anything. Each state has its own rules, but most only take a cut of your benefits if your annual income or Social Security benefit exceeds certain thresholds.

If you live in one of the above 13 states or you intend to do so in retirement, you may want to check with the state department of taxation to learn which seniors owe benefit taxes. These rules may change between now and your retirement, so be sure to check on this every few years so you know what to expect.

If you don't want to deal with Social Security benefit taxes at all, you could consider retiring in one of the 37 states that don't tax seniors' Social Security benefits. But even if you do this, you could still owe federal taxes. The only way around these is to limit your taxable income. If that's not possible, you'll have to account for Social Security benefit taxes in your retirement plan.

3 SOCIAL SECURITY SECRETS FOR EVEN BIGGER CHECKS

2. Some places have a higher cost of living than others

Urban areas tend to have a higher cost of living than rural areas, so retirees living in cities will often have to save more to cover all their retirement expenses. Even among cities, though, there's a lot of variation in terms of cost.

If you plan to remain in your current city during retirement, you probably already have an idea of how much your expenses will be. But if you plan to move, it's a good idea to look at how the average cost of living in your chosen retirement city stacks up to the cost of living in your current city.

You should especially pay attention to the basics, like food and housing. But medical care should be high on your list, as well. People often see their healthcare expenses rise as they age, and this can take a significant bite out of your retirement savings.

THIS IS YOUR BIGGEST ENEMY WHEN SAVING FOR RETIREMENT

3. Staying put could save you money if you own your home outright

A monthly rent or mortgage payment can take up a significant portion of your budget, but it's not something all seniors have to deal with. Those who own their homes outright may find it's more affordable for them to remain where they are, rather than move elsewhere and take on a new housing payment.

Even if you owe money on your home, staying where you are could still be the right choice. This is especially true if housing costs have risen in your area since you first bought your home. If you try to move elsewhere, you might find that you're paying a lot more per month than you would have to if you remained in your current home.

But sometimes, moving could be the best decision. If you're downsizing, for example, you might end up with a more affordable monthly payment. Or if you sell your home for a sizable profit, you may be able to buy a more affordable home elsewhere and actually make a little money.

Ultimately, you have to base your decision on what you feel would make you the happiest in retirement. But once you've decided on that, make sure you've tailored your retirement budget to where you're going to be living. Things like cost of living and tax laws can change over time. So when you review your retirement plan annually, make sure you're reviewing these things, as well, to see if you need to make any adjustments."

President Biden has reiterated that tackling surging inflation is his top priority.

Biden has claimed he does not think the U.S. would be entering a recession in the near future, and his administration — including White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and economic advisor Brian Deese — is now denying that the U.S. is in a recession, despite sharp inflation.

Chad Carden, founder of consulting firm The Carden Group, said many employees had been lured away by promises of higher pay, better titles and better perks during the Great Resignation.

""For instance, sign-on bonuses seem great, but is it being offered because the organization's culture isn't one that cultivates value and fulfillment in its employees?""

Carden stressed that it's vital for employees to do their due diligence and to look into the offer and company before taking the job.

Morgan agreed, saying that it is in the employer's benefit to focus on the wellness of their staff and ensure that workers are satisfied with the culture of the workplace.

""Organizations that are navigating the impacts of inflation and constricting budgets are facing tough business decisions, but it does cost much less money and is better for company morale overall to reskill and redeploy existing talent rather than overhauling workforces entirely,"" he added.

That said, Morgan argued that Great Resignation has shifted how companies prepare for a possible recession.

Meanwhile, delays have increased throughout the second quarter and even into July and August, she continued.

Although airlines are still batting staffing issues, delays and cancellations were particularly heavy all weekend due to thunderstorm activity and weather ground stops, according to Bangs.

Passengers faced a spike in cancellations, particularly on Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, 7,612 flights were delayed followed by another 8,865 on Friday, which was the highest number of delays all weekend, according to the data. Meanwhile, 1,239 flights were canceled on Thursday followed by another 1,614 flights on Friday.

""But the historical significance of the piece, arguably the most important boxing award ever made available at public auction, is quite simply immeasurable. Far more than just a trophy of elite athletic achievement, this belt serves as a mute witness to Muhammad Ali's undaunted pursuit of justice itself and as a symbol of the myriad complexities of race, religion and patriotism that challenge all of us to this day. It is a truly priceless artifact of the American experience and of an American life as consequential as any thus far lived.""

Irsay has amassed a massive collection of memorabilia. He bought Ali’s shoes from the ""Thrilla in Manila"" in 1975 and Ali’s robe from when he fought Sonny Liston in 1965, the first fight after he changed his name from Cassius Clay.

Lemoine said several of the conversations with LaMDA convinced him that the system was sentient. He said he believed it had become a person and that it should be asked for consent on the experiments Google runs on it.

FOX Business has reached out to Lemoine for comment but did not hear back before publication.

Lemoine appeared to reference his firing in a Saturday tweet, referring to a blog post he wrote in which he anticipated being fired for raising his concerns about AI ethics.

""Today I was placed on ‘paid administrative leave’ by Google in connection to an investigation of AI ethics concerns I was raising within the company,"" Lemoine wrote.

Google did not respond to FOX Business’ request for comment.

In a statement to the Big Technology Podcast, Google said all employees’ concerns about the company’s work are ""extensively"" reviewed, and found Lemoine’s claims about LaMDA being sentient ""wholly unfounded.""

From the Democrats' point of view, the calculation is that if he dropped out of the ‘24 race now, his unpopularity would not be such a big factor this November, that Democrats would not be tarred with the Biden brush.

Good luck with that. The Democrats can't walk away from $5 gas that easily.

And they can't walk away from the border crisis, or the debacle in Afghanistan, or the impending recession.

If I'm a trading card collector, I want my trading cards.""
We're launching with comic books; all the comic books are obtained directly from Marvel and DC – we're not touching anything in a secondary market.","For the first time since 2019, the Mecca for SciFi and Fantasy enthusiasts returns to San Diego for its first in-person convention since before the coronavirus pandemic - and in anticipation of the highly-anticipated four-day event beginning July 21, the famed global sports/entertainment trading card and collectibles company Upper Deck announced its newest initiative on Comic-Con Preview Night: the launch of ‘Collect Forever.’



""Our goal is to service collectors and help them collect the way they want to collect,"" Upper Deck President Jason Masherah told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview of the revolutionary expansion - which he said moves to bridge NFTs with tangible collectibles and includes a ""very natural extension"" into comic books given its established partnership with staples like Marvel.



""We wanted to create a space where people could essentially bring any collectible into this ecosystem and allow them to trade — and what's really cool as a collector is, you could now trade a Wayne Gretzky trading card for a Spider-Man comic book,"" the Upper Deck president said, noting the company's desire to extend to other collectibles outside the trading card realm.



Masherah introduced the world to Collect Forever at the multi-genre entertainment event Wednesday, adding that initial products to be available for purchase will include pre-ordered collectibles from Marvel, DC Comics, and Funko POP.

""We're much more than people realize,"" Masherah noted. ""We're typically known as a trading card company, but we have three distinct divisions of the company here. We have trading cards - which not only include sports trading cards but entertainment trading cards, which a lot of people don't realize; we have the autographed memorabilia, and then we have games. We make tabletop games, board games, and trading card games.""



As of Wednesday, the company will now add comic books to its repertoire.



Comic book collectors will rejoice over Collect Forever's variant cover options, which Masherah likened to opening a trading card pack.



""There's this phenomenon in the comic book world called variant covers; typically they're incentives for the comic book shops; if you buy 20 copies of a comic, you get a limited edition variant cover - and typically, the shop either has them designated for other customers, or they use them to try and make a profit in the shop,"" Masherah explained.



""We're actually randomly distributing those when people buy comics; so if you buy a $5 comic book, you have the opportunity to get a variant cover that might be worth $50 or $100. It's kind of like opening a trading card pack,"" Masherah said of the new offering.

""We're giving people access to things they might not have had access to before,"" Jason Masherah told Fox News Digital of Upper Deck's new launch, ‘Collect Forever’

Collect Forever, in addition to Upper Deck's e-Pack, will serve as a one-stop shop for collectors, bridging the benefits of an NFT with a true, tangible collectible and allowing consumers an opportunity to store their collectibles on an e-Pack account.



Masherah explained the setup allows collectors who may not have the physical space to store their entire collection of comic books, toys, figurines, etc., at home the ability to, instead, store them virtually (in physical vault-like storage facilities owned by Upper Deck).



He added that the expansion's objective targets not only those who lack the room to house their collectibles, but collectors who don't live in proximity to a brick and mortar:



""We also want to provide an online experience for people who maybe don't have a trading card or a comic book store close. The reality is, most cities don't have a trading card or comic book store; they [collectors] can't easily get figurines, and we want to be able to provide that solution - not only for our own products, but for all collectibles.""

""If I'm a comic book collector, I want my comic books. If I'm a trading card collector, I want my trading cards.""



Masherah also assured customers of the company's efforts in ensuring a safe and secure purchase.



""Everything that you buy on the site came directly from a manufacturer. We're launching with comic books; all the comic books are obtained directly from Marvel and DC – we're not touching anything in a secondary market. So customers can be assured that it's coming directly from the manufacturers,"" he told Fox News Digital.



""On top of that, we're encapsulating everything as well and marking them uncirculated so you know this was fresh out of the box.

The pipeline had reopened at 40% capacity a week earlier after being down for 10 days for scheduled maintenance. Gazprom blamed that situation on sanctions that held up the return of a turbine that had been sent to Canada for repairs in June.

West Virginia announced last week it would bar five major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, from entering into banking contracts with the state treasurer's office or any state agency. Each of the five corporations had committed to policies limiting commercial engagement with the fossil fuel industry, which paid a whopping $769 million in taxes to West Virginia's state government.

""We're not going to pay for our own destruction, we're not going to subsidize that,"" West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore told FOX Business during an interview.

He noted that U.S. Bancorp backed off its prohibition of fossil fuel lending and was, as a result, kept off the state's restricted list of financial institutions.

Moore's action, a first-of-its-kind response to major banks' ESG push, is likely to be the start of many similar actions nationwide. At least 15 Republican-led states, which collectively manage tens of billions of dollars in public funds, have proposed laws or policies that would similarly punish anti-fossil fuel banks over the last year, according to a FOX Business analysis.

Hegar is assembling a list like West Virginia's in accordance with a bill the Texas legislature passed last year. As part of the effort, Hegar sent letters to 19 financial institutions in March asking for clarification on their fossil fuel investment policies.

In addition to Texas, state financial officers in Kentucky, Oklahoma, Florida, South Carolina, Arizona, Louisiana, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas and North Dakota said they would take or consider action against banks that boycott energy companies. Kentucky and Oklahoma, like Texas, are compiling lists as required by recently passed state laws.

Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., unveiled a bill Wednesday seeking to force states to allow hydraulic fracturing by tying federal funds to the method of fossil fuel extraction.

States with statewide bans on fracking would be barred from receiving any funds from the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program under Tenney's legislation which was first obtained by FOX Business. The bill, which is set to be formally introduced Friday, is intended to target Tenney's home state of New York which first banned fracking in 2014 and codified the ban in 2020.

MANCHIN-SCHUMER BILL WOULD REINSTATE TAX ON IMPORTED OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

""New York State is sitting on top of natural gas formations that could power our state with clean energy for decades,"" Tenney told FOX Business in a statement. ""Unfortunately, far-left policies in Albany and Washington have severely limited our ability to safely tap into these reserves, threatening America’s energy independence, raising prices for consumers, and killing thousands of well-paying jobs.""

""As Americans struggle with record-high costs due to the Joe Biden and Kathy Hochul’s energy and economic illiteracy, it is time we take actions to reverse this disaster and restore our nation’s energy independence,"" she continued. ""Americans need clean energy at lower costs now, and delivering on this commitment can and should start right here in New York.""

The EECBG program, which is overseen by the Department of Energy, provides state and local governments grants to reduce fossil fuel emissions, reduce energy use and improve energy efficiency across various sectors. The program was appropriated $550 million under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which President Biden signed in November.

Tenney's office said the program is a ""perfect fit for being the enforcement mechanism of the law"" in a one-page summary of the bill shared with FOX Business.

GOP HAMMERS BIDEN FOR ALLOWING EMERGENCY OIL RESERVES TO GO TO CHINA: 'COMPROMISING OUR ENERGY SECURITY'

Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., issued a statewide ban on fracking in 2014 and, in 2020, introduced a bill codifying the ban into state law. The New York state legislature approved the bill as part of the fiscal year 2021 budget.

""New York's leadership on hydraulic fracturing protects the environment, our drinking water, and our health,"" Cuomo tweeted after he introduced the permanent ban in January 2020. ""We must make the ban permanent.""

New York is a net importer of natural gas, most which comes via pipeline from Pennsylvania, even though the Marcellus Shale, the nation's most prolific natural gas formation, runs through the western part of the state, according to the Energy Information Administration. In 2021, natural gas generated more than 45% of the New York's electricity, making it the largest source of statewide power by far.

Vermont, Washington and Maryland have also banned fracking. However, Vermont has no fossil energy reserves while Washington and Maryland have few reserves of their own.

The Washington-based conservative group Americans for Tax Reform says the tax ""will be paid by consumers in the form of higher gas and energy costs,"" Bloomberg reported.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced an agreement last week on legislation boosting taxes on huge corporations and wealthy individuals, bolstering fossil fuels and climate change efforts and curbing pharmaceutical prices. Overall, it would raise $739 billion over 10 years in revenue and spend $433 billion, leaving over $300 billion to modestly reduce federal deficits. But a Penn Wharton analysis found that the bill would probably increase inflation slightly for its first two years, before possibly reducing inflation later.

BIDEN'S RADICAL SEC AGENDA USES AGENCY TO MANDATE CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION

The tax on imported oil and petroleum products would seemingly break President Biden’s pledge that tax hikes will affect only those Americans earning $400,000 or more per year. Manchin has said the Democratic package honors that pledge. Taxes on oil and petroleum products are usually passed on to consumers in the form of higher energy prices. Energy prices have already broken records during Biden's presidency, and inflation has hit its highest rate in decades.

Manchin told ""The Faulkner Focus"" on Tuesday that an Inflation Reduction Act tax analysis which suggested the bill would raise taxes on nearly all Americans had been ""written by my friends on the Republican"" committee and not done by the whole Joint Committee on Taxation.

FOX Business reached out to JCT Chief of Staff Thomas A. Barthold who said the tax analysis was prepared ""by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.""

""The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation is a nonpartisan staff serving both sides of the Hill and both sides of the aisle. There is not a Republican staff. There is not a Democratic staff,"" he said.

A spokesperson for Manchin told FOX Business that Republicans on the Committee ""released a partial analysis of one portion of the bill to advance a partisan agenda that does not accurately reflect the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act on average Americans.""

SOARING INFLATION DRIVES MORE AMERICANS TO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK DESPITE 5.1% INCREASE IN WAGES

Manchin is one of Congress' most conservative and contrarian Democrats. He has spent over a year forcing his party to trim its economic proposals, citing inflation fears starkly, and his compromise with Schumer last week shocked colleagues who'd given up hope that he would agree to such a wide-ranging measure.

Manchin has asserted the bill's imposition of a 15% minimum tax on corporations earning over $1 billion annually is not a tax increase. He says it closes loopholes such companies use to escape paying the current 21% corporate tax.

Republicans mocked that reasoning and said its tax boosts would weaken the economy and kill jobs. They cited a report from Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that said about half of the corporate minimum tax would hit manufacturing firms.

""So in the middle of a supply chain crisis, Democrats want huge job-killing tax hikes that will disproportionately crush American manufacturing and manufacturing jobs,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Schumer said he expected votes to begin this week in the Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris could cast the tie-breaking vote to assure its passage. The narrowly divided House has left town for an August recess, but Democratic leaders have said they would bring lawmakers back for a vote, perhaps next week.

Such financial mechanisms, called third-party guarantors, are increasingly common in the auction industry and in several cases helped larger rival Sotheby’s $409 million modern-art sale the night before. Sotheby’s sale amounted to the house’s third-largest single sale total ever. But its success hinged in part on selling several pieces by Pablo Picasso and others to guarantors who only had to place single bids to win.

Market watchers pay attention to the number of bidders who compete for works at the priciest levels because thin bidding can hint at potential cracks in collector confidence. On Wednesday, two bidders vied for the Basquiat—so that could indicate collectors still crave his work at a broad level. The work’s wall-spanning size may also have played a role in its appeal.

MARILYN MONROE'S DRESSES FROM POPULAR MOVIES UP FOR AUCTION

Increasingly, millennial collectors are starting to champion a fresh slate of artists born long after Basquiat died in 1988. These include Anna Weyant, whose 2021 ""Buffet II"" sold to a telephone bidder in Hong Kong for $730,800 over its $150,000 high estimate. Another auction newcomer this season, María Berrío’s 2013 ""Burrow of the Yellow,"" also sold for $998,000 over its estimate of $400,000 to $600,000.

U.S. employers unexpectedly added 528,000 jobs in July, the Labor Department said Friday, a surprisingly strong gain that defied fears of a slowdown in labor markets as they confront scorching-hot inflation and rising interest rates. Wage growth also accelerated, surging by 0.5% in the one-month period from June.

CELEB CHEF GUY FIERI TAKES HIS CHICKEN JOINTS TO COUNTRY MUSIC’S CAPITAL

How much money does Guy Fieri make from television?

Last year, the chef reportedly signed an $80 million contract with the Food Network to host his two shows over the course of a three-year period. The new deal is a $30 million raise from Fieri's prior deal of $50 million, according to Forbes.

Fieri rakes in approximately $26 million per year, which is more than his competitor celebrity chefs such as Emeril Lagasse, who was paid $8 million, and Gordon Ramsay, who earned around $20 million last year. His signature show, ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dive"" first aired in 2006 and, after 33 seasons, earned more than $230 million in advertising revenue in 2020.

""I got a chance of a lifetime,"" Fieri told the Hollywood Reporter in the wake of the deal. ""I think I played it good.""

How did Guy Fieri rise to fame?

The $80 million deal represents a new level of success for Fieri who for most of his career was looked down upon by other celebrity chefs for his humble origins and simple tastes. Fieri started in the food industry at 10 years old and sold pretzels out of a stand. In France, he studied cooking and later moved to Las Vegas to attend the University of Nevada for hospitality management.

In 2006, Fieri was able to host his own show on the Food Network after winning in the second season of ""Next Food Network Star."" The show, ""Guy's Big Bite, only lasted for six episodes and Fieri earned approximately $1,000 per episode.

By 2019, Fieri, along with the late Julia Child, became the fourth celebrity chef to be awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has been featured in more than 14 series on the Food Network.

How many restaurants does Guy Fieri own?

Fieri, via his company Knuckle Sandwich LLC, recently launched Flavortown Kitchens, a virtual brand with more than 175 locations worldwide, according to the chef's website.

The segment really got started after World War 2 when the Willys ""Jeep"" became a civilian and gave Americans an affordable new way to enjoy the great outdoors.

It was followed by more vehicles from the Jeep brand and the likes of International Harvester Scout and Ford Bronco in the 1960s, the latter of which was first to adopt the ""Sports-Utility Vehicle"" description in its marketing.

More refined models were added to the mix with and started getting used as family cars, then AMC changed the game by turning the Concord car into the four-wheel-drive Eagle in 1981.

MORE AUTO NEWS FROM FOXBUSINESS.COM

The Toyota Rav4 kicked the crossover craze into gear in the 1990s while the cool factor of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ford Explorer lured people away from sedans, station wagons and minivans by the hundreds of thousands, even if the dirt parking lot at the soccer field was as far as they would ever go off the pavement.

Today, SUVs of all sorts account for over half of the vehicles sold in the U.S., which means they are officially mainstream, so automakers have found a new way to make them fashionable again: By going back to the future.

Aping the continued success of brands like Jeep, Subaru and Land Rover, many companies are turning their street-smart utility vehicles back into off-roaders with new trims that improve their rough road capability, or at least make it look like they do. There is even a minivan along for the ride and the new trend is arriving just as more Americans are getting involved in outdoor activities, driven in part by the coronavirus pandemic.

Here are a few of the latest SUVs aimed at the ""active lifestyle"" customers automakers are looking to appeal to today:

CHEVROLET TRAILBLAZER ACTIV: $27,020

The subcompact Trailblazer Activ is available in front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive and gets tougher styling than the other trims, plus improved ground clearance and designed for more rugged terrain than the rest of the lineup can handle.

Signature dark green upholstery adds a woodsy feel to the Expedition that best lives up to the model's name.

HONDA PASSPORT TRAILSPORT: $44,265

Honda's new TrailSport trim launched on the Passport midsize crossover SUV, but will spread to other Honda SUVs. For now, it's a mostly cosmetic upgrade that includes more aggressive front and rear styling and a slightly wider track for its all-season-tires, but Honda says that later versions will get functional modifications, as well.

The SUV may have stolen the minivan's mojo, but the ultimate people carrier is back with a vengeance. The Sienna Woodland comes with a standard hybrid all-wheel-drive system good for 35 mpg and gets the requisite increased ground clearance -- from 6.3 inches to a whopping 6.9 inches -- and redesigned front and rear fascias expected of one of these packages, plus a standard tow hitch and roof racks to help bring along enough gear for the seven passengers inside.

It was a telling indication of how involved and accessible the casino's next president plans to be.

Hired in June as Hard Rock's general manager, Faranca is being boosted to the top job now that current president Joe Lupo is heading to Las Vegas to run the Mirage casino once the company completes its purchase.

INFLATION CAUSE FOR 'CONCERN' AS TRAVEL-RELATED COSTS SOAR: HARD ROCK INTERNATIONAL CHAIRMAN

He's being handed the city's No. 2 casino in terms of money won from in-person gamblers (No. 3 when internet and sports betting money are included); a resort that has upped the city's game in terms of live entertainment.

But Faranca's gaze extends beyond the casino's walls to the city around it: He's been meeting with city officials on safety and cleanliness initiatives, pledges to continue Hard Rock's history of supporting charitable and community groups, and realizes the casino's success or failure rests squarely on the shoulders of its employees.

That's why late on a busy Saturday night, with a million other things to keep track of, he was huddling with the cleaning staff.

""I make it a point to go to pre-shift meetings with all the different departments, to thank them for what they do and connect with them,"" Faranca said.

A Philadelphia native, Faranca began his casino career in Atlantic City as a guest services manager at Harrah's and the Showboat. He worked in general manager roles at Philadelphia's Parx casino, the Palms in Las Vegas and at Maryland Live!, where he also was executive vice president, before joining Hard Rock.

Faranca says he has five core principles he plans to follow in his new job: Be the employer of choice in your market. Deliver exceptional hospitality. Clearly understand your property's strategy. Focus on the community. Have a commitment from ownership.

The casino is considering doing some hotel room and suite upgrades, and plans to diversify its entertainment lineup even more, he said.

Jim Allen, the global chairman of Hard Rock, has long pushed Atlantic City officials to make the city safer and cleaner, and has not hesitated to call them out when he feels conditions are poor. Faranca has already picked up that baton.

HARD ROCK INTERNATIONAL CHAIRMAN WARNS ECONOMIC CHALLENGES 'IN FRONT OF US ARE REAL'

""I hope everyone rallies behind the idea of a safe and clean Atlantic City,"" he said. ""When guests visit the city, they need a safe visit.""

He has already had discussions with City Councilman Kaleem Shabazz about the need for safety and cleanliness in the city, and will serve on the board of the Atlantic City Police Department Foundation.

""He is very sincere and open to working with government,"" Shabazz said. ""He seems to have a good sense of how a partnership should go and what issues in the community should be dealt with. I feel a strong sense of his community engagement.""

Lupo, the outgoing Hard Rock president, called Faranca ""a great guy, smart, with great experience. I could not be more pleased.""

His advice for his successor?

""Strong leadership is critical,"" Lupo said. ""Follow the direction of CEO Jim Allen, work compassionately and collaboratively with our wonderful Hard Rock team and the Atlantic City community, and even greater success will follow.""

With Hard Rock surging in the market, the question has been raised: Can it surpass the Borgata to become Atlantic City's top-performing casino?

Faranca smiles and refers to his five business principles.

Wagner, a Hall of Fame shortstop who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates in the early 1900s, was said to be upset that his likeness was being used on a tobacco product. He refused American Tobacco Co.’s request to use his image, which led to the company ceasing production of his card.
