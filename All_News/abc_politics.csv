Turner spoke to ABC News’ “GMA3” about engaging his community to join the fight against gun violence and how his city’s gun buyback program was able to voluntarily collect more than 845 guns in just one day.

GMA3: What can you point to in the [gun buyback program] that works to actually, not just collect some guns, but to actually bring down the gun violence problem?

TURNER: Look, it's not just one initiative. We put forth, in February of this year, an initiative called One Safe Houston. And it's a part of supporting our police department, adding 125 police officers more a day through our overtime initiative.

So it's adding more police, it's providing more technology, it's dealing with crisis prevention, intervention and diversion. It's our reentry program for people coming out of our criminal justice system, and then it's about a community initiative.

The gun buyback program is one of several. There's $1 million that I've allocated out of $53 million to the One Safe Houston initiative. So you have to look at it collectively. In terms of the response that we had a few weeks ago.

I would tell you it was overwhelming. It was supposed to have been from 8 to 12. We end up having to cut it off at about 7 p.m., more than 845 guns were turned in and we gave priority vouchers to 150 other cars that we had to turn away because we couldn't get to it.

So I think that if we took one gun off the street that could have been used in seriously injuring or killing someone, then the program, the initiative was worth it.

GMA3: And Mayor, I want to ask specifically about if you have any sort of way to gauge the effectiveness. I know you just launched this earlier in the year, but have you seen a change in the crime rate? What do you want to see?

TURNER: Well, let me just tell you, we had people who came, mothers, for example, who came and said, “Look, I have too many guns in this house and I don't want them stolen and then used by someone else or I don't want any of my children or their friends to come and act and get a hold of these guns and then seriously injuring themselves.”

We had people who came and turned in automatics, who said, “Look, because of inflation and everything else, I need the money more so than this gun right now.” Two or three months down the road, he said it might be different. [But] those guns were removed.

In the state of Texas what we know, there are way, way too many guns and people can access these guns better than they can access going to vote.

And so [we are doing] anything that we can do to draw attention to the fact that there are way too many guns and guns are the leading cause of death of our children in this country.

And if we can remove 845-plus guns, as we did two weekends ago on that Saturday morning, then this program is worth it.

And I will tell you, it was one way that the community could participate and in doing something to address public safety. And we plan on doing at least two others in this city over the next 2 to 3 months.

Mayor Sylvester Turner is interviewed in Houston, June 21, 2022. Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILE

GMA3: Is this a matter of community engagement [and] that the citizens can actually feel like they are contributing in some way to a problem in Houston and other major cities?

TURNER: It's about all of that and more. It's important for people to recognize that creating a safe city is not just about police. Law enforcement cannot do it alone. And even though we are provided $10.7 million in overtime for additional police, they can't do it alone. It's not just about the technology.

The community has to be an active participant in terms of creating a very safe city and people are willing to participate and you have to give them an opportunity to participate.

And then bear in mind, in the state of Texas, the legislature last year implemented what we call House Bill 1927, where people can carry guns. There is no permit license permitted, I mean, required, no training. And so it has created this environment that really glorifies guns and people want to fill it. They want to be a part of the solution.

And so the gun buyback program… was a voluntary relinquishment initiative. And let me underscore this. This is where the people themselves voluntarily brought their guns to us. And they were working in collaboration with the police, with our faith-based community, with our community activists and leaders and then the people themselves.

So it was a very collaborative initiative and we didn't know what to expect. But what I can tell you, the line was 2 miles long all day.

GMA3: Houston's recorded the hottest July on record there. How are you holding up? How is the city's power grid? What more needs to be done to make sure that the people in your community can stay cool and stay safe?

TURNER: Well, I would tell you that the Texas power grid, it's still unreliable. This has been a very, very hot summer.

But as chair of Climate and U.S. Climate Mayors, I would tell you climate change is real. The bill that was just passed by the Senate, the Inflation Reduction Act, will go a long way. That's historic funding for climate initiative. And so these storms are coming with greater frequency and greater intensity.

In the last seven years, the city of Houston has faced seven federally declared disasters. So the storms are coming with greater frequency. We are addressing that. We're learning to adapt. We're putting in place climate mitigation initiatives. We're planting 4.6 million trees this decade, using cooling pavement, a lot of redundancy in generators to really make sure that, especially communities that are underserved and under-resourced, that they are not left out and left behind."

Once the committee receives the requested returns, they are reviewed in private but could be made public by a majority vote of committee members.
Despite a possible further appeal from Trump, Neal touted the latest ruling as a win.
When we receive the returns, we will begin our oversight of the IRS's mandatory presidential audit program,"" Neal said in a statement.","The House Ways and Means Committee first sought the records in 2019.

A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the House Ways and Means Committee can obtain Donald Trump's tax returns in the latest blow to the former president's effort to shield his finances from Democratic lawmakers.

In the opinion for the three-judge panel, Circuit Judge David Sentelle, a Ronald Reagan appointee, wrote that the committee's investigation served a valid legislative purpose and that the 2019 request for Trump's records was not a retaliatory move in violation of his First Amendment rights.

""The need for the Trump Parties' information to inform potential legislation overrides the burden to the Executive Branch largely because that burden is so tenuous,"" Sentelle wrote.

While the committee said it expects to receive the returns ""immediately,"" it's not clear how quickly that process will unfold -- given that Trump could still appeal the ruling.

A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.

Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal, D-Mass., first took action three years ago under a 97-year-old law that requires, by request, the treasury secretary to ""furnish"" the returns of any taxpayer to the chairman of the tax-writing panel.

Democrats successfully argued before the court that the returns were necessary for the tax-writing panel to obtain for a review of the IRS presidential audit program and to determine whether any reforms are needed.

Trump has sought to keep his tax returns under wraps ever since he launched his presidential bid in 2015, claiming that he was not at liberty to release the documents because of an audit. That position was cited by the House panel in launching its probe.

""[T]he Chairman made clear in his letter that the tax returns and return information of the Trump Parties are unique among former Presidents … and learning about how the audit of these complex returns proceeded is necessary to learn whether the Audit Program is sufficiently staffed and resourced to handle such complex information,"" Sentelle wrote in Tuesday's opinion.

Once the committee receives the requested returns, they are reviewed in private but could be made public by a majority vote of committee members.

Despite a possible further appeal from Trump, Neal touted the latest ruling as a win.

""With great patience, we followed the judicial process, and yet again, our position has been affirmed by the Courts. I'm pleased that this long-anticipated opinion makes clear the law is on our side. When we receive the returns, we will begin our oversight of the IRS's mandatory presidential audit program,"" Neal said in a statement.

Trump's refusal to release his tax returns has led to years of heightened speculation about his sprawling -- and murky -- finances, and reports have surfaced about the extent of his past business practices and personal wealth.

The appellate court's ruling comes a day after the FBI searched Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. That search was carried out in connection to Trump's transport of classified documents to his home after leaving the White House last year, sources told ABC. Trump labeled the raid political persecution.

The former president is also under legal scrutiny in Georgia -- over his efforts to have his 2020 loss in the state overturned -- and in New York over allegations he inflated the value of his business. He has denied all wrongdoing."

The House Jan. 6 committee was expected Tuesday to interview Donald Trump's former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Pennsylvania GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.

ABC News first reported in July that Pompeo was in negotiations to sit with committee investigators behind closed doors. (CNN and The New York Times, respectively, first reported Mastriano and Pompeo's appearances before the panel.)

Mastriano has not agreed to the terms of his own closed-door interview with investigators. Mastriano's attorney wants to record the deposition or have access to the committee's recording after the fact. The committee has not agreed to that.

That has raised the possibility that in his virtual appearance, Mastriano may not answer questions or refuse to proceed. Mastriano has said he would walk out of a deposition with investigators if they didn't agree to his terms.

Mastriano, who has baselessly challenged the results of the 2020 election, was outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but he has said he left when rioting broke out -- calling the violence ""unacceptable.""

His attorney previously told the Associated Press that he spoke with the FBI and ""told them the truth about everything that happened that day.""

The previous outreach to Pompeo, meanwhile, was an indication of the committee's continuing interest in gathering information and testimony from high-level Trump administration officials as the panel moved closer toward the release in the fall of a public report on its findings.

More hearings are expected related to the committee's report.

""We have a number of many interviews scheduled that are coming up. We anticipate talking to additional members of the president's Cabinet.

The law -- known as the CHIPS and Science Act -- spends nearly $53 billion to spur research in and development of America's semiconductor industry. It is intended to address a nearly two-year global chip shortage that stemmed from supply chain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Semiconductors are common in everyday items from cell phones to cars to microwaves and more; experts compare them to the ""brain"" for any machine with a computer system.

Tuesday's event coincided with GlobalFoundries, Micron and Qualcomm announcing partnerships and investments that total nearly $45 billion.

Micron's $40-billion investment ""will bring the U.S. market share of memory chip production from less than 2 percent to up to 10 percent over the next decade,"" the White House said in a statement.

The bill enacted Tuesday also has a national defense angle, its supporter say, as Congress and the White House look to bolster chip production domestically.

According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, a lobbying group focused on semiconductor manufacturing, the U.S. produces 12% of the world's chips, down from 37% in 1990.

At the signing event, Biden was joined by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.

""In the last six weeks alone, we passed not only CHIPS and Science, but also veterans' health care, gun safety, NATO and now the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has passed the Senate,"" Schumer said, referring to the recent reconciliation spending bill that Democrats narrowly approved last weekend.

That package had temporarily created turmoil for CHIPS in Congress.

Following a surprise agreement between Schumer and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia that revived the IRA, some Republicans said they felt slighted by the Democratic progress on a party-line reconciliation package mere hours after CHIPS passed the upper chamber with a bipartisan majority.

Despite that consternation, Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Todd Young of Indiana attended Tuesday's bill signing. Young led the GOP in negotiations on the bill, which ultimately passed the Senate 64-33 on July 27.

""I don't want to get you in trouble, but you did a hell of a job,"" Biden said to the two Republicans.

The president, at times, spoke through a thick, wet cough during the ceremony. The White House has said he repeatedly tested negative for COVID over the weekend, and he subsequently left isolation after a rebound case of the infection.

Biden did not mention the FBI's Monday search of former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, which Trump decried as political persecution. (Sources told ABC News the operation was related to the 15 boxes of documents that Trump took when he departed the White House, some of which the National Archives has said were marked classified.)

In Wisconsin, several Republicans are hoping to take on incumbent Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in a race with implications for abortion rights and the 2024 election in a politically divided state.

Trump has thrown his support behind Tim Michels, a veteran and co-owner of a construction company. Michels has been pitching himself as a political outsider, even though this is not his first run for public office.

Michels has avoided saying whether or not he would try to attempt the impossible and reverse Trump's defeat in the 2020 election, something that other Trump endorsees have said that they plan to do.

Former President Donald Trump takes the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas, Aug. 6, 2022. Brian Snyder/Reuters

Michels' opponent Rebecca Kleefisch, a former two-term lieutenant governor, is backed by Pence and former Gov. Scott Walker. Kleefisch initially said President Joe Biden was legitimately elected, but she has since baselessly claimed the election was ""rigged"" -- comparing it even to the NFL ""Deflategate"" scandal.

Both candidates have hardline stances on abortion access, with the two supporting the state's 1849 abortion ban, which criminalized abortion and banned doctors from performing the procedure unless it was to save the mother's life.

The state's Senate primary race is essentially over for both parties, with Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes clearing the once-crowded field of Democratic opponents to position himself as the presumptive nominee. He will most likely face-off against Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who faces no serious challenger in the primary.

Johnson is considered one of the most vulnerable GOP incumbents facing reelection this year. Democrats see his state as one of their best opportunities to flip a seat in Congress' upper chamber. Barnes is the state's first Black lieutenant governor and if he wins in November, he would be the first Black U.S. senator from Wisconsin.

Wisconsin's primaries will feature another Trump-Pence split, this time in the 63 State Assembly District race where Trump-backed Adam Steen faces off against Assembly Speaker Robin Vos -- who earned Trump's disfavor because he couldn't overturn the 2020 election results in the state, though not because he didn't try.

In Minnesota, Democratic incumbent Rep. Ilhan Omar faces a formidable primary challenger in her third bid for her Congressional seat. The race is the latest example this cycle of a progressive incumbent against a moderate challenger. She and her main opponent, Don Samuels, who is endorsed by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have quarreled over hot-button issues such as police reform and Biden's infrastructure plans.

In Vermont, for the first time in history, state voters are almost certain to send a woman to Congress -- making it the last in the nation to break the streak. In the primary race to fill the sole House seat of outgoing Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, the top two candidates are Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and state Sen. Becca Balint.

""The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,"" McCarthy continued. ""When Republicans take back the House, we will conduct immediate oversight of this department, follow the facts, and leave no stone unturned.""

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., took it a step further, tweeting: ""DEFUND THE FBI!""

A Twitter account for Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee run by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, tweeted: ""This is what happens in third world countries. Not the United States."" Another tweet read: ""If they can do it to a former President, imagine what they can do to you.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a series of tweets that ""launching such an investigation of a former President this close to an election is beyond problematic.""

""We're 100 days away from midterm elections. President Trump is likely going to run again in 2024,"" Graham tweeted. ""No one is above the law. The law must be above politics.

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, called the Mar-a-Lago search ""incredibly concerning.""

""We need answers NOW,"" Scott tweeted. ""The FBI must explain what they were doing today & why.""

Several Republican senators used the operation to further criticize President Joe Biden's sweeping climate, health care and tax bill, which Senate Democrats passed on Sunday and which includes nearly $80 billion in funding for the Internal Revenue Service. For instance, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted: ""After todays raid on Mar A Lago what do you think the left plans to use those 87,000 new IRS agents for?""

Other Republicans, including potential 2024 presidential candidates, continued to attack the Justice Department and the FBI.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis tweeted that the raid ""is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies,"" then said: ""Banana Republic.""

Former Secretary of State and ex-CIA Director Mike Pompeo said executing a search warrant against a former president ""is dangerous.""

""The apparent political weaponization of DOJ/FBI is shameful,"" Pompeo tweeted. ""I served on Benghazi Com where we proved Hilliary [sic] possessed classified info. We didn't raid her home.""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., called the raid ""unprecedented.""

Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also released a statement asserting -- without evidence -- that the search was an attempt by Democrats to ""weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans.""

""Countless times we have examples of Democrats flouting the law and abusing power with no recourse. Democrats continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans,"" McDaniel said. ""This raid is outrageous. This abuse of power must stop and the only way to do that is to elect Republicans in November.""

Midterm candidates also pounced on the news, calling for retaliation against the Justice Department, indicating a new wave of GOP lawmakers next year may be unforgiving over the raid.

""It's time for us in the Florida Legislature to call an emergency legislative session & amend our laws regarding federal agencies. Sever all ties with DOJ immediately. Any FBI agent conducting law enforcement functions outside the purview of our State should be arrested upon sight,"" tweeted Florida state Rep. Andrew Sabatini, who is running for the U.S. House.

""This is one of the darkest days in American history: the day our Government, originally created by the People, turned against us. This illegitimate, corrupt Regime hates America and has weaponized the entirety of the Federal Government to take down President Donald Trump,"" said Kari Lake, the Trump-backed Arizona Republican gubernatorial nominee. ""As Governor, I will fight these Tyrants with every fiber of my being. America -- dark days lie ahead for us. May God protest us and save our Country.""

The backlash marks a departure from Republicans' criticism of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race while she was under FBI investigation into her handling of classified information.

That investigation centered around Clinton's use of a personal email server for some communications during her time as secretary of state. Her personal server was ultimately found to contain more than 100 emails containing classified information. Clinton insisted that the use of the personal server was an honest mistake, and she was never charged with any criminal wrongdoing, though the cloud of the public investigation was thought by some Democrats at the time as contributing to her loss to Trump.

""Every investigation thus far makes one conclusion abundantly clear: Secretary Clinton's fundamental lack of judgment and wanton disregard for protecting and keeping information confidential raises continued questions about the exposure of our nation's diplomatic and national security secrets,"" McCarthy said in a statement then.

""The FBI's initial investigation made it clear that Secretary Clinton's unlawful and extremely reckless handling of classified information continues to put America's national security at risk. We are a nation of laws, and those laws should be applied equally to all Americans, regardless of their political connections,"" Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., now the House minority whip, said in his own statement at the time.

Multiple sources confirmed to ABC News that Trump's residence in Palm Beach, Florida, was searched by FBI agents on Monday, starting around 10 a.m. local time. The former president was not there.

Sources said the operation was related to the 15 boxes of documents that Trump took when he departed the White House, some of which the National Archives has said were marked classified.

Later Monday, during a planned tele-rally with Sarah Palin ahead of her upcoming special election in Alaska, Trump didn't specifically mention the raid but appeared to briefly reference it when saying: ""Another day in paradise. This is a strange day.""

Law enforcement sources told ABC News that the FBI's activities at Trump's compound are court-authorized.

The Justice Department and FBI declined to comment.

A senior official briefed on Monday's events told ABC News that the Secret Service was notified by the FBI a short time before agents arrived that they would be coming. The Secret Service validated the search warrant and facilitated entry into the residence, in accordance with a court order, the official said. Secret Service agents were not involved in the search.

The Secret Service declined to comment.

A Biden administration official told ABC News that the White House received no advanced notice of the raid.

ABC News contributor and former federal prosecutor Kan Nawaday said the raid is ""extraordinary"" but not ""that surprising.""

""I don't think we've ever seen this,"" Nawaday told ABC News Live Prime on Monday night. ""At the same time, to me, it doesn't seem that surprising, given all the evidence that the Jan. 6 committee has set forth about possible crimes relating to [the Capitol riot].""

""I think the indication is that it's moving forward. They are taking active action and following the leads and following the evidence,"" he added. ""It's only a matter of time, in my view, that they're going to work up the chain to other potential targets.""

The Senate on Sunday narrowly approved a $700 billion-plus tax, climate and health care-pricing bill, capping an unusually jam-packed summer on Capitol Hill and marking another win for Democrats' fragile congressional majorities before they face a competitive midterm cycle with the GOP eager to retake control.

Over the past 12 weeks, Democrats (joined with some Republicans) have pieced together passage on a slate of legislation for veterans' health care, the tech manufacturing industry, gun violence prevention and, finally, a social spending bill they have been working on in some form since President Joe Biden took office last year.

The Senate also approved Finland and Sweden joining NATO.

The flurry of activity is tempered by a looming political reality: Despite Democratic achievements, multiple of which were passed with bipartisan majorities, Biden's approval ratings remain underwater on a number of issues that voters say are top of mind, including the economy and historically high inflation.

As Democrats prepare to face voters in November, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer insisted that Americans will soon begin to see the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act -- the tax, health and climate bill passed Sunday -- and other legislation, priorities that have proven popular in recent polling.

Having left COVID-19 isolation over the weekend, Biden will sign the PACT and CHIPS acts -- for veterans and computer chip manufacturing, respectively -- on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to the White House. The House will take up the IRA on Friday before sending it to Biden's desk for his signature.

Here's an overview of the notable measures Congress has passed this summer.

The IRA

Democrats' latest reconciliation spending bill raises taxes on large corporations and the wealthy, allows Medicare to negotiate down some prescription drug costs, extends Affordable Care Act subsidies to make health insurance cheaper, makes major investments in combating climate change and opens millions of acres in federal property to oil and gas drilling, among other things, while cutting hundreds of millions from the federal deficit.

The IRA passed along party lines, 51-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. Its passage comes off the heels of turbulent negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. and then the addition of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.; both Manchin and Sinema are centrists in the Democratic caucus whose approval was key in the divided Senate.

The legislation's tax provisions, prescription drug-pricing reform, as well as boosted IRS tax enforcement measures, are anticipated to raise an estimated revenue of $739 billion -- $300 billion of which Democrats say would go toward reducing the deficit.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the bill would have a minimal affect on high inflation in the short-term but would reduce federal budget deficits by $102 billion over 10 years.

""It's been a long tough and winding road, at last we've arrived,"" Schumer said on Sunday. ""Our bill reduces inflation, lowers costs, creates millions of manufacturing jobs, enhances our energy security and is the boldest climate action in US history.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who led Republicans in uniform opposition to the IRA, took another view: ""Democrats' policies have torn down the savings, the stability, and the lifestyles that families worked and sacrificed for years to build up. The effect of this one-party government has been an economic assault on the American middle class,"" he said in a statement.

PACT

PACT expedites care and disability payments to veterans related to illnesses caused by toxic exposure from so-called ""burn pits"" during their service.

The proposal initially passed the Senate earlier this year. But after a small fix in the House required the bill to be voted on again, 26 Republican senators then changed their votes and blocked swift passage last week, objecting to a so-called ""budget gimmick"" they argued could be exploited by Democrats.

Amid outcry from veterans' advocates, including comedian Jon Stewart, the Senate took up PACT again.

A final 86-11 vote on the passage of the bill came Tuesday, after long hours of emotional lobbying.

""Every so often folks, America lives up to its ideals, and those are days that we savor,"" Schumer said at a press conference outside the Senate after the vote.

CHIPS

A bipartisan group in the House passed a bill in late July that boosts the domestic production of crucial semiconductor -- computer -- chips, along with funding the nation's science and technology industries with additional research and development.

CHIPS cleared the chamber in a 243-187 vote (with one ""present"" vote) despite late-hour pushes from GOP leadership against the legislation Twenty-four Republicans joined Democrats in backing the measure out of what would have been additional GOP support, curbed because of the surprise development that Schumer and Manchin had brokered a deal on the IRA, despite many conservatives believing Manchin had killed hopes of a party-line reconciliation bill.

Supporters of the $280 billion proposal highlight the roughly $52 billion it provides to incentivize the creation of semiconductor facilities, increasing American competitiveness in an industry where countries like China dominate.

There's a nationwide shortage of the needed computer chips, which has caused production delays, stalling industries from automotive to medical and spurring already-punishing inflation rates.

Gun control

In late June, Biden signed the first major piece of federal gun legislation in almost 30 years, after Congress swiftly passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.

The Senate approved the anti-gun violence package by a vote of 65-33, including the entire Democratic caucus and 15 Republicans like Minority Leader McConnell.

A group of senators began crafting the legislation in the aftermath of the May mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, that killed 19 children and two teachers.

But the law doesn't go as far as Democrats -- and Biden -- wanted, excluding measures such as universal background checks and a reinstating a federal ban on assault-style weapons (as well as banning high-capacity magazines). But it does support the implementation of so-called ""red flag"" laws to remove firearms from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others, as well as other violence prevention programs.

It also provides funding for a variety of programs aimed at shoring up the nation's mental health apparatus and securing schools.

""At a time when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential,"" Biden has said.

Tuesday's GOP race for governor of Wisconsin may look like another in a string of MAGA-vs.-establishment proxy fights.

Except this one is being fought on terms virtually dictated by former President Donald Trump -- and falls at a moment Republicans are rallying to his defense, even as the FBI turns up the heat.

The leading GOP candidates in the major races Tuesday all traffic in baseless claims that the 2020 election was either rigged or may have been outright stolen from Trump. Their main point of disagreement has been whether to still try to overturn the results in Wisconsin, nearly two years after President Joe Biden's victory was certified.

Trump's candidate, Tim Michels, is actually less aggressive on that topic than another contender who is endorsed by Trump loyalists Michael Flynn and Mike Lindell. Even former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch -- the candidate backed by former Vice President Mike Pence and former Gov. Scott Walker -- is in the ""rigged"" camp, having compared the election to the NFL ""Deflategate"" scandal after initially acknowledging Biden's victory as legitimate.

It's looking like a MAGA takeover inside the state that will host the 2024 Republican National Convention. Wisconsin GOP voters are also set to re-nominate Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., on Tuesday, after Johnson emerged as one of the biggest Trump defenders and boosters in Congress.

Voting in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Connecticut and Vermont on Tuesday will add substantially to the more than 200 Republican nominees who either deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election or continue to raise questions about it, according to data compiled by FiveThirtyEight and ABC News.

Trump's false claims have spread so widely inside the GOP that it's not even clear there are primary candidates who would benefit from a backlash against him, even if that existed as an electoral force. Efforts to rebut or even channel some of his most outrageous claims have almost entirely fallen flat.

The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper

In two states holding primaries Tuesday, decisions at the ballot box could pave the way for historic elections in November.

In Wisconsin, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes is the presumptive Democratic nominee after three major candidates in the once-crowded field coalesced behind him. If he wins in November, he could be the first Black senator from the state of Wisconsin.

""I know what a lack of opportunity means and I carry my story of my experiences as a Black man who was born in Milwaukee who still lives in Milwaukee,"" Barnes said in an interview with ABC News. ""I take that all across Wisconsin.""

He'll have to beat incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in a race Wisconsin political experts say will be intense.

""Mandela Barnes is going to face millions and millions of dollars of negative ads, and he is untested in terms of how he will hold up under that kind of barrage of negative campaigning,"" University of Wisconsin-La Crosse professor Anthony Chergosky said.

Voters in Vermont could, for the first time, send a woman to Congress. There, Democrat Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and state Sen. Becca Balint are considered top candidates for the at-large seat currently held by Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt. He is vacating the seat to run for Senate. Gray has the backing of retiring Sen. Patrick Leahy and former Vermont Gov. and DNC chair Howard Dean. Balint is the pick of progressive standard-bearers like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

Vermont is the only state in the country that hasn't sent a woman to Capitol Hill as a member of Congress.

The TIP with Alisa Wiersema

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appears to be leaning into his growing conservative notoriety by planning to hit the campaign trail in the coming weeks for a series of ""Unite and Win"" rallies hosted by the conservative group, Turning Point Action.

The schedule, which was announced Monday, includes stops in the midterm battlegrounds of Arizona, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where DeSantis will publicly back Republican nominees for statewide offices including Arizona gubernatorial and Senate nominees Kari Lake and Blake Masters, Ohio nominee for U.S. Senate J.D. Vance and Pennsylvania's gubernatorial nominee, Doug Mastriano.

All of the candidates made 2020 election denial a cornerstone of their platforms while earning former President Donald Trump's endorsement ahead of their primaries.

""Gov. DeSantis is America's governor and one of the most popular leaders in America. He has become the model for a new conservative movement that is willing to stand on principle and to actually fight on behalf of the values of his voters,"" Charlie Kirk, founder and president of Turning Point Action, said in a statement.

DeSantis' moves to campaign outside of Florida while in the middle of his own reelection campaign could signal higher political aspirations for 2024. Although the rallies are being billed as opportunities to unite Republicans after a divisive primary season, it remains to be seen whether Trump -- who continues to hint at a second presidential run -- will welcome another conservative force into the spotlight.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is seeking an outside prosecutor to consider charges against a group of prominent individuals for having allegedly engaged in a ""conspiracy"" to unlawfully gain access to voting machines used in the 2020 presidential election.

Among the accused is Nessel's presumptive Republican challenger, Matt DePerno, whom Nessel claims was ""one of the prime instigators"" but who adamantly denies wrongdoing.

In February, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson requested the attorney general's office and the state police investigate reports of an ""unnamed third party"" gaining access to tabulation machines and data drives.

The nine people now under scrutiny include likely Republican attorney general candidate DePerno; Republican state Rep. Daire Rendon of Lake City; and Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf, who had filed -- in a matter unrelated to the attorney general's current request -- multiple lawsuits against state agencies he claimed were investigating his allegations of voter fraud in the 2020 election.

Nessel's petition for a special prosecutor, filed Friday, alleges that the nine individuals, including DePerno, attempted to convince local clerks in the state to turn over five tabulators, which were then taken to hotels or rental residences where they were then broken into and had ""tests"" performed ""on the equipment.""

The petition further claims that DePerno was ""present at a hotel room during such 'testing.'""

In a statement Sunday night, DePerno's campaign said he ""categorically denies the allegations presented. The petition itself is entirely an incoherent liberal fever dream of lies. The claims presented by Nessel show a completely unwarranted and erroneous attack purely based on political prosecution.""

DePerno's campaign added that ""if Dana Nessel decides to move forward with these claims, she will ultimately find herself on the defendant's side of a malicious prosecution case.""

David Eggert/AP, FILE | Junfu Han/USA Today Network, FILE

According to Nessel's petition, State Rep. Rendon also allegedly told Roscommon County Clerk Michelle Stevenson that ""representatives were doing an investigation into election fraud and needed her voting machine.""

Stevenson eventually handed over a tabulator and several USB drives, the petition states. When asked by another person allegedly affiliated with Rendon to hand over a computer containing the county's election reporting management software, the clerk initially refused the request but later said that she would allow the individual to ""copy the software from the stand-alone county computer.""

As weeks passed and Stevenson grew ""more apprehensive"" about where her equipment was, Rendon told her ""not to worry about the tabulators, as she was doing the right thing and they had her back,"" the petition claims. Rendon allegedly said that Stevenson's name ""would never come up.""

Sharon Olson, the clerk for Irving Township, also said she was asked by Sheriff Dar Leaf ""to cooperate with investigators regarding an election fraud investigation,"" according to the petition. After that conversation, Olson turned over her tabulator to a third party.

In a tweet on Sunday, Secretary of State Benson wrote, ""There must be consequences for those who break the law to undermine our elections [and] further political goals.""

Benson continued, ""The election clerks of this state do their jobs with professionalism and integrity and will continue to ensure they are equipped with a full understanding of the legal protections in place to block bad actors from pressuring them to gain access to secure election systems.""

DePerno, who is backed by former President Donald Trump, is likely to face Nessel, a Democrat, in the November election.

Two House Democrats -- from New Jersey and Minnesota -- are appealing to members of their own party in Wyoming to ""consider"" changing their affiliations ahead of the state's contentious Republican primary on Aug. 16 in order to back incumbent Rep. Liz Cheney.

In separate advertisements from an organization called Wyomingites Defending Freedom And Democracy, Reps. Tom Malinowski and Dean Phillips asked Wyoming Democrats to ""consider temporarily switching parties"" in order to vote for Cheney, one of Donald Trump's most vocal critics, over Cheney's Trump-backed opponent.

""Liz Cheney and I don't agree on everything, but we're on the same side today, fighting for our country,"" Malinowski said in his ad.

""Wyoming Democrats can put country over party too, by registering to vote for her in the Republican primary,"" he said. ""I hope you do.""

In his ad, Phillips said: ""Principle must always come before politics. And nobody has shown more honor, integrity and courage than [Cheney]."" He also asked Wyoming Democrats to switch their political parties for Aug. 16.

Cheney, a three-term Republican congresswoman -- as well as the vice chair of the House Jan. 6 committee and former No. 3 House Republican -- faces a serious challenge to hold Wyoming's only congressional district against Harriet Hageman.

Cheney's intense criticism of Trump's election denial and behavior around Jan. 6 earned her the scorn of the GOP base as well as some Republican colleagues, who booted her from House leadership.

Wyomingites Defending Freedom And Democracy has spent $26,698 on ads over the last week, according to Facebook analytics, beginning to run the ones with Malinowski and Phillips over the weekend.

On their website, the group has links available for Wyoming Democrats to complete voter registration applications and change forms, along with information on how to submit that to relevant county clerk offices no later than 14 days before the primary election.

Wyoming voters can also change party affiliations at polling locations on the day of the primary or general election or when requesting an absentee ballot, the website notes. Wyoming law allows voters to switch their party affiliations back for future elections.

Malinowski, the Democratic incumbent of New Jersey's recently redrawn 7th Congressional District, is vulnerable himself to a GOP victory in the seat he flipped blue in 2018.

Moderate Democrat Phillips separately made news last week for saying that he would not support President Joe Biden in 2024 in hopes of a ""new generation"" of leadership.

The new campaign to get voters to switch parties may have begun to work -- at least for a few thousand registered Democrats over the past month, according to the state.

In July, 43,285 Democrats were registered to vote in Wyoming, with 200,579 registered Republicans and 34,925 unaffiliated. In August, 39,753 Democrats were registered in the state, with 207,674 registered Republicans and 33,769 unaffiliated, Wyoming elections data shows.

Still, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis earlier this year, Cheney has only a small chance of switching enough Democrats to make up for any Republican deficit -- simply given how many Republicans are in the state.

Cheney and her defenders have been actively campaigning on a ""pro-democracy"" message, attempting to pit her and her anti-Trump minority faction of the Republican party against the former president.

Cheney released a new ad herselfon Thursday in which her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, came out in support of his daughter's reelection campaign.

""In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our Republic than Donald Trump,"" Vice President Cheney said. ""He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him."""

After he got the green light to leave isolation, Biden traveled to his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, before traveling Monday to Kentucky.","At least 37 people were killed in the heavy rains.

President Joe Biden on Monday traveled to Kentucky to survey damage from severe flooding in the state -- a visit that also marks his first official trip since he tested positive for COVID-19 last month.

He landed in Lexington on Monday morning to talk with local officials about the flooding, which killed at least 37 people after rain soaked the eastern part of the state. On Sunday, the president amended an existing emergency declaration for Kentucky to free up additional disaster assistance.

Biden and first lady Jill Biden met with Gov. Andy Beshear and Kentucky first lady Britainy Beshear. The Bidens also visited families affected by the flooding and made an unannounced stop at Lost Creek, site of some of the damage.

In Lost Creek, the president reaffirmed his promise of federal assistance “until everybody is back where they were.”

Biden said he had just met one man across the road from where he was speaking who told him that he didn’t “want to ask too much” of the federal government because people there are used to “having neighbors help us out.”

“I said, ‘You're kidding me.’ Seriously. And he pointed out that -- here's the deal, it is true that the people here in this community, in Western Kentucky and the folks I've met [after last year's] tornado, they’re not just Kentuckians, they're Americans. They're Americans. This happened in America! American problem! And we're all Americans, everybody has an obligation to help,"" Biden said. ""We have the capacity to do this. It's not like it's beyond our control. The weather may be beyond our control for now, but it's not beyond our control.""

Biden also promised local families that he was “coming back” because he wanted to see the area once it was rebuilt.

""It's going to take a while to get through this. But I promise you, we are not leaving. The federal government and all the resources, we're not leaving. As long as it takes, we're going to be here,"" the president said at a separate roundtable event on the flooding on Monday.

""We want to help everybody, every American the same way,"" he added. ""But some outfits who are asking for help -- some Democrat, Republican, doesn't matter -- some folks don't know what to do with it as quickly as they think they can use it.""

Beshear, alongside Biden, praised the assistance that has already come into the state from charities but said federal aid would go a long way in the flood recovery.

""We are overwhelmed with clothes and water and the rest. There are a lot of good charities out there, including our team in Eastern Kentucky Tornado Relief Fund, the Red Cross and others but [what] we need now are the dollars and the medium-term and long-term rebuilding,"" the governor said.

Leaving Kentucky on Monday, Biden once again spoke of bipartisan success just before taking off from Lexington.

""Think it was a good day, we're going to get a lot done down in Kentucky,"" he said.

One reporter asked why his message of bipartisan success hasn't been resonating, given his ""terrible"" polling numbers.

Biden previously visited Kentucky in December to survey tornado damage in the state.

He told reporters at Dover Air Force Base before flying on Monday that he felt ""great"" and again tested negative for COVID that morning. He was first cleared to leave isolation Sunday after testing negative for a second time following a so-called rebound case of the virus.

The president tested positive last month and, according to his doctor, experienced mild symptoms including a slight fever, cough and sore throat. He tested negative less than a week after that first positive test but received another positive test just days after that.

During his initial bout with COVID, Biden took Paxlovid, which is a key therapeutic for high-risk patients in preventing hospitalization and other severe outcomes. But it at times produces a rebound case after a patient finishes their course of treatment.

After he got the green light to leave isolation, Biden traveled to his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, before traveling Monday to Kentucky.

President Joe Biden said Monday morning that he ""not worried, but I'm concerned that they're moving as much as they are"" when asked about China's recent maneuvers around Taiwan, an island that China considers a breakaway territory.

""But I don't think they're going to do anything more,"" Biden said.

The U.S. does not officially support Taiwanese independence but maintains unofficial and military ties with Taiwan -- a decades-old strategy kinked by Pelosi's visit last week, the most high-level trip by an American in decades.

China has launched massive drills around Taiwan, including missile launches over the island and a substantial mobilization of its surrounding naval forces.

In response, Taiwan has said it will conduct its own live-fire artillery drills.

Pelosi, D-Calif., arrived in Taiwan on Aug. 2 intending to underscore Washington's commitment to Taipei but infuriated China. She also made appearances in Japan, South Korea and more during her trip and said she was focused on ""advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region.""

When asked about Pelosi going to Taiwan, which Biden previously said the military had concerns about, he only said Monday that ""that was her decision.""

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre expanded on Biden's remarks during a press gaggle later Monday, saying that he was uneasy over the chance that China may miscalculate some of its military drills -- and blunder into a broader problem.

""They [the maneuvers] are they are provocative, irresponsible and raise the risk of miscalculation,"" she said.

""We knew that the Chinese were going to react this way. We're going to communicate closely with our allies and partners and we're going to communicate that directly with Beijing,"" Jean-Pierre said.

It was not immediately clear at what level such conversations would take place. Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping last spoke on July 29 about tensions over Taiwan. The diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and China frayed further after Pelosi's trip, with China canceling its dialogue on climate and military issues and each country summoning the other's ambassador.

Colin Kahl, the Pentagon's top policy official, separately said Monday that he believes Beijing has been trying to ""coerce the international community"" into a ""manufactured"" conflict in Taiwan.

""We're not going to take the bait and it's not going to work. So it's a manufactured crisis, but that doesn't mean we have to play into that,"" he told reporters.

Washington's relationship with Taipei is dictated in part by the Taiwan Relations Act, which mandates that the U.S. bolster Taiwan's defenses. However, the U.S. also operates with ""strategic ambiguity"" on the island's conflict with China.

""What's important for us right now is to make sure that Beijing understands that our forces in the region will continue to operate, to fly, to sail wherever international waters allows,"" Kahl said. ""We will continue to stand by our allies and partners ... even as China tries to kind of chip away at the status quo.""

Secretary of State Antony Blinken also weighed in on Monday, saying at a press conference, ""The reaction now by China with regard to Taiwan and the military actions it's taken, allegedly in response to the peaceful visit of a member of our of our Congress -- that too doesn't help things, nor does the fact that China has been ceasing cooperation with the United States on dealing with climate change.""

""That's not punishing the United States, that's punishing the entire the entire world,"" Blinken said.

Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas joined ABC News on GMA3 to discuss the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping climate, tax and health care package that the Senate passed over the weekend. The bill is now set for a vote in the House this week.

GMA3: So many American families are in a financial crisis right now. Tell us what makes this bill historic and what it's actually going to do for those families who need some relief?

ALLRED: Well, it's going to help you lower the cost of your health care. For the first time in so long, that we've been pushing for this, Medicare is going to have the ability to negotiate to lower the cost of prescription drugs. And it will be the drugs that we don't have the market mechanisms to hold down the costs… So those are the ones that are really hitting families the hardest.

The Senate vote on the Inflation Reduction Act is seen in a still from video from the the Capitol, Aug. 7, 2022. senate.gov

It's also going to make sure that, if you're using the individual market, that your rates stay low. That's something we started in the American Rescue Plan. It's extended those benefits.

But also for your homes, it's going to encourage you -- to give you tax credits toward getting more efficient energy use in your home, but also more efficient energy grids. So it should lower your costs overall in terms of what you'll be paying to keep the lights on and the AC on, which we're needing a lot of here in Texas right now.

GMA3: It is called the Inflation Reduction Act. You didn't mention inflation in that answer… So are you comfortable selling this to your constituents as something that's going to bring down inflation?

ALLRED: Well, it lowers costs. And that's also a way of combating inflation, because when you have to spend more in some areas, if you can lower costs in other areas, that's basically the same thing in terms of balancing out your budget and trying to help working families get by.

I was raised by a single mother who was a public school teacher here in Dallas. I know what it's like to go to the store and wonder, are you going to be able to get all the things you need for the week? And so this is what we're trying to do, is find areas that we can control, where we can lower your costs.

So much of what we're dealing with in terms of inflation is a global issue that's happening around the world caused by the pandemic and also the war that Russia [caused by] invading Ukraine.

So there's some things that we can't control. The areas where we can, that's what we should target. And that's all we're trying to do here.

GMA3: How confident are you that this bill will make it to the president soon and in its current form? What still needs to be done?

ALLRED: Well, now that it's gotten through the Senate, we have to get it through the House. And there's always going to be some back and forth with my colleagues. That's just the way that the House works. But I do think that we'll pass it this week and send it to the president's desk.

UNITED STATES - JUNE 24: Rep. Colin Allred speaks during a press conference in Washington, June 24, 2020. CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images, FILE

This is a huge win for President Biden but, more importantly, for the American people. This is the biggest investment that we've ever made in combating climate change.

[The bill is] going to allow us to do so many things that we need to do to try and really head off what we know is a coming climate disaster for us down the road.

GMA3: Congressman, while we have you here… Brittney Griner, who is still being held in prison in Russia… Are you comfortable right now, relatively speaking, with where this process is?

ALLRED: Yeah, well, listen, I've known of Brittney since she was in high school when I was playing football at Baylor University. And she was a standout basketball player in Houston. And we were going to try and recruit her to come to Baylor to be part of our incredible women's basketball team, which she eventually did. And she's one of the best basketball players in the world. She's a Texan, and she's somebody who we're working extremely hard to get home.

Everybody should just know that the trial, so to speak, that you just saw was a sham. In Russia, if you reach that point, you have about a 98% chance that you're going to be convicted. So it's not really a trial.

And also that she was held, and is still being held, basically to exert pressure on the United States. And so we are doing everything we can to get her and Paul Whelan home.

But I actually do think that it's a positive that we're through the trial and sentencing phase, because we've known from the beginning that the Russians weren't going to seriously discuss a swap with us until that happens.

So as sad as it's been to see her receive a nine-year sentence and all of those things and to see the stress that she's been under, it also means that we are closer to getting her home."

The TAKE with Rick Klein

In an era where major events are happening virtually all the time, sometimes the headline comes out of what doesn't change.

The latest ABC News/Ipsos poll shows President Joe Biden stuck in a rut carved by perceptions of the economy. His approval ratings across a range of issues -- handling of inflation and taxes and even climate change and gun violence -- are all underwater and virtually unchanged since June or, in the case of inflation (29% approval), since the beginning of the year.

That's despite easing gas prices, encouraging jobs numbers and -- as of Sunday -- congressional action on a major health care, tax and environmental package cobbled together under the promise of addressing inflation.

The latest numbers come at a strange moment for Biden. Some Democrats are openly questioning whether he should or will run for reelection in 2024, even as the consensus on the president's accomplishments is likely to change with the surprise passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Maureen Dowd's latest New York Times op-ed arguing that Biden would be stronger as a lame duck -- ""he and his team could do what they thought was right rather than what was politically expedient"" -- adds to an awkward intra-party conversation.

On ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday, close Biden ally Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., brushed aside Dowd's column and predicted that ""a whole string of wins"" would start to change the midterm outlook. But even he wouldn't directly say whether he was urging Biden to run again, confirming only that he wants Biden to focus on more immediate challenges facing American families.

Democrats have all but resigned themselves to a midterm cycle where Biden is deeply unpopular. But in an election year where every point matters, just how stuck he is could mean seats in the House and Senate.

The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper

With less than 100 days until general election votes are tallied, former President Donald Trump's continued hints at a 2024 bid stand to energize Democratic voters in key elections.

Trump remains a powerful force within right-wing circles, as evidenced by the Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll that showed Trump as the clearly favored candidate for 2024.

When Trump spoke to the crowd at CPAC, he indicated that he ""may have to do it again"" and told reporters the ""time is coming"" for a formal campaign announcement.

""I think people are going to be very happy,"" Trump told Fox News Digital at CPAC.

It comes as the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll shows a shrinking enthusiasm gap between Democrat and Republican voters. When asked how enthusiastic they were about voting in November, the poll found that 75% of Republicans are either very or somewhat enthusiastic about voting, compared to 68% of Democrats.

In ABC News/Ipsos polls conducted in April and June this year, Republicans were likelier to report that they were very enthusiastic about voting than Democrats. That gap has narrowed to five points in this August poll.

An announcement could fuel voters who oppose Trump to cast midterm ballots in swing states where control of Congress is at stake.

The TIP with Alisa Wiersema

Nearly a week after voters cast ballots in a slate of high-profile August primary races, the contours of Republican intraparty divisions ahead of November are coming into view.

In Washington state, Rep. Dan Newhouse -- one of 10 House Republicans to vote in favor of the impeachment of former President Donald Trump -- advanced to the general election over the weekend alongside Democrat Doug White. The development is likely to put Newhouse on track to retain his seat in Congress, as two of his fellow pro-impeachment colleagues have already lost to Trump-backed challengers this primary season.

But Newhouse could be one of just two Republicans to come out on top -- four other GOP lawmakers who backed impeachment chose to resign rather than face voters this year, and the fates of Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Liz Cheney are still unknown.

Meanwhile, Arizona saw a Trump-endorsement sweep in statewide races. Former TV news anchor Kari Lake beat her Republican opponent, Karrin Taylor Robson, despite Robson having the backing of term-limited Gov. Doug Ducey and former Vice President Mike Pence.

Far-right Arizona House legislator Mark Finchem also topped Ducey's pick in the race for secretary of state. The outcome puts Finchem -- who denies the outcome of the 2020 election and attended the Jan. 6 rally preceding the Capitol riot -- on track to potentially become the state's top-ranking election official.

""We may have won this battle -- and I won an epic battle in Arizona. We drove a stake through the heart of the McCain machine,"" Lake said to applause during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday.

4. That's the number of GOP primaries and elections we're watching on Tuesday in Minnesota and Wisconsin. And as FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich writes, Minnesota's special election in the 1st Congressional District could be especially important as its margins will help us better understand whether Democrats -- or Republicans -- have an advantage headed into the 2022 midterms. So far it's been a mixed bag, but in recent weeks the race for Congress has inched toward Democrats in the polls. Wisconsin also has two statewide races, for governor and attorney general, where Republicans are hoping to make inroads. We'll be back Monday with our preview of the key Democratic races to watch in Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin.

However, because of the district's unique status under Congress, abortion access has other caveats.
""Despite the Left's lie that women have a constitutional right to abortion, the Constitution clearly secures an unalienable right to live — but it does not provide a right to abortion.""
D.C. Councilmember Nadeau told ABC News there were larger challenges to removing the area's autonomy.","The district has limited autonomy under a Congress that could soon be GOP-led.

Roe v. Wade's overturning in June returned the regulation -- or banning -- of abortion to individual states and at least 15 states have since ceased nearly all abortion services.

However, there are some questions about decidedly non-state Washington, D.C.

As a federal district, it operates under the 1973 Home Rule Act, which provides certain authority to the D.C. mayor and 13 elected councilmembers but reserves for Congress the ultimate power to govern.

D.C. has some of the least restrictive abortion laws in the country: It is legal for all stages of pregnancy. However, because of the district's unique status under Congress, abortion access has other caveats. Medicaid funding, for example, cannot be used as it can in states.

With the Republican Party hoping to retake the House and Senate in November -- a likely outcome at least in the House, according to FiveThirtyEight -- some conservative lawmakers have openly mused about trying to repeal the district's limited autonomy and abortion access along with it.

In past attempts to restrict abortions in the district, local councilmembers could rely on Roe as a legal barricade. The post-Roe future is more uncertain.

The most outspoken opponent of home rule is Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., who said in February he planned to introduce legislation to effectively dissolve what he deemed a ""failed experiment.""

""My forthcoming legislation to repeal D.C.'s Home Rule Act will follow and uphold the Constitution, period,"" Clyde told Politico in June, after the Supreme Court reversed Roe. ""Despite the Left's lie that women have a constitutional right to abortion, the Constitution clearly secures an unalienable right to live — but it does not provide a right to abortion.""

D.C. Councilmember Brianne Nadeau said the proposals by Clyde and other conservatives called for heightened caution from local officials.

""Whenever a Republican member of Congress mentions [ending home rule], I think we have to be prepared to protect our residents' rights from being curtailed,"" Nadeau told ABC News.

On May 6, in the wake of the leak of a draft of the Supreme Court's majority opinion striking down Roe, Nadeau introduced the Humans Rights Sanctuary Amendment Act of 2022. She called it a needed protection. If passed, it would prevent the district from cooperating in out-of-state investigations with the goal to impose criminal or civil liability for abortion, contraception use and other protected conduct.

""My bill also anticipates further action by the Supreme Court that might prevent people from upholding their marriage or receiving gender-affirming care,"" Nadeau said. ""If there's a same-sex couple or a trans child who needs lifesaving health care, I want to make sure that D.C. has already contemplated that future need for proper protection.""

Nadeau's proposal also includes a countermeasure -- a private right of action -- against state laws that empower plaintiffs to sue people they suspect are connected to illegal abortions, such as the novel Texas law passed in 2021.

Nadeau's bill is modeled on Connecticut's Reproductive Freedom Defense Act, signed into law in May, which shields abortion seekers from out-of-state scrutiny and state clinicians from lawsuits from out-of-state plaintiffs.

The D.C. Council held a public hearing related to reproductive health care on July 14, in which Kate Vlach, the policy director for the Office of the D.C. Attorney General, said district clinicians were ""uncertain if they might face criminal prosecution for providing services"" to out-of-state abortion seekers.

Meanwhile, the district's non-voting delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, has called on Congress to reconsider statehood and codify abortion into federal law -- both dim prospects given GOP opposition, Democrats' narrow majorities and moderates' support for the Senate filibuster.

Ward One Councilmember Brianne Nadeau speaks during the 2015 District of Columbia Inauguration ceremony at the Convention Center in Washington, Jan. 2, 2015. Carolyn Kaster/AP, FILE

At a House Oversight Committee hearing on July 13, Norton urged: ""Statehood is the best way for D.C. to protect abortion access for its residents.""

A repeal of the decades-old home rule or a crackdown on D.C.'s abortion access are also slim in the short term: Clyde's plan has not risen to leadership level. Kentucky Republican Rep. James Comer, the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, told Axios last month: ""There have been no discussions committee-wide on this. This is an Andrew Clyde project that he feels very passionate about.""

D.C. Councilmember Nadeau told ABC News there were larger challenges to removing the area's autonomy.

""It's not that simple to take over a district that has had a local government for more than 40 years, and then have no other plan for it,"" she argued. ""I think this difficulty will be a hard deterrent [for the Republican Party] to overcome."""

Hundreds of thousands of dollars in new funding are set to be given out this week to community organizations as part of a major anti-gun violence organization's latest nationwide efforts.

Everytown for Gun Safety is distributing $1.5 million to a select collection of local nonprofit groups working to stop gun violence in their areas before it happens, Everytown officials tell ABC News.

""There are more guns now than there were last year and the year before that -- and we know that when there are more guns, there's more violence,"" said Michael-Sean Spence, Everytown's director of community safety initiatives. ""So we have to work and we have to support community leaders who are doing this work and have been doing this work for decades.""

The grants, which come as part of a $25 million commitment that Everytown made last year, further expand the organizational reach throughout the U.S. with the addition of program support in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Antonio, Texas.

Recipients also include groups in Charleston, South Carolina; Denver; Madison, Wisconsin; Miami and more.

There have been more than 400 mass shootings so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Nearly 700 mass shooting were recorded by the archive in 2021.

Spence and his team at Everytown see the need to strengthen organizations with deep community ties that are capable of performing triage to areas destabilized by violent acts, he said.

""Of course, those are tragic incidents that immediately capture the zeitgeist, but we can't forget the fact that these same community-based violence intervention programs are also showing up to those scenes,"" Spence said. ""And they're also providing direct support to the families impacted by these mass shootings. They're staying on the scene for weeks at a time preventing additional violence from occurring.""

Warees Majeed, co-founder of the Washington, D.C.-based community support group Yaay Me!, works with both perpetrators and victims of gun violence to institute behavioral changes that steer disadvantaged youth away from firearms.

""We show people how valuable they are, how valuable their communities are, how valuable their families are,"" Majeed told ABC News. ""And once we do that, we see individuals literally transform.""

Strategic outreach to offenders and potential offenders allows community leaders to directly communicate the incentives and disincentives ultimately enforced by authorities, advocates say. A 2012 research review of 10 programs that employed a similar deterrence approach found a statistically significant reduction in crime.

Likewise, a 2019 study of street gangs in Oakland, California, also found a significant reduction in shootings in places where specific gangs were contacted and assisted by community-based intervention groups.

""We focus on pathways to self-sufficiency,"" Majeed said. ""So, trying to take an individual from being in crisis and hopefully getting them to a safe, stable place and then, eventually, hopefully thriving,""

While these community-based efforts represent more of a public health approach to violence prevention, Majeed said engaging local police is a critical part of their mission, too.

The cap, which was proposed by Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., needed 60 votes to pass and remain in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The cap's scrapping was quickly seized on by Democrats and stirred controversy beyond them, with critics of the GOP citing the sometimes startling cost of needed insulin for diabetics.
Republicans, in turn, accused Democrats of being misleading about a vote that they said amounted to a technicality rather than a policy difference.
The parliamentarian, meanwhile, did allow Warnock’s $35 insulin cap to apply to those covered under Medicare.","The parliamentarian had said the limit violated the reconciliation process.

Nearly uniform Republican opposition in the Senate on Sunday stripped a proposed cap on insulin prices in private insurance from Democrats' party-line climate, health and tax bill.

Democrats had sought to overrule a decision from the Senate rules official, the parliamentarian, that a $35-per-month limit on insulin costs under private insurances did not comply with the budget reconciliation process, which allowed Democrats to pass their bill with a bare majority.

The cap, which was proposed by Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., needed 60 votes to pass and remain in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). It ultimately failed by a 57-43 vote.

Republicans Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan voted for the measure with Democrats. All 43 ""no"" votes came from Republicans.

The cap's scrapping was quickly seized on by Democrats and stirred controversy beyond them, with critics of the GOP citing the sometimes startling cost of needed insulin for diabetics.

Republicans, in turn, accused Democrats of being misleading about a vote that they said amounted to a technicality rather than a policy difference.

""Lying Dems and their friends in corporate media are at it again, distorting a Democrat 'gotcha' vote. In reality, the Dems wanted to break Senate rules to pass insulin pricing cap instead of going through regular order,"" Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson tweeted afterward, noting that he previously ""voted for an amendment, that Dems blocked, to provide insulin at cost to low-income Americans.""

While the proposed cap was not expected to get the 10 Republicans needed to have the measure preserved as part of the Democrats' sprawling reconciliation deal -- the 60-vote threshold would have overcome the parliamentarian's objections about using the 51-vote reconciliation -- the process allowed the party to put GOP senators on the record on a popular policy.

Republicans used a similar tactic in voting on Biden's immigration policy as part of possible amendments to the IRA.

The parliamentarian had said the insulin cap would violate the Byrd Rule, which requires that a measure have an effect on the federal budget that is not ""merely incidental"" in order to qualify to pass through reconciliation.

The parliamentarian, meanwhile, did allow Warnock’s $35 insulin cap to apply to those covered under Medicare."

The Senate on Sunday passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) along party lines, 51-50, handing Democrats a crucial legislative win as the midterm cycle ramps up -- despite GOP objections at the billions in spending and drug pricing reforms.

The sprawling climate, tax and health care legislation is now set up for quick passage in the Democratic-controlled House, with timing still to be announced, before President Joe Biden signs it into law.

Included in the bill, supporters are quick to highlight, are measures to foster job creation, raise taxes on large corporations and the wealthy, allow Medicare to negotiate down some prescription drug costs, expand the Affordable Care Act health care program and invest in combating climate change by implementing tax credits for clean energy initiatives, among other things.

Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate with all Democrats in support of the legislation and all Republicans opposed.

As she left the Senate floor, Harris stopped to speak with ABC News. ""This is a great day. … There is a tremendous amount of work that has happened here,"" Harris said. ""That has been about lifting up the condition and the quality of life for the American people. And in particular, addressing the cost of so many of the essential needs that people have.""

The proposal was passed via the budget reconciliation process, which requires a simple majority rather than the 60 votes typically needed to overcome a filibuster.

The rules of reconciliation, however, limit what can and cannot be passed with 51 votes -- strictures that narrowed the legislation's scope even in the final days before the vote.

The legislation's tax provisions, prescription drug-pricing reform, as well as boosted IRS tax enforcement measures, are anticipated to raise an estimated revenue of $739 billion -- $300 billion of which Democrats say would go toward reducing the deficit.

The plan would reduce federal budget deficits by $102 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Despite the bill's name, however, the CBO found that it would have a minimal affect on high inflation in the short-term -- something Democrats have conceded when pressed.

The bill passed the Senate after a punishing, approximately 16-hour ""vote-a-rama,"" in which any senator could introduce an amendment to the bill as part of the reconciliation process.

The amendment process fueled painful votes for each party.

Vulnerable Democratic incumbents up for reelection this year had to dance around a vote on the Biden administration's decision to scrap Title 42, a Trump-era order using coronavirus concerns to prevent migrants from entering the country while seeking asylum. Republicans, meanwhile, mostly voted against a Democratic amendment that would have capped out-of-pocket insulin costs at $35 a month for people with private health insurance.

The IRA passage marks the culmination of grueling negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who had been a consistent obstacle to cobbling together a Democrats-only social spending bill via reconciliation.

The pathway for a successful vote was cemented late last week when Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., another key centrist, signed on after winning some tweaks to the bill.

Among the changes Sinema won were the eliminations of tax provisions targeting wealthy hedge-fund managers and private equity executives. The Senate rules official, the parliamentarian, also scrapped a provision intended to reprimand drug companies that raise the prices of some prescription drugs faster than inflation for patients with private insurance.

Still, the bill's passage marks a major step toward President Biden's campaign promises to tackle climate change, reform drug pricing and other issues; and it gives Democrats a new legislative win to run on heading into the November midterms, in an environment where many voters have soured on Biden's handling of the economy and historic inflation.

""Today, Senate Democrats sided with American families over special interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance, and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit, while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share. I ran for President promising to make government work for working families again, and that is what this bill does -- period,"" Biden said in a statement.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi vowed to quickly reconvene the lower chamber to approve the IRA and send it on to Biden for his signature.

The IRA extends a streak of achievements for Biden and congressional Democrats, including passage of a bipartisan anti-gun violence bill and legislation to boost the domestic semiconductor industry.

""This bill is going to change America for decades,"" Schumer crowed after final passage.

In brief remarks to reporters later Sunday, an exuberant Schumer -- in his ""lucky blue suit"" -- celebrated his party's ""persistence"" in getting the legislation across the finish line.

Schumer acknowledged that Democrats had faced ""many bumps in the road"" on their path to passing the reconciliation package but he celebrated provisions that he said would make the world a ""better place for my grandchildren.""

As his party prepares to face voters in November, Schumer promised that Americans would begin to see the effects of this and other legislative efforts soon.

""This is why this bill is so exciting in a political way. They're going see Democrats who are actually getting things done that matter to them, mainstream things that average folks -- this is not an esoteric list,"" Schumer said. ""This is things that people have always cared about.""

The vice president was also asked after the vote about the potential effects on the midterms and told reporters: ""What it means is that right now, regardless of an election, that the American people are being seen and they're being heard.""

Republicans, for their part, have already forecasted that they'll paint Democrats as uncaring about Americans' financial burdens at a time of rapid price hikes while passing billions of dollars in new spending.

""This idea that this massive tax increase will just somehow be absorbed by corporate America when they will pass those costs along to consumers, and it will make inflation worse,"" Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said last week.

In a statement Sunday after the vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said, in part: ""The last time Senate Democrats tried to remake the economy on party lines, they shoved American families into the worst inflation in 40 years. Democrats got all-you-can-eat liberal spending and working families got stuck with the bill.""

""Democrats' policies have torn down the savings, the stability, and the lifestyles that families worked and sacrificed for years to build up. The effect of this one-party government has been an economic assault on the American middle class,"" McConnell said.

Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said on ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday that the IRA would be not a boon to the country but a ""boondoggle.""

""What they're really trying to do is to take dollars in and then redistribute it back out to the places that they think it should be done … This is not the time to be experimenting in that area,"" he said.

He also contended that Medicare's drug negotiating power wouldn't pay off: ""This is not healthy, it's not good and it will cause problems in the marketplace.""

Republican South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds on Sunday labeled the impending passage of a Democratic tax, climate and health bill as a ""boondoggle"" for the country.

Rounds was responding to ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos, who asked him in an exclusive interview immediately after Delaware Democrat Chris Coons appeared: ""We just heard Sen. Coons say that this bill is going to be a boon to consumers, a boon for the economy. Your response?""

Rounds pushed back on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a proposal Democrats said would reduce the deficit, support clean energy and lower drug costs, in part by increasing corporate taxes.

""It's not going to do much to help inflation, we're still gonna have a problem there,"" Rounds told Stephanopoulos.

He also disagreed with a congressional Joint Committee on Taxation analysis showing that the bill would not raise taxes, increase spending over the long term or put an additional tax burden on families making less than $400,000.

He contended that Americans would be impacted as broader costs are levied on the economy and corporations raise prices.

""We will see those tax increases coming down the line and Americans are gonna feel it,"" Rounds said. ""The bottom line on this is that what they're really trying to do is to take dollars in and then redistribute it back out to the places that they think it should be done … This is not the time to be experimenting in that area.""

One key provision of the IRA would allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices on some prescription drugs, with a proposition to cap out-of-pocket spending at $2,000.

Rounds cast Medicare's potential negotiating power another way.

""First of all, it doesn't start for four years. And second of all, once it does start, what do you think the drug companies are going to be doing when they start being dictated to?"" he told Stephanopoulos. ""This is not healthy, it's not good and it will cause problems in the marketplace.""

Stephanopoulos followed up on Rounds' concerns of a recession, pointing to the latest report from the Labor Department that U.S. employers added an unexpectedly robust 528,000 jobs in July as the unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5%. That is the lowest in the last 50 years.

But Rounds insisted he and other Republicans had reservations.

""What you're actually seeing, we believe, might be a precursor to what's to come. You're going to find out the larger companies such as Walmart are talking about starting to reduce the number of people that they're going to be employing,"" he said.

""So while it's good and we want to see job growth, I don't think we can necessarily say that that is not a precursor yet to probably some more serious economic issues coming very shortly,"" he said.

With the midterm elections only months away, Rounds said his focus was on 2022 -- not on 2024, as Stephanopoulos raised the possibility of former President Donald Trump running again for the White House.

Nonetheless, Rounds said he expected a ""wide open field"" in the next Republican presidential primary. ""Let's see who else is coming up,"" he said.

""You want [Trump] to wait until after the midterms to announce?"" Stephanopoulos asked.

""Most certainly. I think that would be good, because I think Democrats would like to have him draw attention away from the 2022,"" Rounds said. ""We have to have a good strong showing in the 2022 … and then we'll have divided government, but at least we'll be able to slow down some of these rather radical ideas that they're putting out right now.""

Stephanopoulos also asked Rounds for his view on a proposed pro-abortion access amendment in his home state in light of last week's resounding defeat of an anti-abortion amendment in Kansas, another Republican stronghold.

""[Abortion access] is back where it should be and that is back to the states, and then we'll let the people and the legislative body decide exactly what they think is the long-term approach. Me personally, I am pro-life. I believe that abortion is wrong,"" Rounds said."

Basketball star Brittney Griner and former Marine Paul Whelan should hopefully be released from Russia as part of a ""two-for-two"" prisoner swap, former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson said Sunday.

""My view is optimistic, I think she's gonna be free. There's gonna be a prisoner swap -- I think it's gonna be two-for-two. Can't forget about Paul Whelan,"" Richardson, who is an outside adviser involved in Griner's case, said in an exclusive interview with ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos.

Griner has been detained since February and was sentenced last week to nine years in prison after she was found guilty of drug charges in a Moscow-area court; she has said she accidentally traveled with vape cartridges containing hashish oil.

Whelan, who worked in corporate security after the Marines, was convicted of espionage -- which he and the U.S. deny.

Late last month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken revealed the administration had made a ""substantial proposal"" to release Griner and Whelan, which sources told ABC News included freeing notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence in the U.S.

Richardson said Sunday that he didn't fully agree with the Biden administration's messaging strategy. ""I wouldn't have gone public as much as they did,"" he said.

But, he said, sometimes comments about prisoner negotiations are made strategically when talks stall: ""You want to throw a little bit of a bomb, and I think that's what they did.""

Richardson described himself as a ""catalyst"" working on Griner's case, along with other detainees. ""I've been talking to the Russians. I talked to the White House,"" he said, though he would not detail specifics of his communications.

The founder of the Richardson Center for Global Engagement -- which ""promotes global peace and dialogue,"" according to the center's website -- Richardson recently helped free U.S. journalist Danny Fenster in Myanmar, he said. He was also involved in helping free ex-Marine Trevor Reed, who was released by Russia in April in another prisoner exchange.

Stephanopoulos questioned Richardson about why, in its comments on Griner and Whelan, the White House has publicly omitted Marc Fogel, an American educator held in Russia since August 2021.

""He's facing a prison sentence right now. His infraction was similar to Brittney Griner's. Shouldn't he be included in this?"" Stephanopoulos asked.

""All of these that are wrongfully detained need to come home. And our objective should be, despite prisoner exchanges that are not popular, to bring American hostages home,"" Richardson said. ""Some of these prisoner exchanges are not good. They don't -- the optics are not good. But we have to do it sometimes.""

Stephanopoulos followed up to ask if such trades ""will encourage America's adversaries to actually detain more Americans""?

""There's no data that supports that,"" Richardson said. He cited the case of Fenster: ""All they wanted was a photo-op. So data doesn't support that prisoner exchanges are always the case. Yes, they're increasing, especially with countries like Iran, Venezuela, Russia. But as unpleasant as they are, we have to bring American hostages home.""

Blinken said in late July he had spoken with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, to try and push forward on negotiations.

Richardson on Sunday complimented Lavrov's role in the issue.

""Lavrov, he and I were U.N. ambassadors together at the same time,"" Richardson said. ""And I'm pleased that he's pragmatic, that he's sort of in charge and sent a good signal. I think the negotiations are going to be undertaken."""

Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, one of President Joe Biden's closest allies, said Sunday he was confident the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) would pass -- but conceded that any impact the legislation has on inflation would not be immediate.

""I have no doubts at all,"" Coons told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos when asked if he thought the party-line tax, climate and health care package would be approved amid a marathon series of amendment votes that was still ongoing as of late Sunday morning.

""The Democrats in our Senate caucus have stayed unified throughout the night,"" Coons said. ""Every single amendment vote of the dozens we've taken so far -- we've defeated Republican efforts to knock down this important, even landmark, piece of legislation that will reduce prescription drug prices, reduce health care costs, reduce the deficit and make a big down payment on combating climate change.""

Stephanopoulos pressed Coons on the Democratic argument about deflation, which is key to how the package is branded.

The Congressional Budget Office has said it would have a “negligible impact” on inflation in the short term.

""Is it really fair to call it the Inflation Reduction Act?"" Stephanopoulos asked.

""This is going to reduce the costs that hit American families in their pocketbook ... It’s going to make for a more secure and stable and cleaner and more affordable future for American families,"" Coons argued.

Still, on the timeline for inflation to be reduced, he admitted that ""it may take a year or more"" and said, ""We may not see huge impacts on inflation in the first or second year.""

""Yes, inflation is higher than it should be. But we just got a robust jobs number of more than 500,000 jobs created this past month,"" Coons said. ""Unemployment, the lowest it's been in my lifetime. And I think we've got a strong recovery underway.""

Stephanopoulos noted criticism even among some Democratic allies over the IRA, which was the product of a deal between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and moderate Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took to the Senate floor twice last week to criticize the bill, saying in one speech that the legislation ""does virtually nothing to address the enormous crises facing the working families of our country.""

""I understand that Sen. Sanders has a different view than virtually everyone else in our caucus, but I am confident in the end he will vote for it,"" Coons said on ""This Week.""

Stephanopoulos asked if Coons had concerns that the IRA would be used in Republican campaigns, given their criticism of Biden's handling of the economy, which has been a key part of voters' disapproval of the president.

""Republicans attack it as a big spending bill, and it appears their midterm strategy is to focus on inflation,"" Stephanopoulos said.

Coons defended the Democrats' record, highlighting ""a whole string of significant accomplishments in recent weeks"": not just the IRA but billions in funding for domestic manufacturing of computer chips and new health care support for veterans, both of which were bipartisan measures, and the successful drone strike on an al-Qaeda leader.

In light of that, though, Stephanopoulos followed up to ask Coons about the small but increasingly loud chorus of Democratic voices who say Biden should not run for reelection in 2024, when he would be in his 80s. Coons, who holds Biden's old Senate seat, said he was ""encouraging [Biden] to focus on what’s right in front of us.""

""I think he’s got a strong record of accomplishment to run on. All the different initiatives I just talked about here at home, but also real leadership on the world stage,"" said Coons, pointing to efforts in Europe, during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the Indo-Pacific.

""So, frankly, I'm hopeful that President Biden will run again,"" he added. ""If he does, I’ll certainly support him."""

""He will safely return to public engagement and presidential travel,"" O'Connor wrote in the letter.

Biden arrived in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Sunday morning -- his first travel out of Washington, D.C., since late July, when he first tested positive for COVID.

Biden tested negative for COVID-19 on Saturday after he experienced a rebound infection following his first positive test on July 21.

Biden's initial symptoms included a slight fever, cough and sore throat, among other mild symptoms. He isolated at the White House while completing a five-day course of Paxlovid, an antiviral treatment for those with mild to moderate symptoms who are considered a high risk for severe illness.

After the treatment, Biden tested negative. But the president tested positive again on July 30 in what O'Connor described as an example of ""rebound positivity"" from the course of Paxlovid.

Some patients who take Paxlovid can test positive again after finishing the treatment course, but those cases are uncommon. But high-risk patients who take Paxlovid still have a dramatically lower risk of being hospitalized due to the virus.

STEPHANOPOULOS (on camera): Good morning and welcome to ""This Week.""

As we come on the air this morning, Senate Democrats on the cusp of passing their climate, health care and tax bill, it cleared a key test vote yesterday. Votes on amendments have continued all through the night.

The sweeping legislation funds the largest investment to fight climate change in U.S. history. It lowers prescription drug costs for Medicare; extends Obamacare subsidies; reduces the deficit a bit, and is financed with tax hikes on large corporations.

It's called the Inflation Reduction Act. That's something of an open question as is the impact the legislation will have on the looming midterms where Republicans are poised for a potential takeover of Congress.

Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Republican Mike Rounds are here to discuss it all.

And Senator Coons, let’s start with you. Good morning. I know you’ve had a long, long night. Not much sleep. You’ve been voting all through the night. No surprises so far. Any doubt this is going to pass?

SEN. CHRIS COONS, (D-DE): I have no doubts at all, George. The Democrats in our Senate Caucus have stayed unified throughout the night, every single amendment vote of the dozens we've taken so far we've defeated Republican efforts to knock down this important, even landmark, piece of legislation that will reduce prescription drug prices, reduce healthcare costs, reduce the deficit and make a big down payment on combatting climate change.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You call the bill the Inflation Reduction Act but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the bill is going to have a negligible effect on inflation this year, barely any impact in 2023, between 0.1 percent lower and 0.1 higher. So is it really fair to call it the Inflation Reduction Act?

COONS: Yes, it is, George. This is going to reduce the costs that hit American families in their pocketbook. Prescription drug costs, healthcare costs, energy costs. It's going to make for a more secure and stable and cleaner and more affordable future for American families, and while we may not see huge impacts on inflation in the first or second year, Treasury secretaries who’ve served in both Democratic and Republican administrations support this bill and the AARP, who I trust as the voice of seniors in America, says this will make a big impact on prescription drug prices.

STEPHANOPOULOS: How long is going to take to reduce inflation?

COONS: It may take a year or more. But look, George, we’ve seen gas prices come down week after week after week for the last five weeks in a row. Gas in Delaware is now below $4. Yes, inflation is higher than it should be but we just got a robust jobs number, more than 500,000 jobs created in this past month, unemployment is the lowest it’s been in my lifetime and I think we've got a strong economy, a strong recovery under way.

STEPHANOPOULOS: What's your argument to fellow Democrats like Bernie Sanders who call the bill a disappointment, say that it fails to meet the moment?

COONS: Well, Senator Sanders, my colleague from Vermont, has offered several amendments over last night and into this morning and every one of them has failed by very wide margins, either 97 or 98 to 1 or 2.

I understand that Senator Sanders has a different view than virtually everyone else in our caucus but I am confident in the end he will vote for it and this will be one of the biggest investments we've ever made in reducing the deficit, in combating the costs that matter to working families, and in tackling climate change.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Meantime, you’ve got Republicans attacking it as a big spending bill, and it appears their midterm strategy is to focus on inflation, tie your candidates to President Biden, who’s approval ratings, as you know, are stuck in the 30s. How worried are you that that's going to work? What should President Biden do about it?

COONS: I don't think it's going to work, because President Biden and the Democrats in Congress have gotten a whole string of significant accomplishments in recent weeks.

President Biden is soon going to sign into law the biggest veterans’ health care bill we’ve ever done, that deals with burn pit injuries for those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He's about to sign the chips package, a bipartisan bill that makes significant investments in onshoring and bringing back to the United States advanced manufacturing in things like semiconductor chips.

He also ordered the strike that killed the leader of al-Qaeda and recently presided over some great jobs news, as I just said. I'm confident this bill will get to his desk.

Last point, we just passed here in recent days a guns and mental health bill that's going to invest $13 billion in community mental health. This is a whole string of wins that impact issues that really matter to American families.

STEPHANOPOULOS: It is quite a winning streak, at the same time, as you know -- and you’re one of the president’s closest friends in the Senate, he is facing some grumbling, some talk in the Democratic Party that perhaps he should step aside, not run in 2024. Maureen Dowd has a column in “The New York Times” this morning, saying, “Hey, Joe, Don’t Give It a Go.” She says this winning streak is exactly the right time for the president to step aside, declare victory, and clear the way for a new generation of Democrats.

What's your response to that argument?

COONS: Well, George, all the Democrats who are coming to these bill signings, I hope, are also going to sign up to continue to support our president.

You're right, I was one of folks who was first in supporting now President Biden when he was candidate Biden and I think he's done good things for our country. I think he’s got a strong record of accomplishments to run on. All the different initiatives I just talked about here at home, but also real leadership on the world stage.

He pulled together our NATO allies, our European partners to stand up to Russian aggression in Ukraine and he strengthened our alliances in the Indo-Pacific, so frankly, I'm hopeful that President Biden will run again. If he does, I’ll certainly support him.

STEPHANOPOULOS: So no doubt, you -- are you encouraging him to run again?

COONS: I'm encouraging him to focus on what's right in front of us. What I know President Biden stays up at night worrying about, which is American families. The conversations they have at night around the kitchen table about the costs they’re facing, about opportunity, about their kids' futures.

This legislation that we're moving through today in the Senate is about those sort of things, combatting climate change for our kids and our grandkids, reducing prescription drug prices for our families and our parents, that's the sort of thing that President Biden is focused on and I know he’s going to keep making those sort of differences for America’s families.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Coons, thanks for your time this morning.

COONS: Thank you, George.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Now a Republican view. Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota.

Senator, thank you for joining us this morning. I know you’ve had a long night as well. We just heard Senator Coons say that this bill is going to be a boon to consumers, a boon for the economy. Your response?

SEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD): I think he was partially right. Should have said boondoggle. In this particular case it’s not going to do much to help inflation. We’re still going to have a problem there. And yet at the same time, they’re going to be collecting about -- real close to $740 billion in new tax revenue over the next supposedly 5 to 10 years, but most certainly it’s not going to help get us through a tight time in which we’re worried about coming out of a recession.

We’ve got two quarters in a row with declining GDP. This is not the time to raise taxes and most certainly it’s not the time in which we start adding additional government employees. We’re talking 87,000 more IRS employees. I don’t think very many American citizens are going to want to see that.

STEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, the Joint Tax Committee found that the bill will not raise taxes or increase spending over the long term and there is no tax increase for families under $400,000.

ROUNDS: Well, actually, we would disagree with that because it’s all passed down. And what you’re going to see are normal American families actually see the impact of what happens whenever you put new taxes on our economy.

Now they talk about it being on big corporations but as big corporation raise prices they do pass it all down. So from our perspective, we will see those tax increases coming down the line and Americans are going to feel it.

But the bottom line on this is that what they’re really trying to do is to take dollars and then redistribute it back out to the places that they think it should be done. And in this case, they’re looking at things that they want to do, primarily on climate change. This is not the time to be experimenting in that area.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, there are going to be tax breaks for energy as well. And as you know, that this -- there will be a lowering of prescription drug prices for people on Medicare. Those on Medicare tend to vote.

ROUNDS: Well, in this particular case, well, they've done two things.

First, they took -- they're taking dollars out of Medicare that would otherwise go to normal prescription drug prices. They’re putting it into subsidized Obamacare. And we understand that’s a product that they want to continue to subsidize. They’re going to take money from Medicare, put it into Obamacare.

But at the same time, they're saying that they’re going to tell the drug companies that you have to sell it for less to the federal government. First of all, it doesn't start for four years. And second of all, once it does start, what do you think the drug companies are going to be doing when they start being dictated to?

And, by the way, this is not a negotiation. This is what the federal government really walks in and says, if you want to provide any prescriptions here, we will tell you how much we will pay, period, end of story. And if you don't like it, there's a huge, huge tax burden that we will inflict upon you.

This is not healthy. It’s not good, and it will cost problems in the marketplace.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You talked about the possibility of a recession. We just saw that jobs report on Friday -- 528,000 new jobs in July, 3.5 unemployment. That's 50-year low.

ROUNDS: There are two parts that we want to remember. First of all, we know that our GDP has gone down the last two quarters. So, let's all recognize that that's accepted by everybody. That is down.

The second part is, is that, while we're very happy to see the jobs growth, a positive thing, remember that back in the 1970s, and moving into the 1980s, we actually saw job growth because unless your wages are keeping up with inflation, payrolls actually go down in value.

And so, what you're actually seeing we believe might be a precursor to what’s to come. You’re going to find out, the larger companies such as Walmart are already talking about starting to reduce the number of people that they’re going to be employing.

But in the meantime, if your wages, if you can save on wages because as inflation goes up, the value of wages is not as great as it was, unless it’s also going up at the same or greater rate -- well, then you can afford to have people stay on the payroll and your payroll actually goes down compared to what the products are that you're producing or that you're buying and moving to the market.

So, this is -- while it’s good and we want to see job growth, I don't think we can necessarily say that that is not a precursor yet to probably some serious economic issues coming very shortly.

We hope that we're building our way out of a recession but you don't do that by raising taxes. You do it by promoting and expanding businesses, getting the economy rolling again.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about the issue of abortion rights. We saw that vote in Kansas this week where voters rejecting an attempt to amend the Constitution in a way that would have undermined abortion rights. I know there's now a move to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot in South Dakota to protect abortion rights.

When you look at what happened in Kansas, do you think a ballot measure like that could pass in South Dakota?

ROUNDS: I think this is one that it’s going back to where it should, which is back to the people and back to the states. I like the idea of having people actually debate and discuss the issue. In South Dakota, we had a trigger law which we actually signed when I was governor, and it said that, basically, abortion was going to be illegal unless it was to save a life of the mother.

Now, I think the legislature can come back in. It’s now been 17 years since that trigger law was put into effect, and they'll be able to discuss it, debate it, take public testimony and come back what they think is the best, if they want a different alternative.

At the same time, in South Dakota, like other states, if a legislature does not do something which finds consensus, then there’s always the possibility of a referendum, or a referred measure, or an initiated measure.

So, it is back where it should be, and that is, it’s back to the states, and then we'll let the people and the legislative bodies decide exactly what they think is, you know, the long-term approach.

Me personally, I am pro-life. I believe that abortion is wrong. But this is an issue that the legislative bodies should take on, they should debate it, and they should decide what will be the test of time in each state.

STEPHANOPOULOS: President Trump signaled again last night at the CPAC conference that he's looking at a run for president in 2024. Your colleague, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, seems to be encouraging him to run.

Are you going to join in that effort?

ROUNDS: Well, on this particular case, I’m going to focus on the 2022 election. We've got to win that back. But I’ll hold my -- keep my powder dry for the 2024 run. Let’s see who else is coming up.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You want someone else?

ROUNDS: I most certainly think it's going to be a wide open field. You know, the one thing in the South -- in the Republican Party, we're going to be talking about the ideals, the principles moving forward.

Democrats right now would love to see President Trump announce before 2022. I think the reason why is because they’d like to have that draw attention away from the 2022 election and the candidates that they've got.

And the other thing here is, is that, right now, with President Biden as far under water as he is, their principles, their issues, the fact that inflation at over 9 percent, GDP is down, I think this is a good time for them to be trying to be looking at other things to talk about. And they’re not going to want to talk about the economy right now.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Am I – am I right to conclude from that, that whatever President Trump decides, you want him to wait until after the midterms to announce.

ROUNDS: Most certainly I think that would be good because I think the Democrats would like to have him draw attention away from the 2022. We have to have a good, strong showing in 2022. I feel very strongly about that because we’ve got to be able to take back the House and would love to take back the Senate as well, and then we’ll have divided government, but at least we’ll be able to slow down some of these rather radical ideas that they’re putting out right now.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Rounds, thanks for your time this morning.

ROUNDS: Thank you.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Coming up, Russia’s signaling it's ready to discuss a prisoner swap after sentencing Brittney Griner to nine years in a penal colony. Negotiator Bill Richardson joins us live.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): In the Congress, House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans are committed to the security of Taiwan.

We have to show the world -- and that's one of the purposes of our trip -- to show the world that success of the people of Taiwan, their courage -- their courage to change their own country to become more democratic.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defending her trip to Taiwan as diplomatic as military tensions rise between the United States and China. It was another consequential week for U.S. foreign policy with the assassination of al Qaeda’s leader and talk of a prisoner swap with Russia after Brittney Griner's sentencing.

Former U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson has been engaged on that issue. We're going to speak with him live in a minute after this report from senior foreign correspondent Ian Pannell.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

IAN PANNELL, ABC NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This week, a new crisis over the Taiwan Strait. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has visited the island triggering outrage in Beijing. Pelosi, the most senior U.S. official to visit the self-governing democracy for 25 years, ignoring China's warning she was playing with fire.

Even before she landed, China suddenly announcing live military drills. Pelosi meeting with the Taiwanese president and other senior officials.

REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Today, world faces a choice between democracy and autocracy. America's determination to preserve democracy here in Taiwan and around the world remains ironclad.

PANNELL: Tensions in the region are now at their highest levels in decades. Dozens of Chinese naval vessels and aircraft have been doing drills in the Taiwan Strait. Precision missiles launched from the mainland. Some passing over Taiwan's capital, Taipei, for the first time ever.

On Friday, China announcing they’re not suspending talks with the U.S. on a number of key issues. With the White House summoning the Chinese ambassador and urging restraint.

The tensions in Taiwan partially overshadowing a CIA drone strike that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan.

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The mission was a success.

PANNELL: Al-Zawahiri was a key figure in the rise of al Qaeda, pivotal in the group’s shift to target the U.S. He was the right-hand man of Osama bin Laden at the time of the 9/11 attacks. Images now emerging of the compound that was struck.

The Taliban confirming the death of the world's most wanted terrorist, who analysts say was crucial in holding this sprawling al Qaeda network together.

President Biden vowing that the country will never become a safe haven for extremists again.

BIDEN: No matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out.

PANNELL: But already there are renewed warnings that al Qaeda may seek retribution and target American citizens abroad.

And this week WNBA star Brittney Griner joining the list of U.S. citizens detained in Russia after she was sentenced to nine years in a prison camp by a Moscow court, found guilty of drug possession and smuggling. Griner was arrested entering the country back in February, just at the start of the war in Ukraine. Caught at the airport with a vape cartridge containing hashish oil, her arrest sparking a wave of condemnation from the United States. Griner saying she didn't intend to break Russian law, pleading with a judge for leniency.

BRITTNEY GRINER, WNBA PLAYER DETAINED IN RUSSIA: I made an honest mistake and I hope that in your ruling that it doesn't end my life here.

PANNELL: But in a highly charged trial, her pleas fell on deaf ears. The judge handing out a sentence only just short of the 10-year maximum. She had one last message before she was led from court.

GRINER: I love my family.

PANNELL: Griner's lawyers saying she will appeal but that could take months. The Kremlin using her case to play hardball in negotiations about potential prisoner swaps. And she's not alone, ex-marine Paul Whelan and teacher Marc Fogel also serving lengthy jail sentences. Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saying he's ready for private diplomacy with Secretary of State Blinken.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks to Ian Pannell for that. We're joined now by former U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson.

Ambassador Richardson, thanks for joining us this morning. I know you've been involved in these discussions around the Brittney Griner detention right now. What exactly have you been doing? What have you learned?

BILL RICHARDSON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.: Well, I don't want to go into everything that I've been doing. I've been talking to the Russians. I talked to the White House. I'm a catalyst. This is going to be government-to-government negotiation. I think the president and his team, they're very focused on this. They've done a good job so far with Trevor Reed, an American marine a couple of months ago coming back on a prisoner exchange.

So I'm a catalyst. I'm not directly doing the talking. But when I can be helpful through my contacts, through my experience, for instance, Foreign Minister Lavrov, he and I were U.N. ambassadors together at the same time.

And I'm pleased that he's pragmatic, that he's sort of in charge and sent a good signal. I think the negotiations are going to be undertaken. And my view is that I'm optimistic. I think she's going to be freed. I think she has the right strategy of contrition, a good legal team.

There's going to be a prisoner swap, though. And I think it will be two for two involving Paul Whelan. We can't forget him. He's an American marine wrongfully detained too.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, you say two for two, but -- you say two for two, but what about the third American Marc Fogel? He's an educator. He's facing a prison sentence right now. His infraction was similar to Brittney Griner's. Shouldn't he be included in this?

RICHARDSON: Well, there's -- my foundation, which doesn't take orders from the government, we're not funded by the government, I don't take any funds from it, we're involved with three other American detainees in Russia, including a POW in Ukraine. So, George, I don't want to get too much into these. But, yes, all of these that are wrongfully detained need to come home. And our objective should be, despite prisoner exchanges that are not popular, to bring American hostages home. Some of these prisoner exchanges are not good. They don't -- the optics are not good. But we have to do it sometimes. And I commend the president for having done this with -- with Trevor Reed.

I wouldn't have gone public as much as they did on the Bout for Griner and Whelan. But it was done. Sometimes when negotiations are not working, you want to throw a little bit of a bomb and I think that's what they did.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Viktor Bout, of course, is that notorious international arms dealer. How do you respond to the argument that prisoner exchanges will encourage America's adversaries to actually detain more Americans on trumped up charges?

RICHARDSON: Well, there's no data that supports that. Look, I just got back from Burma. And I got out an American journalist, Danny Fenster. All they wanted was a photo-op. So data doesn't support that prisoner exchanges are always the case. Yes, they're increasing, especially with countries like Iran, Venezuela, Russia. But as unpleasant as they are, we have to bring American hostages home, especially those wrongfully detained, especially those that have served in our military.

So, look, they're not perfect, but I commend the president for considering it. I commend the president for putting Viktor Bout, notorious arms dealer, a terrible guy, out there, public. I would have done it quietly and I’ve been helping and I’m ready to continue helping. I don't want to get too much into what I’ve been doing, George.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, we all hope -- we all hope this is a success. Ambassador Richardson, thanks very much for your time this morning.

RICHARDSON: And, George, I think the president should run and I'll support him -- President Biden should run. He’s got a good record. I know you didn’t ask --

STEPHANOPOULOS: I didn’t ask the --

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: That's good to hear you say that. Okay, thanks very much. Take care.

(COMMERCIAL BRAK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Political director Rick Klein is ready to go. We’ll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DICK CHENEY, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: There has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump. He tried to steal the last election, using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.

He's a coward. Liz is fearless. She never backs down from a fight. There's nothing more important than she'll ever do to lead the effort to make sure Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office. And she will succeed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Dick Cheney blasting Donald Trump in a campaign ad for his daughter ahead of her primary next week. Cheney is Trump’s biggest target now, and he’s coming from key wins in this week’s primaries.

Political director Rick Klein back with his midterm monitor.

And, Rick, let's start with our new poll with Ipsos. Strong job numbers this week, but President Biden and the Democrats still facing voters who are quite sour on the economy.

RICK KLEIN, ABC NEWS POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Yeah, George, no meaningful approval rating increase for Joe Biden across the board, on a range of issues. He's still stuck in some low numbers.

And get this -- 69 percent of Americans still think the economy is getting worse despite the drop in gas prices, despite those positive economic numbers and we’re seeing that spill over into voter enthusiasm. Republicans more likely to say that they are ready and eager to go vote than Democrats, and those numbers have not changed, George, for months.

But one sign that might -- something that might change going forward in the wake of that big vote in Kansas on Tuesday to preserve abortion rights, we asked people -- are you more likely to support a candidate who wants to keep abortion legal or who supports policies that would limit abortion access? And that is a striking number, 49 percent, that’s almost half of Americans who say that they would consider the issue and they are more likely to vote for a candidate who would keep abortion legal in their state.

That suggests that, look, while the economy is a drag on Democrats, there are other issues that come into view. And if abortion is one of them, Democrats could see a big motivating effort around that.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Kansas aside, Donald Trump had a big night on Tuesday. How does his record look across the primaries?

KLEIN: This was another week with a MAGA sweep. We saw it in Arizona. We saw it in Michigan. He’s got big tests coming up in Wisconsin, as well as with Liz Cheney's race in Wyoming,

And Donald Trump's success really matters the most when it comes to the Senate map. This is what we're looking at. There are ten seats that are likely to determine control of the Senate. Of those 10, eight of them are open on the Republican side, where you have a competitive Republican primary.

And when you look at those eight states, you see that Donald Trump has won, his candidate, in almost every one of them. Blake Masters in Arizona, the latest to join a list that already included Nevada, as well as North Carolina. We had J.D. Vance in Ohio, Dr. Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, Herschel Walker in Georgia.

Most of those candidates like Trump deny the legitimacy of the last election. Many of those candidates have never run for office before.

So, the concern among some Republicans right now, George, is while Trump knows what a Republican primary voter wants, that’s not the same as the general election.

STEPHANOPOULOS: In Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, they're behind right now, his candidates.

KLEIN: That's right, and that's exactly the concern, is that when you see that polling gap begin to open up, how do you overcome that when you got Trump’s people on the ballot?

STEPHANOPOULOS: Meantime, you also saw those who support the idea that Joe Biden did not win the 2020 election basically support Donald Trump's big lie did well in some of these down ballot races as well, including those who are going to administer elections.

KLEIN: Yes. Six states and counting where the Republican nominee for a statewide office that oversees an election denies the legitimacy of the last election. That includes people like a secretary of state candidate in Arizona and in Michigan. Also candidates for governor in Texas and Pennsylvania. Those are two states where the governor appoints the next secretary of state.

And, look, this is some -- this is a big deal, because this could easily be the biggest takeaway from midterm elections, George. You’ve got people who falsely claim that the last election was stolen who could be in a position to oversee the next election.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Yeah, that is ominous.

OK. Rick Klein, thanks very much.

Roundtable is up next. We'll be right back.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Roundtable’s up next.

We’ll be right back.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: With a record turnout, voters in Kansas defeated a ballot initiative to remove the right to choose an abortion from the Kansas constitution. Voters made it clear that politicians should not interfere with the fundamental rights of women.

SEN. ROGER MARSHALL (R-KS): I'm deeply, emotional sorrowful about the loss yesterday. My whole life’s been about protecting the life of moms and babies and – and I think that this was a step away from that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: A stunning result out of Kansas this week, rejecting that attempt to amend the constitution, which does protects abortion rights. One of the things we’re going to talk about on our roundtable.

I'm joined by Chris Christie, Democracy for America's CEO Yvette Simpson, our chief Washington correspondent Jon Karl, and executive editor of the AP, Julie Pace.

And, Chris, let me begin with you. What was your takeaway from Kansas?

CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, I think this is what’s going to happen across the country, George, people, like me, have been saying for decades that the states should make these calls, and the states are now going to make these calls. And I think that's why everybody who says that, well, this means that abortion’s going to banned all over the country, when the Dobbs decision came down, you know, is going to change and vary from state to state to state. And sometimes you’re going to get results that don’t seem consistent with the state’s color, where in this case, Kansas, a very red state, went in that direction.

So, you know, that's why I think a lot of the manufactured hysteria that some aspects of the Democratic Party went in to is undercut by this result in Kansas. People are going to make their own decisions. Legislatures are going to decide. Indiana did something very, very different. This is the way it's going to work across the country.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Manufactured hysteria?

YVETTE SIMPSON, CEO, DEMOCRACY FOR AMERICA: No, no. I don't think so. I mean, I think Kansas is the exact opposite, right? It shows that this was an issue that people agree with and when we get on the ground and we organize voters in a red state across the state, in cities and rural areas and suburbs, people show up. And so unfortunately for Republicans and fortunately for us, if we continue this same momentum, if we make abortion access the issue, we might actually have enough energy to pull it off. I think that's something...

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: I think one of the other things you saw, Julie Pace, is that when you talk about amending a constitution, voters tend to reject radical solutions.

JULIE PACE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ASSOCIATED PRESS: They do. I think that feels so much more permanent for voters. And I think what was notable in Kansas was not just the outcome but it was the turnout numbers, seeing general election turnout numbers in a primary. And I think that's what has Democrats most emboldened right now is that it's that enthusiasm and that energy to come out for these constitutional amendment votes. I think the challenge over the next couple of months for Democrats will be trying to keep up the focus on something like abortion access at the same time that Americans are very much dealing with inflation, very much dealing with a lot of economic realities. And as you saw in some of the numbers that Rick was showing us earlier, that still remains a really powerful an influence...

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, that is going to be one of the big issues. Traditionally abortion has not been a massive voting issue, especially in midterms. I guess the big question, is this year different?

JONATHAN KARL, ABC CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT & ""THIS WEEK"" CO-ANCHOR: And, look, this was an extraordinary event. I mean, this winning in Kansas with a 20-point margin voters rejecting the idea of a complete abortion ban. The question, though, George is, does that enthusiasm extend to the candidate races for the midterms? Because in this case, there was one issue they were voting on, should abortion be outlawed? That one issue, huge turnout. The pro-abortion rights group wins, dominates. But when you're voting for a candidate, you're also voting on other issues. And the issue in poll after poll after poll that we see that is still the number one issue is inflation, gas prices, the economy.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And, Yvette, we just saw in our poll this morning, 69 percent sour on the economy. Joe Biden stuck in the 30s right now.

SIMPSON: Yes. I think the reality is we continue to debate about whether there's inflation, whether we're in a recession, and if you just ask people, they're struggling. And I don't know if the IRA is going to get there. I mean, we know that child...

STEPHANOPOULOS: The bill they're working on.

SIMPSON: The bill that just passed the Senate yesterday. People are still suffering. Child care was not in there. Paid leave was not in there. We still have issues with wages. People are still feeling the pain. And if the issue at the ballot box is, do feel like we're in a recession? We're going to lose on that. Do you feel like there's inflation? We're going to lose on that. We need to make sure we're showing the American people that we're doing everything we can to make them secure. And a small win on gas prices and a bill on climate right now is not going to get us all the way there.

(CROSSTALK)

CHRISTIE: Yes, George, you know, when you're arguing with people in a 9 percent inflation world that they shouldn't be feeling pain, that the economy is actually good, that's just a losing argument and they know it. The American people feel it. They know it. And in the end what we see...

STEPHANOPOULOS: But it is a tale of two economies. You're right, the inflation rate is incredibly high, but look at those jobs numbers on Friday.

CHRISTIE: Well, but people can't keep up with the costs of living their lives. So they say OK, great, I've got a job, that's a good thing. But to get to that job, I've got to fill my car with gas, and it costs that much more. Then when I'm on my way home from work, I've got to go to the supermarket and I get absolutely tanked there from a dollar perspective. And then I look at what's going on with my kids, if I'm sending them to school, are they going to college? All those expenses are going way, way up. And people say, yes, I have a job, but my life is worse now than it was two years ago. And we know from Ronald Reagan that that's an incredibly powerful question. Am I better off now than I was two years ago? And the American people don't feel it. And that's why Joe Biden is in the 30s.

STEPHANOPOULOS: All that despite the fact, Julie Pace that, as Chris Coons sort of outlined, the president has had a pretty remarkable both legislative and executive action winning streak over the last several weeks.

PACE: It has been a total shift in momentum for this White House, which has had a pretty rough year on a lot of fronts. And now suddenly you see this breakthrough on Capitol Hill in the Senate with Joe Manchin and Sinema jumping in here. You see the White House taking out -- or the U.S. taking out a terror leader in Afghanistan. And suddenly it feels like Joe Biden has got a bit of momentum.

But I do think to Chris's point, you know, it is really hard to convince people to feel something different than what they are experiencing. It is really hard to put out jobs statistics. It is really hard to point to even a big win on terrorism and make people feel differently than what they experience when they do go to the grocery store. And the White House knows that. They're going to try to do everything they can to harness this momentum, but they know they are fighting against some pretty strong headwinds still.

KARL: Which is why, if you look at our new poll, I mean, he's getting credit for almost nothing. He's on a roll, I mean, there's no question that Joe Biden is on a roll legislatively, on the national security front, but he's getting no credit for it.

And look, inflation is still a factor. Gas prices are actually coming down, and have been coming down for almost two months. The unemployment numbers are remarkable. Not only the unemployment numbers, but wage growth continues to rise. It’s just not keeping pace --

(CROSSTALK)

CHRISTIE: It's an inside Washington role, George.

(CROSSTALK)

CHRISTIE: It’s an inside Washington role. Like, they won on the Inflation Reduction Act, which is a ridiculous name, as you pointed out in the interview, but they won on that. They got Democrats to actually vote for a Democrat bill. What are we going to do? Drop the confetti at the White House? I mean, this is ridiculous. It’s an inside Washington role.

The people in the rest of the country are saying, wait a second, I’m still paying much more for gas than I should, I'm still paying much more to cool my house, I can’t keep groceries on the table, and I'm worried about the future.

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: -- get to the midterms.

Yvette, one of the things the Democrats are counting on, if you just look to Joe Biden's approval rating and views on the economy looking like a bloodbath for Democrats but right now, Dr. Oz is behind in Pennsylvania. Mark Kelly, a Democrat, is ahead in Arizona. J.D. Vance is fighting in Ohio. It does look like the Democrats are still in the game, at least in the Senate.

SIMPSON: The Republicans are giving us gifts in the form of election deniers and people with rap sheets a mile long. I mean, you know, you’ve got Dr. Oz, you’ve got Herschel Walker. You’ve got J.D. Vance. These folks who do not relate to the people in their states, cannot connect with anybody and people don't have faith in them.

And I think we’ve been very fortunate on the other side. We’ve got some strong candidates who are going to take them on in Raphael Warnock and John Fetterman and others. So I think we have to make that that is the story. Not necessarily about what people are feeling but the alternative is a Republican Party that doesn't believe in elections, that stormed the Capitol on January 6th, these folks who were abusers and this issue with Marjorie Taylor Greene praying with a guy in a cell. I mean, the Republican Party is a wacko party. The alternative is that. You got to go with the Democrats in November.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Jon Karl, we just heard Mike Rounds say he sure doesn't want Donald Trump on the ballot in 2022.

KARL: I mean, look, almost nobody in a Republican leadership wants Donald Trump to announce he’s running before the midterms. Because Donald Trump is on a roll, speaking of rolls, he is dominating these parties. You have candidates winning in state after state who would have had no chance without a Donald Trump endorsement and they're winning the Republican primaries.

But here’s the thing, the more Trump wins the more Republicans are poised to lose because he is helping nominate candidates who are likely to lose -- coming into these races as underdogs, likely to lose races that Republicans should win. So if Republicans don't win the Senate, there’s going to be one reason and one reason only, and it's Donald Trump. He has chased candidates out of races that would have won or had a very good chance of winning in the fall and he has nominated -- helped nominate candidates who are likely to lose.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Julie Pace, little sign that Donald Trump cares about that.

PACE: Well, I was just going to say, after Jon’s point there, I think that is all likely true, I just don't think Trump cares, right? And I don't think he's going to look at these midterms as an indication of whether he should move forward or not with running for the presidency or whether his -- whether he could win or not.

I think having him on the ballot still remains. I think this is a very unique situation. I think there are a lot of points of evidence that he would go into this presidential race in 2024 weaker than certainly he did I think in his other races. But again, I just don’t think he is bringing that (ph).

STEPHANOPOULOS: Chris Christie, as you know, it’s perilous to predict what Donald Trump will do and --

CHRISTIE: You think?

STEPHANOPOULOS: Can anyone convince him not to announce before 2022 and are you really convinced he's going to run?

CHRISTIE: Well, let’s say a few things first. I've been sitting here for four-and-a-half years now saying that the most important thing in the election is a candidate. More than atmosphere, more than money, candidates matter. And we’re going to find that out in the fall.

I think Yvette laid that out very clearly. You’re going to find out how these candidates are going to perform. Right now, they're losing in these states. It’s up to them. They've got wind at their back as Republicans, they should win, so they have to perform.

Am I convinced Donald Trump’s going to run for president? I am not convinced. I believe it's 50/50 shot right now whether he runs or he doesn’t. And I think, Julie, when you say he doesn't care about whether or not they can win in November, he doesn't care about that right now because right now all he cares about is winning the primaries to show that he's still strong inside the party.

But let me tell you something, if they’re showing -- if Dr. Oz is losing by whatever it is now, 11 points I think it said, if Dr. Oz is losing by 11 in October, Donald Trump is going to act like he never met him, let alone endorse him.

(CROSSTALK)

KARL: -- going to react if they fail to win the Senate in a year where it was all set up --

CHRISTIE: But, Jon, you know --

KARL: -- how huge Republicans -- how are Republicans --

CHRISTIE: You know how they're going to react --

PACE: But the question is whether Trump --

CHRISTIE: They’re -- how they’re going to get --

PACE: takes that as a referendum on him.

CHRISTIE: Of course he won’t.

PACE: And whether he acts off that.

(CROSSTALK)

CHRISTIE: Julie, of course he won't. But he won't outwardly take it as a referendum on him, but he will know internally that what people are going to be able to say about him and Republicans are going to be able to say about him, and Republicans are going to be able to say about him is -- loser. You led us down this path and we lost.

And you can count on the fact that Mitch McConnell is going to be saying that and a whole bunch of other people who are going to be saying it.

Here’s the difference, real quickly, between now and 2015 -- in 2015, no one took Donald Trump seriously.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.

CHRISTIE: In 2015, they thought it was kind of entertaining, and they thought, well, we don’t know if he’s really serious about running or not. So, we had a certain atmosphere around him both from other Republican officeholders and the media.

None of that will exist eight years later in 2023 for him and he's going to factor that into whatever he decides to do, because he's not dumb.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Meantime, Yvette, Joe Biden has to factor the grumblings of a lot of Democrats right now. Bill Richardson aside --

(LAUGHTER)

SIMPSON: Thanks, Bill.

STEPHANOPOULOS: -- lot of Democrats, whether he should be running again, lot of Democrats dodging the question right now.

What should he do?

SIMPSON: I think that he should not run. I mean, I -- you know, his numbers are really low, overwhelmingly, the poll came out that Democrats don't want him to run. I mean, when folks rallied around him to be the president, there was the expectation that he would not run again, that he would actually empower someone to run. Who that person is going to be, I don't know.

But his energy, the fact that he’s not been able to --

STEPHANOPOULOS: You don't say Kamala Harris is the heir apparent?

SIMPSON: She should be. I don’t know that he’s positioned to do that. She should have been positioned powerfully and able to actually be a person that could be lead, and she’s been in the back.

And I think that she should be empowered to be the leader. She’s powerful. She’s young. She’s able to get the energy, but we have not seen her strong and I don't know why the Biden administration didn't position her that way. It has to be her, because there would be an outrage to skip over the vice president, especially the first African-American and Asian female vice president.

But they've got to do a lot of work to get her in the seat so that we can see her powerful, and that should be the work that we should be doing right now. Not holding together with patches of Biden who is definitely bad or has not kept the promises that he made in bipartisanship and getting the kind of work that he said he was going to do --

STEPHANOPOULOS: I don’t know if you can say he hasn’t kept the promises. He's had a 50/50 Senate. He’s had a long winning streak.

But there’s no question, Jon Karl, that this talk -- this entire discussion drives the White House crazy.

KARL: Oh, absolutely. And the message from the White House is Joe Biden is running for re-election, period. Barring some, you know, health scare, he is running.

But you talk to Democrats privately, key Democrats on Capitol Hill, leaders in the party and there is just trepidation about this. There is a sense that among many of them, that he shouldn't run. And also, a sense that if he doesn't run, that the primary is wide open and it's not just Kamala Harris' to take, and it could be a very messy Democratic primary.

SIMPSON: Which we don't need.

CHRISTIE: George, when she -- when she ran for president, it was a roundly unimpressive campaign, at least with the voters. So candidates matter. I go back to theme, candidates matter. She's got to earn it.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And we will be watching. Thank you all very much. Terrific discussion.

NICOLE MANN, NASA CREW-5 COMMANDER: We have an incredible crew to go up to the International Space Station. From an operational perspective, to be honest, it really doesn't matter if you're, you know, a woman or a man or what country you're from or your gender or your race, we're coming together as a human race and our mission onboard the international space station of developing this technology and research to benefit all of humankind is really what brings us together.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: NASA is preparing to launch a crew to the International Space Station next month, including a Russian cosmonaut. But as tensions escalate between the U.S. and Russia, the space agency is now caught in crosshairs after the Russians announced they would quit the space station.

Transportation correspondent Gio Benitez reports on the fallout.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

GIO BENITEZ, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Hundreds of miles above earth orbits the International Space Station, born from a quarter century partnership between the U.S. and Russian space programs. And as early as next month, NASA, in collaboration with the Japanese and Russian space agencies, will launch Crew-5 to the ISS, a mission that may show the enduring importance of U.S. and Russia space relation.

NICOLE MANN, NASA CREW-5 COMMANDER: The crew of the International Space Station has a unique responsibility to really come together, collaborate and work as a team no matter where you come from or what’s going on in the world.

BENITEZ: Amid crippling sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, Russia announcing it was now exiting the International Space Station in 2024. NASA administrator Bill Nelson hopeful that the U.S. can get Russia to stay on.

BILL NELSON, NASA ADMINISTRATOR: We intend to fly the Space Station until we have a commercial space station in 2030. And we think the Russians will continue to operate it with us.

BENITEZ: Despite decades of teamwork, U.S. and Russian space relations have a complicated history.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today, a new moon is in the sky, a 23 inch metal sphere placed in orbit by a Russian rocket.

BENITEZ: The then Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik sparking the space race in 1957. But the U.S. quickly soared to new heights, making it to the moon first.

NEIL ARMSTRONG, ASTRONAUT: It’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

BENITEZ: Then 1975 ushered in a new frontier for the nations, establishing the partnership that built the International Space Station.

NELSON: Despite our difficulties, our relationship is very steady, very professional, very friendly when it comes to the civilians space program.

BENITEZ: The ISS becoming a beacon of peace and cooperation.

NELSON: We built the Space Station together and it takes both Russia and America to operate that station.

BENITEZ: That cooperation now being tested. In March, then head of the Russian space agency, Dmitry Rogozin, posted this video threatening to abandon American astronaut Mark Vande Hei, who was set to return home on a Russian ship. But Russia is also one of only two countries, the other, China, that haven't signed on to the Artemis Accords, a U.S.-led agreement on space exploration and returning humans to the moon. The first unproved test flight for the Artemis program is scheduled for later this month.

NELSON: NASA is one of the greatest tools of soft power for the United States government.

BENITEZ: Despite tensions, next month's NASA Crew-5 mission could show that cooperation is still possible. One crew member is a Russian cosmonaut.

JOSH CASSADA, NASA CREW-5 PILOT: I honestly believe that every day human space flight proves that if we all work together, there's literally – and literally within the bounds of physics, there’s nothing we can't accomplish.

BENITEZ: For THIS WEEK, I'm Gio Benitez, ABC News.

With the midterm elections three months away, Americans maintain a sour view on the state of the economy and are pessimistic about its future course, with President Joe Biden’s approval rating across a range of issue areas continuing to suffer, according to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll.

More than two-thirds (69%) of Americans think the nation’s economy is getting worse -- the highest that measure has reached since 2008, when it was 82% in an ABC News/Washington Post poll. Currently, only 12% think the economy is getting better and 18% think it is essentially staying the same.

Americans' views of Biden's handling of the economic recovery remain overwhelmingly negative -- and are virtually unchanged from the same poll in early June, with only 37% of Americans approving of the job the president is doing and 62% disapproving in the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll, which was conducted using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel.

The president’s rating on inflation is even worse, with 29% of Americans saying they approve, while 69% disapprove. This number is also unchanged since June.

The only area where Biden sees some improvement in this poll is on his handling of gas prices. Just over one in three Americans (34%) approve of the president's handling of gas prices -- up seven points since June.

This comes as the country has seen the average cost for a gallon of gas come down -- price drops celebrated by the White House.

The low confidence in Biden’s handling of the economy and inflation comes on the heels of Friday’s jobs report, which showed that 528,000 jobs were added in July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Americans also saw the unemployment rate go down to 3.5%.

In a statement released Friday, Biden touted the July jobs report, saying that it shows that his administration is “making significant progress for working families.""

When asked how enthusiastic they were about voting in November, the poll found that 75% of Republicans are either very or somewhat enthusiastic about voting, compared to 68% of Democrats and 49% of independents. In ABC News/Ipsos polls conducted in April and June this year, Republicans were more likely to report that they were very enthusiastic about voting than Democrats. That gap has narrowed to five points in this August poll.

There are other glimmers of hope for the Democrats in the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll when it comes to the potential impact abortion could have on how voters cast their ballots this November.

The poll asked voters which candidate they would support if one favored keeping abortion legal and available and the other candidate supported limiting abortion except to protect the mother’s life. About half of Americans (49%) would be more likely to support the candidate who would keep access to abortion legal compared to the 27% of Americans who would be more likely to support the candidate who favors limiting abortion. Meanwhile, 22% of Americans say that abortion would not have an impact on how they would vote.

This comes after voters in the deep red state of Kansas voted to preserve the right to an abortion in the state’s constitution, shocking the country in the first state-level test since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

In a statement from Biden on the defeat of Kansas’s abortion amendment, he called on Congress to “listen to the will of the American people and restore the protections of Roe as federal law.”

This ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted using Ipsos Public Affairs‘ KnowledgePanel® August 5-6, 2022, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 665 adults.

Senate Democrats passed their first procedural vote on the Inflation Reduction Act on Saturday.

The motion to proceed on the $739 billion climate, tax and health care bill passed in a 51 to 50 vote. Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote.

Now, Republicans and Democrats have up to 10 hours each to debate the spending bill, though it's not yet clear how much of the allotted debate time each side will use. After that, they'll move ahead to the consideration of amendments in a marathon session dubbed the ""vote-a-rama.""

Senators can offer an unlimited amount of amendments, and Republicans have already pledged to bring up several on issues like immigration, the border, energy and crime.

""What will vote-a-rama be like? It'll be like hell,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters on Friday.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Saturday the amendments won't discourage Democrats.

""These efforts will not deter us,"" he said during remarks on the Senate floor. ""No matter how long it takes, the Senate is going to stay in session to finish this bill.""

""We are not leaving until the job is done,"" he added.

Democrats are fast-tracking the legislation through a process known as reconciliation, which allows them to pass the bill through a simple majority vote. All 50 members of their caucus need to back the bill in order for it to pass, with Vice President Harris acting as a tiebreaker.

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., cleared the way for the Inflation Reduction Act to move forward when she announced her support on Thursday after tax provisions targeting wealthy hedge fund managers and private equity executives she opposed were removed from the bill.

Sinema, who was the last Democratic holdout, said she'd sign on ""subject to the parliamentarian's review.""

On Saturday, the parliamentarian gave the green light to most of the drug pricing provisions in the bill, except for a provision that aimed to penalize drug companies that raise the prices of some prescription drugs faster than inflation for patients with private insurance.

""Democrats have received extremely good news: for the first time, Medicare will finally be allowed to negotiate prescription drug prices, seniors will have free vaccines and their costs capped, and much more. This is a major victory for the American people,"" Schumer said.

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the parliamentarian also signed off on his committee's clean energy tax package, which includes consumer credits for Americans to make energy efficiency improvements to their homes and for those who purchase electric vehicles.

President Joe Biden celebrated the movement on the bill, which encompasses key portions of his agenda. It's a ""game changer for working families and our economy,"" he said on Friday.

The White House said Saturday it was ""heartened to see the Senate make progress"" on the Inflation Reduction Act.

Republicans are expected to be unanimous in their opposition to the Inflation Reduction Act, and have heavily criticized Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., for striking up the deal with Schumer.

On the floor on Saturday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., slammed the bill's climate provisions and drug pricing plans.

""American families don't want Democrats policing what kinds of clothes and clothes driers they can put in their homes. What they want is for Democrats to start actually policing our city streets,"" said McConnell.

The U.S. Secret Service has given the House Jan. 6 committee a listing of agency-issued cell phone numbers belonging to agents based in Washington, D.C., for the period the panel is investigating, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The move is an unusual step amid heightened scrutiny of the agency's cooperation with the congressional panel investigating last year's insurrection and the role then-President Donald Trump played in it.

The committee can now determine which agents' call records they may want to review and, if they decide to do so, could either request them directly or conceivably issue subpoenas to their cell phone providers, an official familiar with the situation explained.

At the same time, the inspector general responsible for the Secret Service has obtained a listing of personal cell phones as part of its own investigation connected to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.

The Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agency, have faced criticism in recent weeks for wiping text messages belonging to agents on and around Jan. 6, 2021. Congressional Democrats have accused the Homeland Security inspector general of abandoning efforts to collect text and phone records from that day.

Seeking and obtaining information from personal devices from federal workers is a ""highly unusual"" step, according to ABC News contributor Don Mihalek, a retired senior Secret Service agent, and could reflect a renewed effort by the agency to further demonstrate its cooperation with congressional investigators.

The Secret Service has faced serious criticism in recent weeks as committee testimony focused on Trump's conduct on Jan. 6, 2021, and what agents assigned to the White House did and saw that day.

At the same time, Mihalek said, the agency's decision to hand personal device information over to the committee could present thorny legal challenges.

A spokesperson for the Secret Service recently acknowledged that some phone data from January 2021 was lost as the result of a pre-planned data transfer, noting that the transfer was underway when the inspector general's office made the request in February 2021.

ABC News reported Thursday that DHS is reviewing its electronic retention policies and would halt wiping political appointees' phones until the review is complete.

Biden first tested positive for the virus on July 21, experiencing a slight fever, cough and sore throat among other mild symptoms. He isolated at the White House residence and completed a five-day course of Paxlovid, an antiviral treatment for those with mild to moderate symptoms who are considered a high risk for severe illness, before testing negative.

After emerging from isolation, he hailed the available COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.

""We've got through COVID with no fear -- I got through it with no fear. A very mild discomfort because of these essential, lifesaving tools,"" he said in a Rose Garden speech. ""And guess what? I want to remind everybody: They are free. They are convenient. And they are safe, and they work.""

While uncommon, some patients who take Paxlovid can test positive again after finishing the treatment course but doctors emphasize that doesn't mean the drug isn't effective. High-risk patients who take the antiviral treatment still have a dramatically lower risk of being hospitalized due to the virus.

Biden said he was feeling well and made several virtual appearances during his second infection, addressing the nation from the Blue Room balcony about the killing of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri on Monday and touting a strong jobs report and movement on his agenda in the Senate on Friday.

Biden and first lady Jill Biden have plans to travel to Kentucky on Monday, the White House previously announced, in what would be his first trip since his diagnosis.

The Senate parliamentarian has signed off on key climate and health care provisions in the Democrats' major spending bill.

The rulings from Elizabeth MacDonough, the chamber's non-partisan rule keeper, come before an expected vote Saturday afternoon to begin debate on the $739 billion climate, health care and tax package titled the ""Inflation Reduction Act.""

Democrats are using a fast-track process known as reconciliation to pass the bill through a simple majority vote. The Senate parliamentarian is responsible for issuing opinions on whether provisions meet conditions of the budget reconciliation rules.

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the Senate Finance Committee's clean energy tax package -- a major portion of the bill -- adhered to the chamber rules.

The Inflation Reduction Act sets out $369 billion for climate, much of which would go toward tax credits to prop up clean energy technologies. Consumer tax credits are included for Americans to make ""home energy efficiency improvements"" and for those who purchase electric vehicles.

It also provides a tax credit to clean energy developers who pay their workers the prevailing wage.

""I'm especially pleased that our prevailing wage provisions were approved,"" Wyden said in a statement. ""These provisions guarantee wage rates for clean energy projects. Clean energy jobs will be good-paying jobs.""

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also announced Saturday that the parliamentarian signed off on most of the drug pricing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act except for one prescription cost-reducing program Democrats wanted to include.

""Democrats have received extremely good news: for the first time, Medicare will finally be allowed to negotiate prescription drug prices, seniors will have free vaccines and their costs capped, and much more. This is a major victory for the American people,"" Schumer said in a statement.

The legislation will allow the federal health secretary to directly negotiate the prices of certain expensive drugs for Medicare starting in 2026. It would also cap out-of-pocket costs for those who use Medicare drug plans at $2,000.

Democrats wanted to penalize drug companies for raising prices of some prescription drugs faster than inflation, in an effort to keep costs down. But, according to a source familiar, the parliamentarian ruled that these penalties cannot be applied on individuals with private health insurance. They'll stay in affect for Medicare.

""While there was one unfortunate ruling in that the inflation rebate is more limited in scope, the overall program remains intact and we are one step closer to finally taking on Big Pharma and lowering Rx drug prices for millions of Americans,"" Schumer said.

Schumer said earlier this week that the first vote on the spending bill is expected Saturday afternoon.

The motion to proceed, if passed, would begin debate on the bill and give lawmakers the opportunity to vote on amendments in what's been dubbed ""vote-a-rama.""

Republicans have pledged to bring up amendments on issues related to immigration, crime and energy. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters on Friday that the voting session will be ""hell.""

President Joe Biden on Friday praised the movement on the bill, stating Democrats were ""on the cusp"" of passing what he said was the ""most important step"" to combating inflation.

""In short, this bill is a game changer for working families and our economy,"" he said. ""I look forward to the Senate taking up this legislation and passing it as soon as possible."""

Sinema sought changes to the Inflation Reduction Act specifically for the removal of the ""carried interest"" loophole provision.
In her statement Thursday evening, Sinema left the door open to future discussions on modifying the carried interest tax.","With the Senate Democrats' last remaining holdout -- Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema -- tentatively signing onto a $739 billion modified reconciliation deal, her party leaders are looking forward to a first procedural vote on their historic tax, climate and drug-pricing bill as early as Saturday.

The Senate is expected to eventually pass The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 through using a fast-track budget process known as reconciliation as early as this weekend. If all Democrats stick together, they'll be able to clear the hefty legislative package by their razor-thin majority and avoid a Republican threat of a filibuster.

In a surprise move in late July, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin announced he had brokered a deal on a revised version of a Democrat-only spending bill with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer after it seemed the door was closed on negotiations.

After reviewing the legislation, Sinema on Thursday evening offered her essential but still conditional support for the bill. Her support was conditioned upon Democrats stripping from the bill a tax break favoring wealthy hedge-fund managers called the ""carried interest loophole,"" while adding instead a new excise tax on stock buybacks.

The current proposed text aims to increase job creation, raise taxes on large corporations and the mega-wealthy, allows the government to negotiate prices of prescription drugs to lower costs, expands the Affordable Care Act health care program and invests in addressing climate change with measure such as extending tax credits for clean energy initiatives.

Together, the climate and ACA provisions would cost the government roughly $433 billion, and Democrats plan to put at least $300 billion of that toward deficit reduction. The tax provisions, prescription drug-pricing reform and increased IRS tax enforcement would raise the estimated revenue the bill would produce to $739 billion.

Republicans have bashed the proposal, saying that any tax increases or spending package while the nation is falling into an economic recession is irresponsible.

""This is not about inflation reduction, this is all about Democrats spending on things they want to spend money on. I'm not going to support it. I don't think any Republicans are going to support it. Why is that? Well, it's another taxing and spending bill,"" said Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah in response to the bill.

Tax analysts argue that the legislation would help American families who make less than $400,000. Democrats say it would reduce inflation at least in part by lowering the deficit, a key priority for Manchin.

The bill would reduce federal budget deficits by $102 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

""The legislation would either reduce or have no effect on the taxes due or paid by any family with income less than $400,000 and is fully consistent with the President's pledge. In fact, the clean energy tax credits and the expanded premium tax credit will cut taxes for millions of Americans,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrote in a letter to congressional leadership.

Sinema said she is still waiting to see the results of a scrub by the Senate's non-partisan rule keeper before signing off, but if Schumer can keep his caucus together and pass this bill, it will be a big win for democratic leaders ahead of a hotly-contested upcoming midterm cycle.

""We have agreed to remove the carried interest tax provision, protect advanced manufacturing, and boost our clean energy economy in the Senate's budget reconciliation legislation,"" the Arizona senator said in a statement. ""Subject to the Parliamentarian's review, I'll move forward.""

Details of the reconciliation bill were highlighted further Thursday as lawmakers continued to comb through the 700-plus pages of legislation ahead of this weekend's votes. Once the Senate votes to begin debate on the bill, lawmakers will have the opportunity to offer an unlimited number of amendments, a cumbersome and time-consuming process.

Here's what's in the bill from the Democrats' top-line priorities: the economy, the environment and health care.

Economy

The new proposal will invest $300 billion in ""deficit reduction,"" backers say, by making the ""biggest corporations and ultra-wealthy pay their fair share,"" and by providing funds to enhance IRS tax enforcement.

But some of Democrats' most ambitious efforts to tax the ultra wealthy were sidelined by Sinema's insistence that so-called ""carried interest"" tax breaks for wealthy hedge fund managers and private equity executives be retained.

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema arrives at the Capitol for a vote, Aug. 3, 2022. Drew Angerer/Getty Images

The original bill aimed to close this carried interest loophole by extending the holding period and therefore forcing investors to hold onto assets for longer -- a move Wall Street has adamantly fought.

Sinema sought changes to the Inflation Reduction Act specifically for the removal of the ""carried interest"" loophole provision.

""Sen. Sinema said she would not vote for the bill, not even move to proceed, unless we took it out. So we had no choice,"" Schumer said during a press conference on Friday.

In her statement Thursday evening, Sinema left the door open to future discussions on modifying the carried interest tax.

""Following this effort, I look forward to working with Senator [Mark] Warner to enact carried interest tax reforms, protecting investments in America's economy and encouraging continued growth while closing the most egregious loopholes that some abuse to avoid paying taxes,"" she said in a statement Thursday night.

Changes to secure Sinema's backing also included the lessening of a proposed 15% corporate minimum tax by preserving the ability of manufacturers to quickly deduct capital purchases. Proposed changes to depreciation policies had some Republicans concerned that the IRA would disproportionately hit manufactures.

""We remain skeptical and will be reviewing the revised legislation carefully,"" National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons said in a statement. ""We cannot afford to undermine manufacturing competitiveness.""

The proposed corporate minimum tax still apply only to large corporations.

But while Democrats took a loss in revenue to meet Sinema's demands, they made up for it with the addition of a provision aimed at investors -- a new 1% excise tax on stock buybacks that would make companies pay on the amount of stock that they repurchase.

Schumer has said that this excise tax would ensure that the package still reduces the federal deficit by as much as $300 billion, the same amount Democrats aimed for in the original deal and a key priority for Manchin.

""We're adding in an excise tax on stock buy backs that will bring in $74 billion,"" Schumer said.

Chuck Marr, the Vice President of Federal Tax Policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in a Twitter thread called the tax an ""excellent policy,"" designed to correct tax policy inefficiency and ""raises $125 billion over ten years.""

Climate

Most of the $369 billion the Inflation Reduction Act would spend on climate would go to renewable energy tax credits that would prop up clean energy technology such as carbon capture, hydrogen, renewables and energy storage. The climate provisions would also provide consumer tax credits for ""home energy efficiency improvements"" and for the purchase of clean vehicles.

Backers say the package would cut about 40% of the country's carbon emissions by 2030.

The bill includes a methane emissions reduction program, an array of reforms that would have a dramatic impact on both the onshore and offshore federal oil and gas royalty rates and undo a 10-year moratorium on offshore wind leasing established by former President Donald Trump, among other provisions.

Democrats are also excited about the bill's hefty funding initiative -- $60 billion overall -- for environmental justice projects.

Sinema sought a $5 billion boost to the bill's spending on drought resiliency funding in addition to the $575 million already written in the bill that would go to the Bureau of Reclamation for drought response and preparedness and $13 million for drought relief for tribes.

On Friday, Sinema's Arizona colleague Mark Kelly announced a deal to include $4 billion in resources to combat draught in the western U.S. in the bill.

Health care, prescription drug prices

Aside from climate spending, the reconciliation bill also would allocate $64 billion to extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies by three years, through 2025.

It also aims to chip away at a long-held Democratic goal of lowering prescription drug prices for seniors by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices directly.

""The new negotiation policy will ensure that patients with Medicare get the best deal possible on high-priced drugs and pay cost-sharing for those drugs based on the Medicare negotiated price,"" according to the bill's summary.

The bill would also cap out-of-pocket costs at $2,000 for those who use Medicare drug plans, with the option to break that amount into affordable monthly payments. Currently, no cap exists.

It would also impose penalties on drug companies if they increase their prices faster than inflation, which would incentivize them to keep prices down and expand premium and co-pay assistance on prescription drugs for low-income individuals.

""While we're not there yet, we're on the cusp of passing the most important step we can pass to take -- help Congress to help us lower inflation, the Inflation Reduction Act,"" Biden said in remarks at the White House on Friday, touting healthcare wins for Democrats, among the other climate and tax victories."

Fallout continued Friday from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan as China announced it is canceling dialogue with the United States on military talks and climate change.

The Chinese foreign ministry said Friday that working meetings with the U.S. Department of Defense and China-U.S. Maritime Military Security Consultation Mechanism have been canceled as a result of Pelosi's visit.

The ministry said it will also no longer be cooperating with the U.S. on climate change talks, drug control, repatriation of illegal immigrants, criminal investigations and combating transnational crimes.

These were seen as the remaining guardrails to a fraught U.S.-China relationship, but Beijing has long said that the only guardrail that matters is the ""One China"" principle -- that the U.S. recognizes the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China but only acknowledges the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of China.

The action raises questions on the potential impact for global climate benchmarks, as China and the U.S. are the world's top climate polluters. Just last year, the U.S. and China issued a joint pledge to take ""enhanced climate actions"" to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement of limiting warming to below 2 degrees Celsius.

The White House ""summoned"" China's ambassador Qin Gang over China's provocative actions overnight, spokesperson John Kirby said in a statement, and made it clear that the actions are ""of concern to Taiwan, to us, and to our partners around the world.""

Kirby also reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the One China policy, as has Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

Later Friday, the White House spokesman specifically addressed China's halting of climate talks, calling the decision ""fundamentally irresponsible.""

""China's not just punishing the United States with this, with these actions but they're actually punishing the whole world,"" he said. ""The world's largest emitter now is refusing to engage on critical steps necessary to stand up to combat the climate crisis, which actually impacts our partners, from rising sea levels in the Pacific Islands to fires across Europe.""

Kirby also downplayed China’s decision to break off military engagements, saying Beijing ""regularly goes after these sorts of engagements to signal their displeasure with the United States.""

Pelosi and members of a congressional delegation arrived in Taiwan on Tuesday despite warnings not to from mainland China. Pelosi, the highest-ranking American official to visit Taiwan in decades, said the trip -- which also includes stops in Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia -- is about ""advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region.""

Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks at a news conference with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen at the presidential office in Taipei, Taiwan Aug. 3, 2022. Taiwan Presidential Office via Reuters

In response, China has also ramped up military drills and imposed new trade restrictions on Taiwan.

Kirby confirmed on Thursday that China launched an estimated 11 ballistic missiles towards Taiwan, impacting areas to the northeast, the east and southeast of the island.

""We condemn these actions, which are irresponsible and at odds with our long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and in the region,"" Kirby said.

The U.S. expects these actions to continue over the coming days, Kirby said, noting the U.S. is ""prepared"" for what Beijing decides to do.

The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense released new numbers on Friday stating China's deployed 68 fighter jets, 13 warships to the areas and waters around Taiwan. Taiwanese President President Tsai Ing-Wen said the nation remains on high alert.

Kirby said Thursday The USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier and its strike group would remain in the ""general area to monitor the situation"" and would actually ""conduct standard air and maritime transits through the Taiwan Strait in the next few weeks.""

Blinken on Friday called China's response a ""serious overreaction.""

""The fact is, the speaker's visit was peaceful,"" the secretary of state said in between meetings at the ongoing Association of Southeast Asian Nations conference in Cambodia. ""There is no justification to this extreme, disproportionate and escalatory military response.""

Pelosi herself commented on China's reaction to the trip during a press conference Friday alongside the rest of the congressional delegation, stating Beijing was ""probably using our visit as an excuse"" for their missile strikes.

""Our friendship with Taiwan is a strong one,"" she said. ""It is bipartisan in the House and the Senate, overwhelming support for peace and the status quo in Taiwan.""

Republicans in Congress this week have applauded Pelosi's trip, with more than half the GOP caucus in the Senate signing onto a statement backing her decision to go to Taiwan.

Pelosi has also been sanctioned by China, which means that neither she nor her family will be able to visit Mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau.

When asked Friday if Pelosi bore any blame for the rupture in U.S.-China relations, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Pelosi had ""the right"" to go Taiwan.

""There was no reason to have this escalation that we're seeing from China,"" Jean-Pierre said.

In marking a week of political wins, Biden also took a victory lap on lower gas prices, as costs at the pump have declined for 50 straight days.

""Now, I know people will hear today's extraordinary jobs report and say they don't see it, they don't feel it in their own lives,"" he conceded. ""I know how hard it is.

Kari Lake, Republican candidate for Arizona governor, smiles at supporters as she arrives to speak at a post-election news conference in Phoenix, Ariz., Aug. 3, 2022.
Former President Donald Trump speaks during a rally ahead of Arizona primary elections, in Prescott Valley, Ariz., July 22, 2022.
""I have spent my life supporting Republican candidates and causes and it is my hope that our Republican nominees are successful in November.""
While Trump's endorsed candidates are dominating the Arizona primary races, it was unclear if the MAGA agenda would show the same success in November.","Mirroring Trump, she claimed victory while the race was still too close to call.

ABC News can report that Kari Lake, a former longtime news anchor in Phoenix who left her career in media last year and received former President Donald Trump's backing, is projected to win the Republican primary in Arizona's race for governor, after suggesting foul play in an election she already claimed victory in.

""Though the results took longer than they should have, Arizonans who have been forgotten by the establishment just delivered a political earthquake,"" Lake said in a statement after her win was officially projected. ""This is more than an election -- it is a beautiful movement by so many people across our beautiful state to finally put Arizona First.""

Lake defeats Karrin Taylor Robson, a wealthy real estate developer and former member of the Arizona Board of Regents, who was backed by Trump's, now estranged, Vice President Mike Pence and Arizona's current term-limited Gov. Doug Ducey. Trump and Pence traveled to Arizona on the same day last month to stump for the competing candidates, with Pence warning against ""those who want to make this election about the past.""

Taylor Robson spent more than $15 million of her own money on the race, but it was Lake's ""ultra-MAGA"" and ""America First"" stance, coupled with her repetition of Trump's ""Big Lie,"" that ultimately prevailed, after a campaign season filled with attack ads from all angles, which Democratic nominee for governor Katie Hobbs described as a ""primary race to the bottom.""

Hobbs released a statement following the projection calling Lake ""dangerous for Arizona"" and calling the November general election ""a choice between sanity and chaos.""

""Throughout her campaign, Lake has counted Nazi sympathizers and far-right extremists as part of her coalition,"" she said. ""We know where she stands on the issues that matter most, vowing to ban abortion and reproductive health care, putting cameras in our children's classrooms, and wasting taxpayer money relitigating the 2020 election and manipulating future elections if she doesn't like the results.""

Notably, Ducey has not publicly responded to his candidate's loss and Lake's win yet, and although he's chair of the Republican Governors Association, it was his vice-chair, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who was quoted in the organization's release congratulating Lake.

""Arizona families want a leader who will fight back against the failed policies of Joe Biden and Democrats and that's exactly what they got with Kari Lake - she's a fighter,"" Reynolds said. ""The RGA congratulates Kari on her primary victory, and we look forward to working to get her elected governor this November.""

Despite a handful of hypocrisy scandals, with Pence swiping her as a ""convert"" to the GOP who donated to Barack Obama, Lake acknowledged her past support for Democratic causes on the campaign trail, but now takes a far-right stance on social issues. She opposes abortion and transgender rights and made election integrity and border security top campaign issues, saying she would declare an invasion at the southern border on day one as governor.

Entering the general election season, Lake has already said that she would not change her tone but continue to talk about the widely disproven conspiracy that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, even as some Republicans are concerned that if Trump's candidates don't moderate their message for the general electorate, it will be harder to win in Arizona in November.

Arizona Republican strategist Barrett Marson, who supported Taylor Robson, told ABC News, ""It'll be up to them [the Trump candidates] to moderate, or to at least start to appeal to the broader audience. I just don't get telling your voters that there's fraud in the election that you won and then expect them to continue to come out and vote for you.""

Lake dismissed questions Wednesday on how she could declare victory in an election that she doesn't have any confidence in and why voters should trust that she won this election fair and square, claiming to have evidence of irregularities but refusing to provide evidence of wrongdoing to the press.

""We're going with the votes, and we're going with what the people who really understand what's happening [in this] this election now,"" she said.

A first-time candidate for public office who has said she would not have fulfilled her legal duty to certify it in 2020, Lake said, if elected governor, she would sign legislation to eliminate electronic counting machines and move to ""one-day voting"" in the state where voting by mail is a popular method. On the night of her election-watch party in Scottsdale, she wielded a wooden sledgehammer she said was intended for electronic voting machines and Hobbs.

With Lake's win official, Trump sees a slate of winning candidates in Arizona, his most primary wins in any state -- and in one that helped deliver the presidency to Joe Biden.

""President Trump went 14-0 in Arizona as the MAGA wave continues to sweep across the nation. America is a nation in decline under Democrat leadership, but President Trump will not stop until America is made great once more through the election of America First fighters,"" Taylor Budowich, a spokesperson for Trump, said in a statement Wednesday to ABC News.

One strategist told ABC News the wins prove that Arizona, though it has taken on a purple hue in recent years, is ""still very much Trump country.""

Taylor Robson told ""Good Morning America"" and ""World News Tonight"" weekend co-anchor Whit Johnson that Lake priming her supporters for a stolen election -- before Lake ultimately won the election herself -- should ""disqualify"" her from the race, as many voters in Arizona are already mistrusting in the election process.

In a statement late Thursday, Taylor Robson said she accepted the results of the election and congratulated Lake on the win.

""This part of my life's journey has come to an end. Now I need to be with my family and get back to my business,"" she said.

""The voters of Arizona have spoken, I accept the results, I trust the process and the people who administer it,"" she continued. ""I have spent my life supporting Republican candidates and causes and it is my hope that our Republican nominees are successful in November.""

While Trump's endorsed candidates are dominating the Arizona primary races, it was unclear if the MAGA agenda would show the same success in November."

Turnout in the summertime primary spiked to nearly the same level of the 2018 midterm general election.
Republicans, meanwhile, insist the wind is still at their backs -- though even some GOP operatives acknowledge the Kansas results indicate that their gains could be curtailed as the party largely embraces a strict anti-abortion agenda.
""When voters know that abortion is on the ballot, they show up and they send a resounding message,"" said Democratic pollster Molly Murphy.
""There’s no doubt overturning Roe has given Democrats some momentum,"" said one GOP strategist working on midterm races.","“When voters know ... abortion is on the ballot, they show up,"" a pollster said.

Tuesday night's lopsided result in the Kansas abortion referendum -- which saw the anti-abortion measure defeated some 59-41 in a traditionally red state -- has Democrats and Republicans wondering if the post-Roe fight over the social issue marks a sea change in the midterm landscape or a less dramatic shift in an environment that still favors the GOP.

The proposed amendment, which gave voters a direct choice over whether or not to strip the state constitution's abortion protections, marked the first tangible answer to the question of how June's Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade will influence the electorate.

Turnout in the summertime primary spiked to nearly the same level of the 2018 midterm general election. And with an approximately 18-point win for abortion access advocates in one of the nation's conservative bastions, debate is underway among many over whether that victory could ripple outward.

Democrats who spoke with ABC News insist they have a new lease on life after being pummeled by President Joe Biden's low approval rating, historic inflation, high gas prices, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and more.

Republicans, meanwhile, insist the wind is still at their backs -- though even some GOP operatives acknowledge the Kansas results indicate that their gains could be curtailed as the party largely embraces a strict anti-abortion agenda.

""If I were a Republican House or Senate candidate or a Republican strategist, I would be panicking right now,"" said Democratic strategist Jon Reinish. ""Voters are furious, and voters are mobilized. Looking at [Tuesday’s] extremely definitive results, I think that this scrambles a lot of conventional wisdom and calculations on the whole midterm landscape this November.""

Had the amendment passed, it would have offered the GOP-controlled state legislature a path to restricting or banning abortion, continuing a pattern seen in other conservative areas of the country. Kansas law currently allows most abortions to take place up to 22 weeks in a pregnancy.

However, Tuesday night's results marked a comprehensive win for abortion rights supporters in a state former President Donald Trump won by nearly 15 points just two years ago and where registered Republicans outpace registered Democrats by hundreds of thousands.

Evert Nelson/usa Today Network/via Reuters

In a sign of intense enthusiasm on the issue, the vote against the amendment significantly outran President Joe Biden's showing in Kansas in 2020.

Abortion access supporters won in Shawnee County, home of Topeka, by a 66-34 margin Tuesday. Biden won the county by only 3 points in 2020.

The same trend followed in Kansas' rural expanses. In Hamilton County, for example, abortion opponents only defeated the amendment by about 12 points, whereas Trump beat Biden in the county in 2020 by 65 points.

Democratic operatives cited that as persuasive evidence of an argument they've made since before Roe's demise: Abortion has the power to supercharge turnout in a midterm cycle that was previously expected to be characterized by a depressed Democratic base, given Biden's unpopularity and economic headwinds.

""When voters know that abortion is on the ballot, they show up and they send a resounding message,"" said Democratic pollster Molly Murphy. ""Republicans are on the wrong side of that message, and as voters learn what Republicans' priorities are if they take power, it is incredibly encouraging to see the way voters will respond.""

""Voters understand the difference between the parties on abortion, and they are increasingly seeing Republicans take steps to ban it,"" Murphy said, ""which can help create a real choice between the two parties.""

Leading Democrats seized on the results Wednesday.

""The voters of Kansas sent a powerful signal that this fall the American people will vote to preserve and protect the rights and refuse to let them be ripped away by politicians,"" Biden said in remarks before his interagency task force meeting on reproductive health care.

""The people of Kansas spoke yesterday, and they spoke loud and clear. They said this is not a partisan issue,"" Vice President Kamala Harris added in her own remarks. ""The women of America should not be the subject of partisan debate or perspective.""

It's still unclear, though, how much voter enthusiasm on that one issue will translate to Democratic support.

Biden's approval ratings have been stuck in the 30s, weakened in part by dissatisfaction among his base that key campaign promises are mired in the narrowly divided Congress, stymied by legal and administrative uncertainty or blocked by the courts.

ABC News polls and other surveys have also shown that economic issues remain top of mind for voters in a cycle that won't feature many more single-issue referendums like the one in Kansas.

On top of those dynamics, some Republican strategists and pollsters cautioned against extrapolating the results of a unique abortion referendum onto the more typical midterm races this fall.

""A difficult-to-pass constitutional amendment ballot issue in a state does not erase two years of mismanagement, higher costs and incredible dysfunction in Washington,"" said GOP pollster Robert Blizzard. ""For those on the left and in the media breathlessly trying to change the political headwinds facing the Democratic Party, they should be reminded the midterm elections will not be an up-or-down [vote] on codifying abortion but instead a referendum on Biden, the economy and dysfunction in D.C.""

On top of that, the timing of Tuesday's referendum could offer advice to Republicans running this November on how to message on abortion to avoid the significant backlash seen in Kansas.

Democrats have been pouncing on some states' efforts to outright ban abortion, even in instances of rape and incest -- proposals some Republicans said should be avoided.

""This result does not mean pro-choice candidates are going to win in a rout this November. Other issues are still far more important, and candidates are a bundle of issues. The key for Republican candidates is to back away from a total ban and get in line with public opinion, including conservative opinion, that favors time limits and exceptions for the mother's health,"" said one GOP strategist.

Still, Republicans conceded they may have to temper their expectations for the fall.

Last year's election results in Virginia, where now-Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won by 2 points in a state Biden took by 10 points in 2020, had the GOP boasting that even congressional districts Biden won by 10 points were no longer safe.

But with such a potent and prominent issue giving Democrats late momentum, operatives now say Republicans' target lists may face a crunch even as their chances of flipping the House remain strong.

""There’s no doubt overturning Roe has given Democrats some momentum,"" said one GOP strategist working on midterm races. ""It seems the front-line races this fall won’t be as far down as a lot of folks had hoped. I think realistically we’re back to where D+5 districts are the front-line battles this fall."""

If conservatives were going to retrench after this week's vote in Kansas, the governor of Florida did not get the memo.

And if Republicans were supposed to wait on former President Donald Trump to signal any 2024 intentions, that same man is writing a different ticket on that, as well.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is taking the fight over abortion rights to a provocative and newly aggressive front with his move to suspend an elected prosecutor even before he does or doesn't prosecute individuals accused of violating the state's new abortion ban.

""You have neglected your duty and you are displaying a lack of competence to be able to perform those duties,"" DeSantis, R-Fla., said during a Thursday news conference called to suspend Andrew Warren, the Hillsborough County state attorney.

Warren has been elected twice in the Tampa-based county and also emerged as a high-profile critic of DeSantis over COVID restrictions, as well as prosecutions of protests. In case the politics of the moment might be lost, the announcement was previewed the night before by DeSantis' spokeswoman, who Wednesday night promised a development that would provoke a ""liberal media meltdown.""

Warren tweeted that the ""political stunt is an illegal overreach that continues a dangerous pattern by Ron DeSantis of using his office to further his own political ambition.""

Media reaction notwithstanding, DeSantis' likely Democratic opponent this fall, Rep. Charlie Crist, called it the move of a ""wannabe dictator."" The Democratic National Committee called it ""fundamentally un-American"" to ""overturn the will of Florida voters.""

Negotiating the release of basketball star Brittney Griner could be treacherous territory for the Biden administration.

A Russian judge on Thursday sentenced the athlete to nine years in a penal colony after she was convicted of smuggling and storing illegal drugs. Only minutes afterward, the president issued a statement condemning the ruling and the detention of both Griner and Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine charged with espionage by Russian authorities.

""It's unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends and teammates,"" Biden wrote. ""My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible.""

A call last week between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, about a potential prisoner swap didn't yield a resolution. In a Russian readout of the call, officials called for negotiations to take place behind closed doors.

The demands of Russian officials could be steep. They could attempt to use Griner's imprisonment as a bargaining chip on issues beyond a prisoner swap, such as sanctions or policy pertaining to the war in Ukraine.

In the shadow of a foreign policy win for the Biden administration (the killing of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri), Griner's sentence presents an enormous challenge on the world stage without any clear solutions.

In less than two weeks, Wyoming voters will conclude their referendum on Republican Rep. Liz Cheney's future in the House as she digs in on her anti-Trump stance in the lead-up to primary day.

The latest example of Cheney's ""no regrets"" approach to her political moves came in the form of a one-minute ad featuring her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served in the George W. Bush administration.

""In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump. He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He is a coward. A real man wouldn't lie to his supporters,"" the former vice president says in the ad.

It remains to be seen whether the resoluteness of the Cheney legacy falls on deaf ears -- already, a majority of pro-impeachment Republicans have either lost their primaries or chosen to retire. In Wyoming, Trump won by a landslide in 2020, earning 70% of the vote.

The Aug. 16 primary is sure to be an uphill battle for Cheney, but it may not signal the end of her political career.

""Liz is fearless. She never backs down from a fight. There is nothing more important she will ever do than lead the effort to make sure Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office. And she will succeed,"" the elder Cheney says in the ad.

According to Cheney's campaign, the ad will run ""statewide and across all online and streaming platforms on Friday.""

11. That's the percentage of Americans who said they were following updates regarding monkeypox very closely, per a May survey from YouGov/The Economist. Thirty-three percent said they were paying some attention, but the majority of Americans (56%) said they weren't following it closely. On Thursday, U.S. health officials declared monkeypox a public health emergency, freeing up additional resources for vaccines and other treatments to help control the virus' outbreak, so it's possible Americans will start paying more attention. But as FiveThirtyEight's Alex Samuels writes, it could be that most Americans aren't that worried about monkeypox.

PINGTUNG, Taiwan -- Taiwan warned Tuesday that Chinese military drills aren't just a rehearsal for an invasion of the self-governing island but also reflect ambitions to control large swaths of the western Pacific, as Taipei conducted its own exercises to underscore it's ready to defend itself.

Angered by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's recent visit to Taiwan, China has sent military ships and planes across the midline that separates the two sides in the Taiwan Strait and launched missiles into waters surrounding the island. The drills, which began Thursday, have disrupted flights and shipping in one of the busiest zones for global trade.

Ignoring calls to calm tensions, Beijing instead extended the exercises without announcing when they will end.

Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said that beyond aiming to annex the island democracy, which split with the mainland amid civil war in 1949, China wants to establish its dominance in the western Pacific. That would include controlling of the East and South China Seas via the Taiwan Strait and imposing a blockade to prevent the U.S. and its allies from aiding Taiwan in the event of an attack, he told a news conference in Taipei.

The exercises show China’s “geostrategic ambition beyond Taiwan,” which Beijing claims as its own territory, Wu said.

“China has no right to interfere in or alter” Taiwan's democracy or its interactions with other nations, he added.

Wu’s assessment of China’s maneuvers was grimmer than that of other observers but echoed widespread concerns that Beijing is seeking to expand its influence in the Pacific, where the U.S. has military bases and extensive treaty partnerships.

China has said its drills were prompted by Pelosi's visit, but Wu said Beijing was using her trip as a pretext for intimidating moves long in the works. China also banned some Taiwanese food imports after the visit and cut off dialogue with the U.S. on a range of issues from military contacts to combating transnational crime and climate change.

Pelosi also dismissed China’s outrage as a public stunt, noting on NBC’s “Today” show that “nobody said a word” about a Senate delegation a few visit months ago. Later on the MSNBC news network, she said Chinese President Xi Jinping was acting like a “scared bully.”

“I don’t think the president of China should control the schedules of members of Congress,” she said.

Through its maneuvers, China has pushed closer to Taiwan’s borders and may be seeking to establish a new normal in which it could eventually control access to the island’s ports and airspace. But that would likely elicit a strong response from the military on the island, whose people strongly favor the status quo of de-facto independence.

The U.S., Taipei’s main backer, has also shown itself to be willing to face down Beijing’s threats. Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan in deference to Beijing, but is legally bound to ensure the island can defend itself and to treat all threats against it as matters of grave concern.

That leaves open the question of whether Washington would dispatch forces if China attacked Taiwan. U.S. President Joe Biden has said repeatedly the U.S. is bound to do so — but staff members have quickly walked back those comments.

Beyond the geopolitical risks, an extended crisis in the Taiwan Strait, a significant thoroughfare for global trade, could have major implications for international supply chains at a time when the world is already facing disruptions and uncertainty in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine. In particular, Taiwan is a crucial provider of computer chips for the global economy, including China’s high-tech sectors.

In response to the drills, Taiwan has put its forces on alert, but has so far refrained from taking active counter measures.

On Tuesday, its military held live-fire artillery drills in Pingtung County on its southeastern coast.

The army will continue to train and accumulate strength to deal with the threat from China, said Maj, Gen. Lou Woei-jye, spokesperson for Taiwan's 8th Army Command. “No matter what the situation is ... this is the best way to defend our country.”

Taiwan, once a Japanese colony, had only loose connections to imperial China and then split with the mainland in 1949. Despite never having governed the island, China's ruling Communist Party regards it as its own territory and has sought to isolate it diplomatically and economically in addition to ratcheting up military threats.

Washington has insisted Pelosi's visit did not change its “one China policy,” which holds that the United States has no position on the status of the two sides but wants their dispute settled peacefully.

LOS ANGELES -- The driver suspected of causing a fiery crash that killed five people, including a pregnant woman, was charged Monday with murder.

Nicole Lorraine Linton was charged with six counts of murder and five counts of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. One murder charge was filed for the pregnant woman's unborn child.

She could face 90 years to life in prison if convicted of all charges.

Linton, a 37-year-old traveling nurse from Houston, Texas, made her first court appearance Monday after being released from a hospital over the weekend. Linton, who appeared in a wheelchair, didn't enter a plea and her arraignment was continued to October. She was ordered held without bail pending a bail hearing next week.

Prosecutors said Linton's Mercedes-Benz was doing 90 mph (144 kph) last Thursday when it ran a red light and smashed into cars in a crowded intersection in unincorporated Windsor Hills about 10 miles (16 km) southwest of downtown Los Angeles. Several victims were thrown from the cars and several vehicles caught fire.

The crash killed 23-year-old Asherey Ryan, her 11-month-old son Alonzo Quintero and her boyfriend, Reynold Lester, Sha’seana Kerr said in a GoFundMe posting.

Lester’s family told KABC-TV that the 24-year-old security guard was the father of Ryan’s 8 1/2-month-old unborn child. The family has said Ryan was on the way to a doctor’s appointment for a prenatal checkup when she was killed.

One murder charge — but not an additional charge of vehicular manslaughter — was filed for the fetus, who was identified by the coroner’s office as Armani Lester and listed as born on the same day he died.

“A young family was destroyed in the blink of an eye,” District Attorney George Gascón said at a news conference.

Two other women were also killed but their names weren’t made public as of Monday.

“While the wreckage of this fiery crash at this intersection was removed and traffic eventually resumed, there is catastrophic damage to the families and friends of those killed and injured,"" Gascón said. “It is not only a tremendous loss to the families but our entire community who learned of this incredible tragedy or have watched the now viral video of the collision,"" he said.

OMAHA, Neb. -- Warren Buffett's company has bought up more than $11 billion worth of Occidental Petroleum stock this year, giving Berkshire Hathaway control of more than 20% of the oil producer.

Occidental's stock rose more than 3.5% on Tuesday to $62.18 after Buffett revealed his latest purchases of nearly 6.7 million Occidental shares worth more than $400 million.

Wall Street follows Buffett's actions closely, including his investments in Occidental Petroleum. Its shares have more than doubled in price this year.

Berkshire has repeatedly acquired shares of the Houston driller whenever the stock falls below $60 in recent months. Buffett also dropped more than $20 billion on Chevron stock in the first quarter of this year and took advantage of the surge in oil prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. Berkshire's Chevron stake is worth more than $24 billion.

That means Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska, conglomerate holds nearly $47 billion in oil sector investments because Berkshire holds another $10 billion worth of preferred Occidental shares that it picked up in 2019 when it helped finance Occidental's purchase of Anadarko.

And Buffett may not be done. Berkshire owns warrants to buy another 83.9 million Occidental shares at $59.62 apiece. Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan estimates that Berkshire's oil sector holdings are worth $46.6 billion today even without the value of those warrants.

Because Berkshire now owns 20.2% of Occidental's stock, it will be allowed to record a proportional share of the oil producer's earnings on its earnings reports. That could provide a roughly $2 billion a year boost to Berkshire's bottom line.

Buffett aggressively invested in stocks this year when the market was weighed down by soaring inflation and rising interest rates. Berkshire spent more than $51 billion on stocks in the first quarter, but the pace of its investments slowed considerably in the second quarter when it was a net buyer of only $3.8 billion in stocks with much of that going into Occidental. Berkshire will detail all its second-quarter stock purchases later this month.

In addition to the stakes it holds in companies, Berkshire owns more than 90 companies outright, including BNSF railroad, Geico insurance, several major utilities and an eclectic assortment of manufacturing and retail businesses like See's Candy, Dairy Queen, Helzberg Diamonds, Fruit of the Loom and Precision Castparts. Most of those businesses have performed well this year, but Berkshire reported a $44 billion quarterly loss over the weekend on a sharp drop in the paper value of its stock portfolio."

Several countries in Europe dependent on Russian energy suffered another blow with confirmation Tuesday that oil shipments have stopped through a critical pipeline.

Russian state pipeline operator Transneft said it halted shipments through the southern branch of the Druzhba oil pipeline, which flows through Ukraine to the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.

Transneft cited complications due to European Union sanctions for its action on Aug. 4, saying its payment to the company's Ukrainian counterpart was refused.

The northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through Belarus to Poland and Germany, was unaffected, Transneft reported.

EU leaders agreed in May to embargo most Russian oil imports by the end of the year as part of the bloc's sanctions over Moscow's war in Ukraine.

The embargo covers Russian oil brought in by sea but allowed temporary Druzhba pipeline shipments to Hungary and certain other landlocked countries in central Europe.

Slovakia’s oil pipeline network operator, Transpetrol, and the refining company Slovnaft confirmed that Druzhba shipments to the nation had stopped. Slovakia receives almost all its oil through the Druzhba pipeline.

Slovnaft, which is owned by Hungary’s MOL energy group, said its production has not been affected.

Slovnaft spokesperson Anton Molnar said the company and MOL were discussing with Russia and Ukraine an option for MOL, or Slovnaft, to pay the transit fees.

“The following days will show if it’s another escalation of the energy war by Russia or a technical problem about payments,” Czech Industry and Trade Minister Jozef Sikela said.

Slovakia’s economy minister, Richard Sulik, previously said his country has enough oil in its reserves for about 120 days.

Russia has also curtailed natural gas shipments to Europe after most countries refused to abide by Russian President Vladimir Putin's wartime order requiring payments in rubles instead of dollars or euros.

DETROIT -- Drivers lined up early Tuesday to get free gas in Detroit from a man who spent eight years in prison before he was cleared of four killings.

Davontae Sanford limited the $25,000 offer to women and older men.

“The city had my back, so it’s only right I give back to the city and I give back to the most vulnerable,” Sanford told WJBK-TV.

The Detroit City Council in March agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle Sanford's claim that police had violated his rights.

Sanford was 15 when he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the fatal shootings of four people in 2007. He later insisted he was innocent and took a plea deal only because he felt helpless and poorly represented by a lawyer.

The case took a strange turn when a hit man, Vincent Smothers, stepped forward and said he was responsible for the killings, not Sanford.

In 2016, the convictions were dropped at the request of Wayne County prosecutor Kym Worthy, who cited police misconduct, not Smothers' confession.

Smothers has never been charged in the Runyon Street homicides. He is prison for eight other killings."

WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- The United States is doubling down on its investment in the Pacific, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Tuesday as she concluded a five-nation visit to the region where China has been making inroads.

“The future will be written here in the Pacific,” Sherman said at an agreement-signing event in New Zealand's capital, Wellington.

Critics have accused the U.S. of neglecting the region and allowing China's influence to flourish.

The Solomon Islands in April signed a security pact with China in a move that has alarmed many in the Pacific who fear it could lead to a military buildup. The U.S. earlier this year announced plans to reopen an embassy in the Solomons, where on Sunday Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare skipped a service commemorating the Battle of Guadalcanal that Sherman she and other dignitaries attended.

Sherman said the U.S. has always been a Pacific nation. She said it has been a priority for President Joe Biden to rebuild alliances and relationships around the world, and officials were using “every vehicle possible” to collaborate with Pacific partners.

“And so we are doubling down on our investment here in the Pacific,” Sherman said. “Our relationships, our partnerships, regional organizations.”

Asked if she felt the U.S. or China was winning the battle for influence in the region, Sherman said she didn't see it quite that way.

“It's not so much a battle,” she said. “I think that countries try to have relations with every country they believe will help them move forward. And the United States does not ask any country to choose between us and China, or any other country and China.""

She said the U.S. wanted a level playing field and respect for the rules-based international order that was put in place after World War II, a system that had helped China rise and which ought to benefit all nations.

Sherman said she had discussed China among a number of topics in a meeting with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

Sherman signed agreements to collaborate more closely with New Zealand on space missions and emergency management. It was the final stop on a trip that had taken her to Samoa, Tonga, the Solomon Islands and Australia.

Sherman spoke more about the decision of the Solomons' prime minister to stay away from Sunday's Guadalcanal commemoration.

“I told him I was sorry for him because I thought he missed an opportunity to raise up that strong partnership and the fight for freedom that allowed the Solomon Islands to exist as it is today,” she said."

SEOUL, South Korea -- Heavy rain with thunder and lightning has battered South Korea's central areas for two straight days, causing damage, injuries and deaths.

Ten people have died and seven more have been reported missing in the heavy rain in the last two days, according to South Korea's Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters. A family of three living in a semi-basement apartment died when their home flooded, in Gwanak-gu, Seoul, officials said.

The heaviest-ever rainfall since South Korea began tracking precipitation data has flooded subway stations and submerged roads and homes.

Korea Meteorological Administration said the rainfall was a result of a strong collision between dry cold air coming from the North and hot humid air from the South.

Thousands of vehicles were submerged in Seoul on Monday night, forcing drivers to abandon their cars on the flooded road to get home. Muddy water brimmed over the river onto the streets and into the vehicles. Public sewers overflowed, not being able to hold the amount of rain that poured fast and hard.

""It rained 140 millimeters (5.5 inches) Monday night in the Dongjak district, Seoul, in just one hour. Seoul city's annual precipitation is 1,400 millimeters (55 inches), which means that in just one hour, one-tenth of Seoul city's yearly rainfall poured in just one part of the city in a very short period,"" Lee Young-joo, professor of fire prevention science at the University of Seoul, told ABC News.

Hundreds of people living in mountainous areas in Seoul were evacuated to prevent damage from landslides Monday night. Civil service workers relocated residents living in lower-level homes and near mountains to temporary shelters. The heavy rain that poured after 6 p.m. Monday was especially harsh on people commuting from work to their homes.

""When I got off work, water was up to my knees and children were struggling to wade through the flooded water,"" Seoul citizen Dong-Ug Yoon told ABC News about his difficult commute home. ""The subway station was full of dirt. The shopkeeper of the underground convenience store was visibly emotional, trying to hold off the water gushing from the station stairs into her store.""

Gangnam district, well known for its posh streets and office buildings, was hit aggressively by the rain due to its topographical traits. The Gangnam subway station area is known to be 30 feet lower than the neighboring subway stations, making it more vulnerable to heavy rain and flood.

""Cars and buses were submerged in the flood so I had to park my car on a relatively safe side of the road and walk home. It took almost two hours trying to find roads that weren't underwater yet,"" Yewon Lee, an organist living in Seoul, told ABC News. ""When I returned early this morning, I found other vehicles that floated down and collapsed into my car.""

The Seoul Metropolitan Government repaired the drainage facility in Gangnam after the area flooded from heavy rain in 2010.

Lee, the professor, said at the amount of rain that poured since Monday was way over the scale a reasonable drainage system could handle.

Multiple sources confirm to ABC News that former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate was raided by FBI agents on Monday.

The sources told ABC News that the search began at around 10 a.m.

The former president put out a statement Monday evening saying federal investigators were there and that they had even gotten into his safe.

Trump was not there at the time of the search.

Sources tell ABC News that the search of Mar-a-Lago was related to the 15 boxes of documents that Trump took to Mar-a-Lago when he departed the White House -- some of which the National Archives has said were marked classified.

In January, Trump handed over the documents to the National Archives, and attorneys for Trump said they were searching for any more records they may have.

Law enforcement sources told ABC News the FBI activities at Trump's compound are court-authorized.

The FBI and Justice Department declined to comment.

Sources said Monday was not the first time that federal agents visited Trump's Florida home. In the spring, according to these sources, a small team of agents went to Mar-a-Lago inquiring about the documents he took with him. The agents went through and reviewed some documents with Trump's attorneys present; Trump himself was also present.

Sources close to Trump said his legal team had some back-and-forth communications then with federal investigators, one even calling the dialogue “cordial” in nature.

A senior official briefed on Monday's events told ABC News that the Secret Service was notified by the FBI a short time before agents arrived that they would be coming. The Secret Service validated the search warrant and facilitated entry into the residence, in accordance with a court order, the official said. Secret Service agents were not involved in the search.

The Secret Service declined to comment. A Biden White House official confirmed to ABC News that they received no advanced notice of the FBI operation.

Following Monday's raid, a growing list of Republicans tweeted, with some attacking the Justice Department and the FBI, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.

He tweeted a statement that read, in part, ""The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization.""

Late Tuesday, Trump appeared at a pre-scheduled tele-rally with Sarah Palin ahead of her special House election in Alaska next week. He didn’t specifically mention the raid but said: ""Another day in paradise. This is a strange day.""

Said was placed on the FBI’s most-wanted list and evaded arrest for more than 12 years. Said, who had worked as a cab driver, was arrested in August 2020 in Justin, Texas. He entered a not guilty plea and faces an automatic life sentence if convicted.

Prosecutors claim Said, who is Muslim, murdered his daughters because he was upset that the girls were dating.

""He wouldn't even let these girls go to a movie. He wouldn't let them date,” a prosecutor said during closing statements Tuesday.

ABC News local affiliate WFAA reported that police have described the murders as “honor killings” — defined as the killing of a relative, especially a girl or woman, who is perceived to have brought dishonor on the family in certain cultures.

During the trial, prosecutors read a December 21, 2007, email Amina wrote to her history teacher 10 days before she and her sister were killed, saying their father “made our lives a nightmare” and that she and her sister wanted to run away.

“I am so scared right now,” Amina wrote, according to prosecutors. “OK, well as you know we’re not allowed to date and my dad is arranging my marriage. My dad said I cannot put it off any more and I have to get married this year.""

“He will, without any drama nor doubt, kill us,” she also wrote.

The girls, along with their mother and their boyfriends, fled their Texas home to Oklahoma on Christmas Day 2007, four days after Amina sent the email. Witnesses said the girls returned to the Dallas area on New Year's Eve when their mother, Patricia Owens, said Said convinced her to return home.

The girls' bodies were found on New Year’s Day 2008 in a taxi cab prosecutors said Said drove.

Last Wednesday, the prosecution played the 911 call Sarah allegedly made the night of her death. During the call, a woman can be heard frantically screaming that her father had shot her and that she was dying.

During her testimony in court last Thursday Owens pointed to her ex-husband, calling him “that devil.” She testified that Said was controlling and abusive throughout their relationship, adding that she and her daughters left him several times over the years, but they always returned out of fear.

Owens declined to comment on the case until her ex-husband is convicted, she told ABC News.

In a letter written to the judge overseeing the case, Said said while he disapproved of his daughters’ “dating activity,” he denied killing the girls.

“I was upset because in my culture it’s something to get upset about,” said Said, who took the stand Monday. He testified that he immigrated to the U.S. from Egypt in 1983 and later became a U.S. citizen.

Said told jurors that the evening his daughters were killed, he was taking them to dinner because he wanted to smooth things over and “solve the problem.""

However, Said claims he left the vehicle, fleeing into a wooded area before the girls were killed because he thought someone wanted to murder him, testifying that he spotted an unknown person in a car stalking them while they were driving to dinner.

Said said he did not turn himself in after the murders because he didn't think he would get a fair trial.

The defense team claims that Said was targeted by law enforcement because of his Muslim faith and cultural beliefs.

""Everybody has a preference in how they discipline their kids, just like they have a preference for what kind of food they eat, what kind of people they date, what religion they want to practice,"" Baharan Muse, Said's defense attorney, said in closing arguments Tuesday. ""Discipline does not mean you murdered your children. Your culture does not mean you murdered your children.""

Said's defense team alleged prosecutors sought to ""generalize"" and ""criminalize an entire culture, to fit their narrative.""

The prosecution rejected the claim that Said was unjustly accused for his religious beliefs.

""If you intentionally or knowingly cause the death of another in Dallas County, we are coming for you. Period. You will be prosecuted. Period. It has nothing to do with your race or religion,"" prosecutor Lauren Black said in her closing argument."

The frustrations of a community still reeling from a mass shooting were on full display Monday night as a procession of Uvalde residents confronted school district leaders over their response to the massacre that claimed the lives of 19 students and two teachers.

Trustees of the Uvalde CISD School Board convened the special session to present plans for the upcoming school year, including upgrading security measures and an announcement that all students K-12 would be offered the opportunity to attend classes virtually.

But during the open forum portion of the evening, attention returned to the fallout from the May 24 shooting at Robb Elementary School.

""We want results,"" one man said. ""Has anybody lost their job? Has anyone been terminated?""

""We still need answers,"" a woman added.

""This is not going to be swept under the rug,"" said another.

More than two-and-a-half months since the shooting, several of the roughly 100 attendees sought basic answers about the law enforcement response, including chain-of-command communication.

When board trustee JJ Suarez, a former police officer who responded to Robb Elementary, told one questioner that he did not remember who told him the shooting was ""a barricade situation"" and claimed not to have heard gunshots from inside the school, members of the audience heckled him.

""I heard the shots,"" one woman shouted before imitating the sound of gun shots. ""I still hear that sound.""

Suarez replied that his failure to ask if children were still inside the classrooms will ""haunt [him] every day.""

Trustees also faced questions about school district police chief Pete Arredondo and why a decision whether to fire him has not yet been made. The board responded that it is following ""due process,"" adding that it is considering multiple new dates for a hearing on Arredondo's future.

Arredondo remains on leave while an investigation into the conduct of law enforcement during the shooting on May 24 marches forward. Last month, the Uvalde school district postponed a closed hearing to consider whether to terminate Arredondo as its police chief and has not yet set a new date.

A special committee in the Texas legislature issued a report last month that found Arredondo had ""failed to perform or to transfer to another person the role of incident commander."" Arredondo previously told the Texas Tribune he did not consider himself the on-scene commander during the shooting.

After multiple media outlets, including ABC News, reported on a demotion Arredondo received in 2014 at a prior job, Superintendent Dr. Hal Harrell acknowledged that he made the decision to hire Arredondo and said he contacted previous employers but was not told about the demotion.

Harrell also laid out several new initiatives taken by the board to shore up security across the school district in the coming year. Those updates include:

33 Texas DPS officers being assigned to UCISD

500 cameras being installed across the district

Campus monitor role to be created -- this person will walk school grounds throughout the day, noting lock, gate and door statuses on an iPad that the district will then be able to review

Each school will have a single point of entry all students, faculty and guests must utilize

An audit on the district's Wi-Fi set to be completed Wednesday

Other notable speakers at Monday's session included a woman who said her daughter with special needs cannot reasonably attend class virtually, and a rising fourth grader in the school district who requested upgrades to school lighting, automatic door locks and the installation of ballistic glass. (Harrell had said earlier in the meeting they were still looking for funds for ballistic glass.)

After fielding concern about the conduct of school administrators and law enforcement moving forward, Harrell said ""it's going to take a while to regain that trust.""

""The trust has been damaged. The trust has been broken,"" Harrell said. ""It's going to take all of us to fix it."""

Kiely Rodni, 16, was last seen early Saturday around 12:30 a.m. local time near the Prosser Family Campground in the small, Northern California town of Truckee, some 20 miles north of Lake Tahoe. She was at a party with more than 100 people when she vanished along with her vehicle, a silver 2013 Honda CRV with California license plates.

When Rodni's mother awoke that morning to find her daughter still not home and her car missing from their driveway, panic began to set in.

""I called her and sent her texts too, and she didn't answer,"" Rodni-Nieman said. ""That's when I knew something was wrong.""

The parents of a 12-year-old California girl who died last year after an accident involving an electric bike, or e-bike, say they want to see change.

Kaye and Jonathan Steinsapir, the parents of Molly Steinsapir, have filed a lawsuit against Rad Power Bikes, a Seattle-based e-bike company.

According to the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior County Court, Molly and her 11-year-old best friend were riding a RadRunner bike on Jan. 31, 2021, with Molly riding on the back. As the friends were going down a steep hill, the bike, ""began to shake and wobble, causing the bike to crash.""

Molly died on Feb. 15, 2021, after undergoing multiple brain surgeries and spending more than two weeks in the hospital, with her parents by her side.

""I massaged her hands and her feet and sang to her and read to her,"" Kaye Steinsapir, whose tweets about Molly's fight to survive started a following known as ""Team Molly,"" told ABC News. ""I read the book that her class was reading because I didn't want her to be behind when she woke up.""

In their lawsuit, the Steinsapirs claim that the model of bike Molly was riding, Rad Power Bikes' RadRunner, has ""multiple design defects,"" including an issue with the brakes and front wheel that, according to the lawsuit, ""in some cases can cause the wheel to come all the way off.""

The family claims in the lawsuit that Rad Power Bikes, ""knew or should have known that this was an unsafe and defective design.""

""Rad Power Bikes was aware of this issue or had been made aware of this issue, and they never redesigned their bike,"" Jonathan Steinsapir told ""Good Morning America"" in his family's first television interview about the lawsuit. ""So this was, what we believe, was preventable.""

Kaye and Jonathan Steinsapir pose with their three children in this undated family photo. Kaye and Jonathan Steinsapir

E-bikes have a motor and often have more power than a normal bike.

Rad Power Bikes' RadRunner model is capable of reaching speeds up to 20 miles per hour, according to the lawsuit.

Molly was wearing a helmet while riding the e-bike, according to her parents. The maker of the helmet Molly was wearing, Giro Sport Design, is also named in the lawsuit.

Giro Sport Design did not reply to ABC News' request for comment.

Rad Power Bikes told ABC News in a statement it ""extends its deepest condolences to the Steinsapir family.""

The company said it does not comment on pending litigation.

In the lawsuit, the Steinsapirs claim the owner's manual for the RadRunner, the type of bike Molly was riding, says in small print on page 49, out of 57 pages, it is ""designed for use by persons 18 years and older. The lawsuit alleges that Rad Power Bikes ""knows children will operate"" the bike since the company's website includes what the suit describes as ""glowing reviews from adults"" about buying the bike for their children.

""Let's be honest, no one reads manuals. We all know that,"" Jonathan Steinsapir said. ""The first step Rad should have is something on the bike itself warning about age appropriateness.""

The Steinsapirs said they are filing the lawsuit in hopes of preventing tragedy for another family.

""I would much rather just walk away from this and just go on with my life,"" Jonathan Steinsapir said. ""But you know, the next child who dies or is paralyzed because of this issue that they refuse to address, I mean I couldn't possibly live with myself with that.""

Added his wife, Kaye, ""Every single time I just hear Molly. I hear her voice say, 'Mom, it's not okay. It's not right,' that that's who Molly was. She is somebody who stood up for what is right and no matter what the personal cost, and there is tremendous personal cost to us in pursuing this litigation.""

Dr. Charles DiMaggio, a faculty member in the department of surgery, division of trauma and critical care at New York University School of Medicine, told ABC News that e-bikes represent ""potentially a revolution"" in how people get around, but that they need to be considered with safety first.

""They need to be introduced in a safe way,"" DiMaggio said. ""Engineering them in a way so that they stop and brake appropriately and safely, so that they are not necessarily going faster than they need to go and by marketing them to the appropriate age groups.""

Greg Billing, executive Director at the Washington Area Bicyclist Association, told ABC News in an interview in 2020 that accidents with e-bikes can and do happen – that’s why it’s imperative for users to practice safety.

""It is a different skill than just riding a bike,"" Billing said then. ""Which is why we encourage people when they are starting to use e-bikes to really practice and understand how to handle the power of the bike and make sure that they feel comfortable before they get out on the road or on a trail around other people or cars."""

The Republican matchup in the Wisconsin governor's race on Tuesday features competing candidates endorsed by former President Donald Trump and his estranged vice president, Mike Pence. Democrats are picking a candidate to face two-term GOP Sen. Ron Johnson for control of the closely divided chamber.

Meanwhile, voters in Vermont are choosing a replacement for U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy as the chamber's longest-serving member retires. In Minnesota, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar faces a Democratic primary challenger who helped defeat a voter referendum to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety.

What to watch in Tuesday's primary elections in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Vermont and Connecticut:

WISCONSIN

Construction company co-owner Tim Michels has Trump’s endorsement in the governor's race and has been spending millions of his own money, touting both the former president's backing and his years working to build his family’s business into Wisconsin’s largest construction company. Michels casts himself as an outsider, although he previously lost a campaign to oust then-U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold in 2004 and has long been a prominent GOP donor.

Establishment Republicans including Pence and former Gov. Scott Walker have endorsed former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, who along with Walker, survived a 2012 recall effort. She argues she has the experience and knowledge to pursue conservative priorities, including dismantling the bipartisan commission that runs elections.

With Senate control at stake, Democrats will also make their pick to take on Johnson. Democratic support coalesced around Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes late in the race, when his three top rivals dropped out and threw their support to him. He would become the state’s first Black senator if elected.

Several lesser-known candidates remain in the primary, but Johnson and Republicans have treated Barnes as the nominee, casting him as too liberal for Wisconsin, a state Trump won in 2016 but lost in 2020.

Four Democrats are also running in Wisconsin’s 3rd Congressional District, a seat that opened up with the retirement of veteran Democratic U.S. Rep. Ron Kind. The district has been trending Republican, and Derrick Van Orden — who narrowly lost to Kind in 2020 and has Trump’s endorsement — is running unopposed.

MINNESOTA

Democratic Gov. Tim Walz faces a little-known opponent as he seeks a second term. His likely challenger is Republican Scott Jensen, a physician and former state lawmaker who has made vaccine skepticism a centerpiece of his campaign and faces token opposition.

Both men have been waging a virtual campaign for months, with Jensen attacking Walz for his management of the pandemic and hammering the governor for rising crime around Minneapolis. Walz has highlighted his own support of abortion rights and suggested that Jensen would be a threat to chip away at the procedure’s legality in Minnesota.

Crime has emerged as the biggest issue in Rep. Omar's Democratic primary. She faces a challenge from former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels, who opposes the movement to defund the police and last year helped defeat efforts to replace the city's police department. Omar, who supported the referendum, has a substantial money advantage and is expected to benefit from a strong grassroots operation.

The most confusing part of Tuesday’s ballot was for the 1st Congressional District seat that was held by U.S. Rep. Jim Hagedorn, who died earlier this year from cancer. Republican former state Rep. Brad Finstad and Democrat Jeff Ettinger, a former Hormel CEO, are simultaneously competing in primaries to determine the November matchup for the next two-year term representing the southern Minnesota district, as well as a special election to finish the last few months of Hagedorn’s term.

CONNECTICUT

It’s been roughly three decades since Connecticut had a Republican in the U.S. Senate, but the party isn't giving up.

In the GOP primary to take on Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the party has endorsed former state House Minority Leader Themis Klarides. She's a social moderate who supports abortion rights and certain gun control measures and says she did not vote for Trump in 2020. Klarides contends her experience and positions can persuade voters to oppose Blumenthal, a two-term senator who in May registered a 45% job approval rating, his lowest in a Quinnipiac poll since taking office.

Klarides is being challenged by conservative attorney Peter Lumaj and Republican National Committee member Leora Levy, whom Trump endorsed last week. Both candidates oppose abortion rights and further gun restrictions, and they back Trump's policies.

VERMONT

Leahy's upcoming retirement has opened up two seats in Vermont's tiny three-person congressional delegation — and the opportunity for the state to send a woman to represent it in Washington for the first time.

Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, the state's at-large congressman, quickly launched his Senate bid after Leahy revealed he was stepping down. Leahy, who is president pro tempore of the Senate, has been hospitalized a couple of times over the last two years, including after breaking his hip this summer.

Welch has been endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and is the odds-on favorite to win the seat in November. He faces two other Democrats in the primary: Isaac Evans-Frantz, an activist, and Dr. Niki Thran, an emergency physician.

On the Republican side, former U.S. Attorney Christina Nolan, retired U.S. Army officer Gerald Malloy and investment banker Myers Mermel are competing for the nomination.

The race to replace Welch has yielded Vermont’s first wide-open U.S. House campaign since 2006.

Two women, including Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and state Senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint, are the top Democratic candidates in the race. Gray, elected in 2020 in her first political bid, is a lawyer and a former assistant state attorney general.

The winner of the Democratic primary will be the heavy favorite to win the general election in the liberal state. In 2018, Vermont became the last state without female representation in Congress when Mississippi Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith was appointed to the Senate.

Rudy Giuliani, the attorney for former President Donald Trump, is seeking to delay his court-ordered testimony before a Georgia grand jury probing efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state, according to new court filings.

Giuliani, who helped lead Trump's legal fight as he unsuccessfully sought to overturn the results of the election nationwide, was set to appear before a Fulton County grand jury on Tuesday, according to a court order.

But Giuliani has sought to delay his testimony, according to court filings, claiming his doctor has not yet cleared him for travel after undergoing a medical procedure.

The Fulton County district attorney leading the probe opposed the delay, claiming that Giuliani had already traveled out of state since his surgery. Attorneys for Giuliani clarified they were referring specifically to air travel, to which the DA offered to ""provide alternate transportation including bus or train if your client maintains that he is unable to fly,"" according to an email correspondence filed in court.

A motion hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in Fulton County Superior Court.

Lawyers for Giuliani said he is in ""no way seeking to inappropriately delay"" his testimony and ""is and has been willing to cooperate in this matter subject to any ethical obligations that may preclude that cooperation.""

The testimony was set to come as the 18-month-old criminal investigation in Georgia appears to be ramping up.

Last month, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis issued a series of subpoenas to Trump attorneys and allies, including lawyers John Eastman and Jenna Ellis, Sen. Lindsey Graham, and Rep. Jody Hice.

Willis officially launched the investigation in February 2021, sparked in part by the Jan. 2, 2021, phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which he pleaded with Raffensperger to ""find 11,780 votes,"" the exact number Trump needed to win Georgia.

A special grand jury was seated in May 2022.

As part of his efforts to overturn the results of the election in Georgia, Giuliani appeared during a December 2020 hearing before state lawmakers at which he presented since-debunked allegations that poll workers had suitcases containing illegitimate ballots.

Graham, in the meantime, has been engaged in an ongoing legal fight to quash the subpoena he received last month as part of the investigation. A hearing in the matter is scheduled for Wednesday in the Northern District of Georgia.

Graham last week added Trump's first White House counsel, Donald McGahn, to his legal team as he attempts to fight the subpoena, which identifies him as ""necessary and material witness.""

As part of his argument to quash the subpoena, Graham says that he was acting ""within [his] official legislative responsibilities"" as a senator and chairman of the Judiciary Committee when he allegedly made calls to Georgia officials in the wake of the 2020 election.

During those calls to Raffensperger and others, Graham allegedly asked about ""reexamining certain absentee ballots cast in Georgia in order to explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former President Donald Trump,"" a Fulton County judge wrote in a filing in the case.

""[Graham] possesses unique knowledge concerning the substance of the telephone calls, the circumstances surrounding his decision to make the telephone calls, the logistics of setting up the telephone calls, and any communications between himself, others involved in the planning and execution of the telephone calls, the Trump Campaign, and other known and unknown individuals involved in the multi-state, coordinated efforts to influence the results of the 2020 election in Georgia,"" the judge's filing said."

Famed horror novelist Stephen King is taking a stand against the publishing behemoths that have distributed his work.

King, 74, whose nearly 50-year career includes the best-selling novels, ""Carrie,"" ""It"" and ""Pet Sematary,"" testified Tuesday in a federal antitrust case against the possible merger of publishing powerhouses Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster.

He has been published by Simon & Schuster as well as imprints, or smaller publishers, owned by Penguin Random House.

King made the argument that consolidation of the book industry was bad for writers.

""When I started in this business, there were literally hundreds of imprints,” King testified, according to the Associated Press. “Those businesses were either subsumed, one by one, or they were run out of business.""

“I came because I think that consolidation is bad for competition,” said King, who identified himself on the stand as a ""freelance writer."" The way the industry has evolved, he said, “it becomes tougher and tougher for writers to find money to live on.” King said the payments book publishers make to writers before their book is published, called advances, have dwindled.

Author Stephen King arrives to testify at the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse in Washington, D.C., August 2, 2022. King will testify against his own publisher, Simon & Schuster, on behalf of the government during a trial in which the US Department of Justice is trying to convince a federal judge to prevent the proposed merger of Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster. MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutter

Literary agent Laura Zats told ABC News’ “Start Here” podcast that the proposed deal would mean “fewer people will get chances to break in [to the industry].”

“It becomes less about ‘I am going to take a chance and publish this really interesting piece of art,’” she said, “and it becomes more of ‘what will make the shareholders money next quarter?’”

The deal, worth $2.18 billion, would merge two of the largest publishing houses in the country, and further consolidate the industry. The Department of Justice said the merger “would share control of 90% of the relevant market” in its pre-trial brief.

The 2013 merger of Penguin Group and Random House to form Penguin Random House brought the number of major publishing houses from six to the “Big Five” -- and now it might become four.

“The proposed merger would likely result in authors of anticipated top-selling books receiving smaller advances,” the DOJ wrote in the brief, “meaning authors who labor for years over their manuscripts will be paid less for their efforts and fewer authors will be able to earn a living from writing.”

“When I go out on submission with a book, I am submitting it to as many imprints as possible,” Zats told ABC News.

“When I get an offer on the book from one publisher, I can go to the rest of them and say, ‘Hello, would you like to enter into an auction'… and frankly, that's how authors eat.”

With fewer imprints, the Department of Justice is arguing, there would be less incentive to offer competitive advances for books.

While the Department of Justice is focused on best-selling books published by the major publishing houses, Zats is concerned that an increasingly consolidated industry would affect smaller book publishers and authors, as well.

“We are not talking about millions of dollars here for most people,” said Zats. “We're talking about being able to buy groceries over three years.”"

Gretchen Whitmer over their disgust with restrictions early in the COVID-19 pandemic

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- After questions about guns, politics and COVID-19, a jury was selected Tuesday for the second trial of two men charged with conspiring to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer over their disgust with restrictions early in the pandemic.

The judge and lawyers settled on 18 people, including six alternates, to hear the case against Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr.

They're on trial again after a jury in April couldn't reach a verdict. Two co-defendants were acquitted and two more pleaded guilty earlier.

U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker repeatedly told prospective jurors that some familiarity with the case wouldn't mean exclusion.

“It's not disqualifying to have views one way or the other,” he said. “It's disqualifying if the views become more important than what the law or the evidence is.”

The plot to kidnap the Democratic governor followed training in Wisconsin and Michigan and two trips to scout her second home in northern Michigan, according to evidence in the first trial.

Fox, 39, lived in the Grand Rapids area and Croft, 46, is from Bear, Delaware. They regularly communicated with other extremists who were angry with Whitmer and various public officials, evidence showed.

Convicting or acquitting the men can't be influenced by “whether you like Governor Whitmer or dislike Governor Whitmer,” the judge told the jury pool. “It's not if you think masking mandates or vaccine mandates or any other response was good or bad policy. It's not a proxy for any of those things.”

Some people were dismissed for health reasons or for political views they couldn't set aside. One man, whose mother is an elected county clerk, was scratched after he said he has no tolerance for violence linked to politics.

“I don’t think you would want me on the jury,” he told Fox's lawyer.

The jury will hear secretly recorded conversations and see text messages and social media posts favoring violence. Defense attorneys, however, will hammer away at the credibility of undercover FBI agents and informants who fooled the group into thinking they were allies.

Lawyers for Fox and Croft will argue they were shielded by the First Amendment and entrapped by the government every step of the way.

“Utter nonsense,” Fox's attorney, Christopher Gibbons, said in spring, referring to a kidnapping plan.

Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta were found not guilty at the first trial. Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks earlier pleaded guilty and will testify again against Fox and Croft.

Garbin told jurors at the first trial that the goal was to cause national chaos with a kidnapping close to the election between Joe Biden and then-President Donald Trump.

Whitmer, who will not be called as a trial witness, disclosed Monday night that she tested positive for COVID-19 for the first time and was experiencing mild symptoms. In a recent interview, she said she believes she was the target of an “assassination plot,” not just a kidnapping.

“No one talks about it that way,” Whitmer told The Washington Post.

ISLAMABAD -- A suicide bomber targeted a security convoy in a former Pakistani Taliban stronghold in northwestern Pakistan, killing four soldiers, officials said Tuesday.

No one claimed responsibility for the attack on Monday in North Waziristan, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province that borders Afghanistan. A military statement said four soldiers were martyred in the attack and that an investigation was underway.

The assault came a day after a late night roadside bombing in eastern Afghanistan struck a vehicle carrying members of the Pakistani Taliban, killing a senior leader and three other militants traveling with him.

The Pakistani Taliban blamed intelligence agents for the high-profile killing on Sunday night, without offering evidence or elaborating.

The slain senior leader of the Pakistani Taliban — the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP — was Abdul Wali, also widely known as Omar Khalid Khurasani. On Tuesday, TTP in a statement confirmed the killing of Khurasani, who had a $3 million U.S. bounty on his head. He was a tough negotiator and was part of the TTP team that has been holding peace talks with Pakistani officials in Afghanistan's capital since May.

Khurasani's death was a heavy blow to the TTP, which is in talks with the Pakistani government amid an ongoing cease-fire, announced in May. Isolated militant attacks have continued, though the TTP has not claimed responsibility for any of them since the truce first went into effect. The talks are being hosted by the Afghan Taliban.

Two local Pakistani intelligence officials told The Associated Press that Monday’s suicide bombing in the town of Mir Ali also wounded an unspecified number of civilians and soldiers. The officials would not elaborate and spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media on the record.

North Waziristan and other former tribal regions in northwestern Pakistan were long a base for the Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups until the army claimed a few years back that it cleared the region of insurgents. Occasional attacks have continued, however, raising concerns the Pakistani Taliban are regrouping in the areas.

The Pakistani Taliban are a separate group but allies of the Afghan Taliban, who seized power in Afghanistan a year ago as the U.S. and NATO troops were in the final stages of their pullout.

The Taliban takeover in Afghanistan has emboldened the Pakistani Taliban to intensify their demands for stricter enforcement of Islamic laws in Pakistan, release of their members from government custody, and a reduction of military presence in Pakistan’s former tribal regions."

NAIROBI, Kenya -- Fewer Kenyans voted Tuesday in an unusual presidential election where a longtime opposition leader who is backed by the outgoing president faces the brash deputy president who styles himself as the outsider. Turnout was just 56% an hour before polls closed as some voters cited little hope of real change.

The election was considered close but calm. East Africa’s economic hub could see a presidential runoff for the first time. Economic issues such as widespread corruption could be of greater importance than the ethnic tensions that have marked past votes with sometimes deadly results.

Kenya is a standout with its relatively democratic system in a region where some leaders are notorious for clinging to power for decades. Its stability is crucial for foreign investors, the most humble of street vendors and troubled neighbors like Ethiopia and Somalia.

The top candidates are Raila Odinga, a democracy campaigner who has vied for the presidency for a quarter-century, and 55-year-old Deputy President William Ruto, who has stressed his journey from a humble childhood to appeal to struggling Kenyans long accustomed to political dynasties.

“In moments like this is when the mighty and the powerful come to the realization that it is the simple and the ordinary that eventually make the choice,” Ruto told journalists. “I look forward to our victorious day.” He urged Kenyans to be peaceful and respect others' choices.

“I have confidence that the people of Kenya are going to speak loudly in favor of democratic change,” Odinga told journalists. A cheering crowd jogged alongside his convoy as he arrived to vote in Nairobi.

To win outright, a candidate needs more than half of all votes and at least 25% of the votes in more than half of Kenya’s 47 counties. No outright winner means a runoff election within 30 days. Attention turned Tuesday night to classrooms and other vote-counting locations across the country as paper ballots were inspected one by one.

Results must be announced within a week, but impatience is expected if they don’t come before this weekend. “What we want to try to avoid is a long period of anxiety, of suspense,” said Bruce Golding, who leads the Commonwealth election observer group.

Outgoing President Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Kenya’s first president, cut across the usual ethnic lines and angered Ruto by backing longtime rival Odinga after their bitter 2017 election contest. But both Odinga and Ruto have chosen running mates from the country’s largest ethnic group, the Kikuyu.

The 77-year-old Odinga made history by choosing running mate Martha Karua, a former justice minister and the first woman to be a leading contender for the deputy presidency. She has inspired many women in a country where female candidates commonly face harassment.

Rising food and fuel prices, debt at 67% of GDP, youth unemployment at 40% and corruption put economic issues at the center of an election in which unregulated campaign spending highlighted the country’s inequality. But personalities still matter.

“We need mature people to lead, not someone who abuses people. Someone who respects elders,” said 55-year-old teacher Rosemary Mulima, who arrived at a polling station on Nairobi's outskirts to find about 500 people in line before dawn. She had “very high” hopes for Odinga on his fifth try,

The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission estimated that final turnout would be above 60%, far lower than the 80% in the 2017 election. That would make it Kenya's lowest turnout in 15 or even 20 years. The electoral commission signed up less than half of the new voters it had hoped for, just 2.5 million.

More than 6.5 million people had voted by midday, or about 30% of the 22 million registered.

“The problems from (the previous election), the economy, the day-to-day life, are still here,” said 38-year-old shopkeeper Adrian Kibera. “We don't have good choices,” he said, calling Odinga too old and Ruto too inexperienced.

Difficulties were reported at times with the electronic voting system, and presidential candidate George Wajackoyah told journalists that some voting kits in his stronghold weren’t working. Though polling in low single figures, Wajackoyah and his pledges to legalize marijuana prompted questions over whether he could draw enough votes to force a runoff.

The electoral commission said about 200 voting kits had failed out of more than 46,000, calling it “not widespread"" and “normal” for technology to break down at times.

Kenyans hope for a peaceful vote. Elections can be exceptionally troubled, as in 2007 when the country exploded after Odinga claimed the vote had been stolen from him and more than 1,000 people were killed. Ruto was indicted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity for his role in the violence, but his case was terminated amid allegations of witness tampering.

In 2017, the high court overturned the election results, a first in Africa, after Odinga challenged them over irregularities. He boycotted the new vote and proclaimed himself the “people’s president,” bringing allegations of treason. A public handshake between him and Kenyatta calmed the crisis.

This is likely Odinga’s last try. Ruto and Odinga have said they will accept the official results — if the vote is free and fair. “It is every Kenyan's hope,"" the president told journalists."

BEIJING -- The top South Korean and Chinese diplomats pledged Thursday to develop closer relations and maintain stable industrial supply chains at a time of deepening rivalry between Beijing and Washington.

South Korea, a longtime U.S. ally, is struggling to strike a balance between Washington and the increasingly assertive foreign policy of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government. U.S.-Chinese conflict over Taiwan has added to complications for governments that want amicable ties with both sides.

Foreign Ministers Park Jin and Wang Yi, in separate statements, called for the development of relations based on successful three-decade-old commercial ties. They were meeting in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao.

Park and Wang gave no indication they discussed tensions over last week's visit by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of the U.S. House of Representatives to self-ruled Taiwan, which the mainland's ruling Communist Party claims as its own territory. Beijing retaliated by conducting military drills to intimidate the island and called off dialogue with Washington on climate change and other issues.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who took office in March, wants to improve security ties with Washington and Japan in response to North Korean nuclear threats. China, North Korea’s main ally, sees Japan as a strategic rival but also is South Korea’s biggest export market.

Pelosi visited South Korea last week, but Yoon, who was on vacation, talked to her by phone instead of face to face. His critics accused him of avoiding seeing her to protect relations with China.

Park and Wang called for maintaining stable industry supply chains, a possible reference to fears that Chinese technology policy and U.S. security controls might split the world into separate markets with incompatible standards and products, slowing innovation and raising costs.

Park expressed hope the two sides will increase cooperation based on “universal values and standards.” He said they should overcome new challenges posed by a “great transition in international society” but gave no details.

Park appealed to Beijing to help persuade North Korea to return to talks on its nuclear weapons program, which he called an “unprecedented threat” to peace on the Korean Peninsula.

Wang’s statement didn’t mention the nuclear issue and gave no indication whether he said what Beijing might do. The South Korean Foreign Ministry declined to say what Wang told Park.

Park also expressed hope that Xi, the Chinese leader, would visit South Korea."

COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- The leaders of Estonia and Finland want fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take vacations in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine.

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas wrote Tuesday on Twitter that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right” and that it is “time to end tourism from Russia now.”

A day earlier, her counterpart in Finland, Sanna Marin, told Finnish broadcaster YLE that “it is not right that while Russia is waging an aggressive, brutal war of aggression in Europe, Russians can live a normal life, travel in Europe, be tourists.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy went further in a Washington Post interview Monday, saying all Western countries should ban Russian tourists.

Estonia and Finland both border Russia and are members of the European Union, which banned air travel from Russia after it invaded Ukraine. But Russians can still travel by land to both countries and apparently are then taking flights to other European destinations.

The calls for a travel ban have sparked outrage within Russia, from both the Kremlin and its critics. Opposition-minded public figures condemned the comments in social media posts as fueling Moscow’s anti-Western propaganda and being unhelpful in stopping the war.

“I think that over time, common sense will somehow manifest itself, and those who made such statements will come to their senses,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday.

YLE reported last week that Russian companies have started offering car trips from St. Petersburg to the airports of Helsinki and Lappeenranta in Finland, which have direct connections to several places in Europe. Russia’s second-largest city is about 300 kilometers (186 miles) from the Finnish capital.

Visas issued by Finland are valid across most of Europe's travel zone, known as the “Schengen area” which is made up of 26 countries: 22 EU nations plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Normally, people and goods move freely between these countries without border checks. Nineteen other countries outside this travel area allow in foreigners using a Schengen visa.

Finland just resumed accepting applications for tourist visas in Russia on July 1, lifting monthslong travel restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some EU countries no longer issue visas to Russians, including Latvia, which made that decision this month because of the war.

The visa issue is expected be discussed at an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers on Aug. 31, YLE reported.

“I would believe that in future European Council meetings, this issue will come up even more strongly. My personal position is that tourism should be restricted,” Marin told the Finnish broadcaster.

Peskov on Tuesday said calls for travel bans are usually coming from countries that Moscow has already deemed “hostile” and “many of those countries in their hostility sink into oblivion.”

Putin’s close associate and deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, dismissed the Estonian premier's statement, adding ominously: “I just want to remind her of another saying: ‘The fact that you are free is not your merit, but our flaw.'”

Zelenskyy told The Washington Post that “the most important sanctions are to close the borders” for Russian travelers, “because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land.”

Russians should “live in their own world until they change their philosophy,” Zelenskyy said, adding that such restrictions should apply to all Russians, even those who left the country and oppose the war.

It's contrasts with what he said in March, a month after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine, when he urged Russians to leave the country to avoid funding the war with their taxes.

Asked about Zelenskyy’s remarks, Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, called them a “statement ... that speaks for itself,” which Moscow views “extremely negatively.”

WASHINGTON -- Rosie Torres of Robstown, Texas, is no Washington lobbyist, but she’s been making the long trek to Capitol Hill for some 13 years, knocking year after year on lawmakers’ doors. Her mission: Alert them — convince them — that something awful has been happening to Iraq and Afghanistan veterans as a result of constant exposure to toxic military burn pits.

Torres’ husband, Le Roy, suffers from constrictive bronchitis, a respiratory condition that narrowed his airways and made breathing difficult. Rosie is sure it’s from his exposure to burn pits on his base in Iraq. But last week, even with the Senate just hours away from boosting health and disability benefits for veterans like her husband, she still wasn’t sure she had won over lawmakers, despite earlier votes indicating the bill was on the right track.

“It was still too good to be true,” Torres said. “Even when my senators voted, I said, ‘Something is up.'”

Torres was among the veterans and family members camped out at the Capitol last week, refusing to leave until the Senate passed the bill by a final vote of 86-11. That vote, lopsided at the last, was a momentous victory for a movement that has been years in the making but gained serious traction only during the current Congress.

President Joe Biden is scheduled to sign the bill into law on Wednesday.

The White House ceremony culminates an effort that began with the vets themselves and their harrowing stories, eventually amplified for public attention by comedian-activist Jon Stewart and personally embraced by the president, who has voiced his suspicion that burn pits led to his elder son’s death.

In the end, the bill received unanimous support from Democrats and a majority of Republicans despite its hefty price tag, estimated at roughly $280 billion over 10 years.

‘LET'S FULL-THROTTLE AND GET THIS GOING'

Another Texan, former Marine Tim Jensen, who served in Iraq in 2004 and 2005, was also part of the gathering outside the Capitol last week. He said he lost his best friend, Sgt. Frank Hazelwood, to lung cancer, and two other battalion colleagues to illnesses he attributes to serving near burn pits.

“They were all cancers of the brain and the lungs, and these were not cancers typical of that age group,” Jensen said.

He got actively involved some four years ago after a phone call with Torres, who had started an advocacy organization with her husband — Burn Pits 360. The organization serves as a clearinghouse for grim stories related by veterans and their families about the impact they believe burn pits have had on their lives.

What are these burn pits? Big, smelly and nothing anyone would want to breathe, they were commonly used by the military until several years ago to dispose of such things as chemicals, tires, plastics and medical and human waste.

Former Marine Jensen said a pivotal moment in the quest for federal help occurred when Stewart joined the effort, bringing the publicity that comes with celebrity attention.

“Rosie Torres and Burn Pits 360 have been working on this for over 10 years and they were getting very little traction,"" Jensen said. ""They needed some bigger push, right, to get it into a national conversation.”

Then the White House invited Danielle Robinson, the widow of Sgt. 1st Class Heath Robinson of Ohio, to attend Biden’s State of the Union address in March. During the address, Biden raised the possibility that being near burn pits led to the death of his son Beau.

“We don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops,” Biden said in the speech. “But I’m committed to finding out everything we can.”

Jensen said, “That’s when we knew we now have the attention and let’s full-throttle and get this thing going.""

“That certainly energized Democrats in the Senate and the House to move,” said Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.

On the House side, Rep. Mark Takano, chairman of that chamber’s Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, announced in early 2021 that helping veterans who experienced toxic exposure would be one of the panel's priorities for the coming Congress. That was not long after Biden had taken the oath of office.

Takano, a California Democrat, recalled on the House floor last month how he briefed the president. He said Biden leaned over and started talking about Beau, who died from brain cancer at age 46. He had served in Iraq for about a year in 2008 and 2009.

“It was during that meeting when I knew I had a partner in President Biden,"" Takano said.

The congressman was intent on avoiding a piecemeal approach. He didn't want the legislation to pit vets from one war against those of another in a fight for limited Department of Veterans Affairs resources.

The bill not only expands health and disability benefits for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans but contains provisions to aid more Vietnam-era vets exposed to Agent Orange. It also provides support to veterans exposed to water contamination at North Carolina’s Camp LeJeune and to radiation in Palomares, Spain, site of one of the largest nuclear disasters in history, and Enewetak Atoll of the Marshall Islands, where the U.S. conducted numerous nuclear tests.

The House passed the first iteration of the bill in March. The vote was 256-174 with most Republicans opposing. They cited costs and the strain it would cause on a VA already struggling to meet current workloads.

‘DO YOUR DUTY AND PASS THIS’

A few weeks after the House vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., joined Stewart, veterans advocates and Danielle Robinson for a news conference in which she described what it was like being with her husband, for whom the bill is named, in his final moments as he died from lung cancer.

“I ask you to do your duty and pass this,” she implored.

Schumer promised the bill would get a vote in the Senate. “Everyone is going to have to show where they stand, and whose side they are on,” he said.

The Senate was at work on its own version of the bill. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, said the veterans groups were clear that the bill was the panel's No. 1 priority.

Tester had cooperative partners in Moran and Republican John Boozman of Arkansas, with their discussions focused on making sure the VA would be ready for the workload.

“We were talking with the VA. ... Are we setting you up for failure? Is this something you can deliver on?” Tester said. “And they assured us they could. There were a few changes we had to make and we made them.”

Those changes included staggering the start for some of the benefit enhancements and providing more flexibility for hiring staff. The changes also helped trim tens of billions of dollars in spending from the House version, giving more Republicans reason to support the final product once it went back to the House.

The slightly trimmed bill ended up passing both chambers with significant bipartisan support. But then lawmakers discovered it contained a revenue-related provision that had to originate in the House, requiring a do-over for a technical fix.

That’s normally a formality, but the do-over was complicated when Republicans unexpectedly blocked the burn pits bill from advancing last month. That was shortly after Schumer announced he had reached agreement with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., on a party-line health and climate package paid for in part with higher taxes on corporations. Republicans were angry about that. Veterans were angry, too, that their burn pits bill was blocked, some felt, in retaliation.

Many would spend the next days camped out at the Capitol, taking shifts in Washington’s oppressive humidity and thunderstorms. They got a celebratory ending last week when the Senate passed the measure after giving Republicans a chance to vote on amendments, all defeated.

The family of Gabby Petito announced Monday they plan to file a wrongful death lawsuit against the police department in Moab, Utah, where Petito and her boyfriend Brian Laundrie were questioned last year about a possible domestic dispute.

Shortly after Petito and Laundrie were questioned by police on Aug. 12, 2021, Petito, 22, went missing.

Petito's body was discovered last September in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming. Laundrie, who was later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park in North Port, Florida, wrote in a notebook that he killed her, according to the FBI.

In a press release announcing the lawsuit, an attorney for the Petito family, Brian Stewart, said officers from the Moab City Police Department ""failed to properly investigate the reported domestic assault, and thus failed to fully appreciate or respond to Gabby's life-threatening situation.""

""While the full evidence has not yet been made public, when it is released, it will clearly show that if the officers had been properly trained and followed the law, Gabby would still be alive today,"" James McConkie, another of the family's attorneys, said in the press release. ""Failure to follow the law can have deadly consequences, as it did in this case.""

In a notice of claim sent on Aug. 5, attorneys representing Joseph and Tara Petito and Nichole and Jim Schmidt said they are seeking $50 million in damages.

Body camera images from the Aug. 12 incident show Petito and Laundrie talking to an officer after her 2012 Ford Transit was pulled over by Moab police. In one image, she appears to be crying while sitting in the back of a police vehicle.

The couple told police they were arguing and that Petito had slapped Laundrie, according to the police report. The couple also stated to police that Laundrie did not hit Petito.

In a statement at the time, Moab police said that ""insufficient evidence existed to justify criminal charges"" in that incident.

Petito had told police she suffered from severe anxiety and other medical conditions, which were redacted from the police report, and that the couple's argument had been building for days. Police labeled the incident as a ""mental/emotional break"" rather than a domestic assault, according to the police report.

The incident took place about two weeks before Petito, who was on a cross-country trip with Laundrie, last spoke with her family, who reported her missing on Sept. 11.

Officials confirmed on Sept. 21 that a body found in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming was Petito. A coroner later ruled that she had died of ""blunt-force injuries to the head and neck, with manual strangulation.""

Laundrie returned to his parent's home in North Port without Petito and was reported missing on Sept. 17.

Police found Laundrie's remains in Carlton Reserve several weeks later, in October.

Shortly after Petito's body was found, the city of Moab announced it would launch an independent investigation into its police department's handling of the incident involving Petito and Laundrie.

In January, the independent report said it found police made ""several unintentional mistakes"" responding to the incident, including not issuing a domestic violence citation to Petito after she claimed she hit her boyfriend first, and not taking a statement from a 911 caller who had reported seeing a man slapping a girl, according to the Associated Press.

""Would Gabby be alive today if this case was handled differently? That is an impossible question to answer despite it being the answer many people want to know,"" Capt. Brandon Ratcliffe, the Price, Utah, police officer who led the investigation, wrote in the report. ""Nobody knows and nobody will ever know the answer to that question.""

In response to the report's findings, the city of Moab said it planned to implement recommendations including providing additional training in domestic violence investigation and strengthening the review process for incident reports.

""As the Moab City Police Department continues its daily mission to serve our community, efforts are underway to provide additional resources and tools to assist them in addressing domestic violence incidents,"" the city said in a statement. ""Plans are in place to add a trained domestic violence specialist to oversee incidents investigated by Moab officers. We also will implement added and ongoing training and testing to ensure that the officers understand policies and procedures.""

The city also applauded the responding officers, writing, ""Based on the report's findings, the City of Moab believes our officers showed kindness, respect and empathy in their handling of this incident.""

The city declined to comment on the announcement of the wrongful death lawsuit.

Stewart, an attorney for Petito's family, said they hope their planned lawsuit helps to ""prevent such tragedies"" as Petito's death.

""The Petito family believes that it is important as a society to hold our governmental institutions to account for such failures and to work toward changes to protect victims of domestic abuse and violence and prevent such tragedies in the future,"" Stewart said in a statement.

Brianna Grier, the Georgia woman who died after falling out of a police car last month, died from a severe blunt force injury to the head, according to the preliminary findings of an independent autopsy ordered by her family.

""In this case, the cause of death is consistent with the severe blunt force injury that occurred inside of the head,"" Dr. Allecia Wilson, a pathologist and the director of autopsy and forensic services at the University of Michigan, said at a press conference Monday to announce the findings.

Grier's medical records from Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta showed she had two fractures, hemorrhaging and a subdural hematoma after falling out of a moving police car while handcuffed on July 15, according to Wilson.

The 28-year-old mother of two was arrested by Hancock County Sheriff's Office deputies Lt. Marlin Primus and Timothy Legette on July 15 after Grier's mother called 911 to report that her daughter was experiencing a mental health crisis. According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Grier fell out of the car's rear passenger door after it was not closed prior to transporting her to the sheriff's office. She had been handcuffed in front of her body and was not wearing a seatbelt.

The results of an official autopsy being conducted as part of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's review of Grier's death are still pending.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation told ABC News it did not have any investigation updates or comments to share at this time.

The 10-minute clip shows officers struggling to get Grier into the backseat of the police car, but does not show how she ended up falling out of the vehicle.

""To put a handcuffed person in the back of a police car unrestrained ... you can use your own common sense as to what likely happened, especially when we look at the pathology from the MRI reports about the violent trauma -- the severe trauma and severe blunt force trauma -- that caused her to be knocked into a coma and to succumb six days later,"" attorney Ben Crump said Monday.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli troops killed three Palestinian militants and wounded dozens in a shootout that erupted during an arrest raid in the city of Nablus in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday.

The shootout came a day after a cease-fire ended three days of fighting between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group in the Gaza Strip.

In a separate incident in the West Bank city of Hebron, the Palestinian Health Ministry said a 17-year-old was killed by Israeli fire. The Israeli military said forces were responding with live fire, among other means, to a violent protest.

Israeli police said security forces encircled the home of Ibrahim al-Nabulsi, who they say was wanted for a string of shootings in the West Bank earlier this year. They confirmed that al-Nabulsi and another Palestinian militant were killed in a shootout at the scene, and that troops found arms and explosives in his home.

The Israeli military said that troops came under attack from Palestinians throwing rocks and explosives, and that soldiers responded with live fire. It confirmed Palestinians were shot, but did not elaborate on their condition.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said three people were killed — al-Nabulsi, Islam Sabouh and Hussein Jamal Taha — and at least 40 were wounded.

The armed wing of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah party, the Al-Aqsa Martyr’s Brigade, later claimed the three as its members and vowed retaliation. The Fatah party said the organization “mourns its martyred sons” and said the three had “sacrificed their lives in defense of our great people and their right to freedom and independence.”

Israel has conducted near nightly arrest raids in the West Bank in recent months as part of a crackdown on Palestinian militant groups, foremost Islamic Jihad, in the aftermath of a string of deadly attacks targeting Israelis earlier this year that left 19 people dead. Dozens of Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops during these arrest raids.

Last week, Israel arrested Bassam al-Saadi, a senior Islamic Jihad militant in the West Bank city of Jenin, during one of the nightly operations. The group said it was going “on alert,” and on Friday, Israel launched a series of strikes on Islamic Jihad targets in the Gaza Strip in what it said was a response to an “imminent threat” by the militant group.

During the three days of Gaza fighting, at least 46 Palestinians were killed, including 16 children and four women, and 311 were wounded, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. Twelve of those killed were Islamic Jihad militants, one was from a smaller armed group, and two were Hamas-affiliated policemen who were not taking part in the fighting, according to the armed factions.

Israel estimated that a total of 47 Palestinians were killed, including 14 killed by misfired Islamic Jihad rockets. It said 20 militants and seven civilians died in Israeli airstrikes and that it was still investigating six deaths.

Israel’s caretaker prime minister, Yair Lapid, applauded the cooperation by Israeli security personnel and said that al-Nabulsi’s killing “was another step in our uncompromising struggle against terrorism.”

Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for Abbas, warned that continued violence could further ignite the region, and accused the Israeli government of shedding Palestinian blood to secure internal political capital ahead of November parliamentary elections.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric, asked about the killings Tuesday, said: “We’re, obviously, very concerned about the increased violence that we’ve seen in the occupied West Bank, including the killing today of three Palestinians in Nablus and one in Hebron following clashes with Israeli security forces.”

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “calls on all sides to demonstrate calm and calls on the relevant authorities to carry out independent, transparent investigations into all deaths and injuries,” Dujarric said.

Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians seek it as the heartland of their future state. Israel views the West Bank as the biblical and historical heartland of the Jewish people, and has constructed dozens of settlements, now home to over 400,000 Israelis.

The Palestinians and much of the international community consider Israel’s West Bank settlements a violation of international law and an obstacle to a peaceful resolution of the decades-long conflict.

If they find any Ukrainian symbols or any link to the Ukrainian military, they put all family members in a filtration camp,” Fedorov said.
The resistance ranges from radical activists to teachers and retirees who sing Ukrainian songs in parks and secretly wear yellow and blue ribbons.","Guerrilla forces loyal to Kyiv are killing pro-Moscow officials in a growing challenge to Russia’s grip on areas it occupies in southeastern Ukraine

KYIV, Ukraine -- In a growing challenge to Russia's grip on occupied areas of southeastern Ukraine, guerrilla forces loyal to Kyiv are killing pro-Moscow officials, blowing up bridges and trains, and helping the Ukrainian military by identifying key targets.

The spreading resistance has eroded Kremlin control of those areas and threatened its plans to hold referendums in various cities as a move toward annexation by Russia.

“Our goal is to make life unbearable for the Russian occupiers and use any means to derail their plans,” said Andriy, a 32-year-old coordinator of the guerrilla movement in the southern Kherson region.

A member of the Zhovta Strichka — or “Yellow Ribbon” — resistance group, Andriy spoke to The Associated Press on condition of not being fully identified to avoid being tracked down by the Russians. The group takes its name from one of the two national colors of Ukraine, and its members use ribbons of that hue to mark potential targets for guerrilla attacks.

Ukrainian troops recently used a U.S.-supplied multiple rocket launcher known as HIMARS to hit a strategic bridge on the Dnieper River in Kherson, severing the Russians' main supply link. The city of 500,000 people, seized by Russian troops early in the war, has been flooded with leaflets from the resistance, threatening Moscow-backed officials.

Just before the bridge attack, leaflets appeared, saying, “If HIMARS can’t do it, a partisan will help.”

“We are giving the Ukrainian military precise coordinates for various targets, and the guerrillas' assistance makes the new long-range weapons, particularly HIMARS, even more powerful,” Andriy told the AP. “We are invisible behind the Russian lines, and this is our strength.”

As Ukrainian forces step up attacks in the region and reclaim some areas west of the Dnieper River, the guerrilla activity also has increased.

They coordinate with the Ukrainian military's Special Operations Forces, which helps them develop strategies and tactics. Those forces also select targets and set up a website with tips on how to organize resistance, prepare ambushes and elude arrest. A network of weapons caches and secret hideouts was established in occupied areas.

Bombs have been placed near administrative buildings, at officials' homes and even on their routes to work.

An explosive placed on a tree went off as a vehicle carrying Kherson prison chief Yevgeny Sobolev passed by, although he survived the attack. A police vehicle was hit by a shrapnel bomb, seriously wounding two officers, one of whom later died. The deputy head of the local administration in Nova Kakhovka died of wounds after being gunned down over the weekend.

Guerrillas have repeatedly tried to kill Vladimir Saldo, the head of the Kherson region's Russia-backed temporary administration, offering a bounty of 1 million hryvnias (about $25,000). His assistant, Pavel Slobodchikov, was shot and killed in his vehicle, and another official, Dmytry Savluchenko, was killed by a car bomb.

The attacks have prompted Moscow to send anti-guerrilla units to Kherson, Saldo said.

“Every day, special units from Russia detect two or three caches with weapons for terrorist activities,” Saldo said on his messaging app channel. “The seizure of weapons help reduce the threat of sabotage.”

Early in the occupation, thousands of residents staged peaceful protests. But the Russian military quickly disbanded them and arrested activists, radicalizing the resistance.

Wedding photographer-turned-activist Oleksandr Kharchikov, 41, of Skadovsk, said he was beaten and tortured after being arrested in a Russian security sweep.

“The Russians tortured me for a long time. They beat me with a baseball bat, they pinched my fingers with pliers and tortured me with electric shocks,” Kharchikov said in a telephone interview. “I suffered a concussion and a broken rib, but I didn't give them any information, and that saved me.”

Kharchikov spent 155 days under Russian occupation until he escaped.

“The repressions are intensifying. They are creating unbearable conditions for the Ukrainians, making it increasingly difficult to survive under Russian occupation,” he told the AP.

The Russians were offering 10,000 rubles ($165) to anyone applying for Russian citizenship to strengthen their grip on the region, he said.

Moscow has introduced the ruble, set up Russian cellular networks and cut off Ukrainian television in the area. Giant screens showing Russian TV broadcasts have been placed on the main squares of cities.

Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov, who also spent a long time in Russian captivity, told the AP that about 500 Ukrainian activists were detained, with many tortured. Some vanished for months after their arrest.

In May and June, guerrillas blew up two railway bridges in Melitopol and derailed two Russian military trains, Fedorov said.

“The resistance movement is pursuing three goals -- to destroy Russian weapons and means of supplying them, discrediting and intimidating the occupiers and their collaborators, and informing Ukrainian special services about enemy positions,” he added.

Russia responded by bolstering patrols and conducting regular sweeps for those suspected of guerrilla links. During such raids, they check phones and arrest those with Ukrainian symbols or photos of relatives in military uniforms.

“In a mopping-up operation, the Russians seal the entire neighborhood, halt traffic to and from it, and methodically go from one apartment to another. If they find any Ukrainian symbols or any link to the Ukrainian military, they put all family members in a filtration camp,” Fedorov said.

“In the best case, people are told: ‘Get out of here if you are against Russia,’ but it also happens that some people disappear,” he said.

Of Melitopol’s prewar population of 150,000, more than 60,000 people have left.

Pro-Moscow officials are preparing for a possible referendum on Melitopol and other occupied areas joining Russia, conducting security raids and handing out Russian passports, Fedorov said.

“We will thwart the Russian referendum. We won't allow voting under Russian gun barrels,” he said, adding that no more than 10% of the population sympathizes with Moscow, and half has fled.

Guerrillas have tied yellow ribbons on buildings where voting is to be held, warning residents that they could be targeted by bombs during balloting.

The resistance ranges from radical activists to teachers and retirees who sing Ukrainian songs in parks and secretly wear yellow and blue ribbons.

“The Russians were expecting that they would be met with flowers, but they faced the fact that most people consider themselves Ukrainians and are ready to offer resistance in various forms — from collecting information to burning and blowing up the occupiers,” said Oleksii Aleksandrov, who owned a restaurant in the southern port of Mariupol.

In one recent gesture of defiance in Mariupol, a young man wrapped in a Ukrainian flag stood on a street next to the theater destroyed by Russian bombs. The photo spread through Ukrainian media, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed him in an address to the nation.

“It was a very brave thing to do, and I would like to thank him for his action,” Zelenskyy said. “This man is one of many people who are waiting for Ukraine's comeback and won't accept the occupation under any circumstances.”

Although pro-Moscow sentiment is strong in Ukraine's mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland of the Donbas, a guerrilla movement also has emerged there.

Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said six Russian troops were wounded last month when their vehicle was blown up by guerrillas in the city of Sievierodonetsk soon after its seizure. They also have targeted railways, disrupting Russian munitions shipments and other supplies.

“The guerrillas have acted quite successfully,” Haidai told the AP. “They haven't only spread leaflets. They also have destroyed infrastructure facilities. It helps a lot to slow down the Russian attacks and advances.”

Observers say the guerrilla movement varies by region and that it is in the interest of both sides to exaggerate its scope.

“The Russians do it to justify their repressions on the occupied territories while the Ukrainians seek to demoralize the Russian forces and extol their victories,” said Vadim Karasev, head of the Kyiv-based Institute of Global Strategies think tank. “It's hard to believe the tales about Ukrainians feeding Russian soldiers with poisoned cakes, but sometimes myths work better than facts.”

If the metals requirement isn't met, the automaker and its buyers would be eligible for half the tax credit, $3,750.
The tax credit would be available only to couples with incomes of $300,000 or less or single people with income of $150,000 or less.
He told reporters last week that he wants automakers to “get aggressive and make sure that we’re extracting in North America, we’re processing in North America and we put a line on China.","A tax credit of up to $7,500 could be used to defray the cost of an electric vehicle under the Inflation Reduction Act now moving toward final approval in Congress

DETROIT -- A tax credit of up to $7,500 could be used to defray the cost of an electric vehicle under the Inflation Reduction Act now moving toward final approval in Congress.

But the auto industry is warning that the vast majority of EV purchases won’t qualify for a tax credit that large.

That's mainly because of the bill's requirement that, to qualify for the credit, an electric vehicle must contain a battery built in North America with minerals mined or recycled on the continent.

And those rules become more stringent over time — to the point where, in a few years, it's possible that no EVs would qualify for the tax credit, says John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance of Automotive Innovation, a key industry trade group. As of now, the alliance estimates that about 50 of the 72 electric, hydrogen or plug-in hybrid models that are sold in the United States wouldn't meet the requirements.

“The $7,500 credit might exist on paper,"" Bozzella said in a statement, “but no vehicles will qualify for this purchase over the next few years.”

The idea behind the requirement is to incentivize domestic manufacturing and mining, build a robust battery supply chain in North America and lessen the industry's dependence on overseas supply chains that could be subject to disruptions.

Production of lithium and other minerals that are used to produce EV batteries is now dominated by China. And the world's leading producer of cobalt, another component of the EV batteries, is the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Though electric vehicles are part of a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they require metallic elements known as rare earths, found in places like Myanmar, where an Associated Press investigation has found that the push for green energy has led to environmental destruction.

Under the $740 billion economic package, which passed the Senate over the weekend and is nearing approval in the House, the tax credits would take effect next year. For an EV buyer to qualify for the full credit, 40% of the metals used in a vehicle's battery must come from North America. By 2027, that required threshold would reach 80%.

If the metals requirement isn't met, the automaker and its buyers would be eligible for half the tax credit, $3,750.

A separate rule would require that half the batteries' value must be manufactured or assembled in the North America. If not, the rest of the tax credit would be lost. Those requirements also grow stricter each year, eventually reaching 100% in 2029. Still another rule would require that the EV itself be manufactured in North America, thereby excluding from the tax credit any vehicles made overseas.

Automakers generally don’t release where their components come from or how much they cost. But it’s likely that some versions of Tesla’s Model Y SUV and Model 3 car, the Chevrolet Bolt car and SUV and the Ford Mustang Mach E would be eligible for at least part of the credit. All those vehicles are assembled in North America.

The tax credit would be available only to couples with incomes of $300,000 or less or single people with income of $150,000 or less. And any trucks or SUVs with sticker prices above $80,000 or cars above $55,000 wouldn't be eligible.

There’s also a new $4,000 credit for buyers of used EVs, a provision that could help modest-income households go electric.

The industry says the North American battery supply chain is too small right now to meet the battery component requirements. It has proposed that the measure expand the list of countries whose battery materials would be eligible for the tax credit to nations that maintain defense agreements with the United States, including NATO members.

One component of the bill would require that after 2024, no vehicle would be eligible for the tax credit if its battery components came from China. Most vehicles now have some parts sourced in China, the alliance said.

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat and a leading ally of Detroit automakers, complained that Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a critical Democratic vote, had opposed any tax credits for EV purchases.

“I went round-and-round with Senator Manchin, who frankly didn’t support any credit of any kind, so this is a compromise,” Stabenow told reporters Monday. “We’ll work through it and make this as good as we can for our automakers.”

Manchin, long a holdout Democrat who negotiated terms of the deal with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, had blocked previous climate and social spending proposals.

Manchin's office declined to comment. He told reporters last week that he wants automakers to “get aggressive and make sure that we’re extracting in North America, we’re processing in North America and we put a line on China. I don’t believe that we should be building a transportation mode on the backs of foreign supply chains. I’m not going to do it.”

Stabenow asserted that the bill was written by people who don't understand that manufacturers can't simply flip a switch and create a North American supply chain, though they are working on it. Numerous automakers, including General Motors, Ford, Stellantis, Toyota and Hyundai-Kia, have announced plans to build EV battery plants in the United States.

Katie Sweeney, executive vice president of the National Mining Association, said that industry leaders “like the requirement that minerals for batteries be sourced close to home rather than from our geopolitical rivals.”

“Doing that,” she said, ""directly supports high-paying jobs here in the United States ... secures our supply chain and really enhances our global competitiveness.”

Stabenow said she remains hopeful that the Biden administration can offer the tax credits next year while it works on the detailed rules for the battery requirements.

“We will continue to work with the automakers and the administration on getting as much common sense into the regulations as possible,” the senator said.

Messages were left Monday seeking comment from the White House and the Treasury Department, which would administer the credits.

Stabenow says she's pleased that the measure would restore tax credits for General Motors, Tesla and Toyota, all of which hit caps under a previous bill and can no longer offer them. Ford, too, she said, is closing in on an EV cap.

BUTHA-BUTHE, Lesotho -- While millions across Europe sweat through a summer of record-breaking heat, others are skiing in Africa.

Don't worry. This isn't another sign of climate change but rather the fascinating anomaly of Lesotho, a tiny mountain kingdom completely surrounded by South Africa. Lesotho has a geographical claim to fame: It's the only country on Earth where every inch of its territory sits more than 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) above sea level.

That gives Lesotho snow in the southern hemisphere's winters. And while cold winters aren't rare in southern Africa, snow is and ski resorts are even rarer. At an altitude of 3,000 meters (9,842 feet), Afriski in Lesotho's Maluti Mountains is Africa's only operating ski resort south of the equator.

“I've never seen snow in my life,” said Kafi Mojapelo, who traveled the short distance from South Africa for a skiing vacation she never thought she'd take. “So, this is a great experience.”

Bafana Nadida, who comes from the sprawling urban township of Soweto in Johannesburg, was delighted with putting ski boots on for the first time. He planned a day of ski lessons, taking pictures and just playing about in the snow.

Skiers and snowboarders lined up to rent the proper gear. Some were given pointers by Hope Ramokotjo, who is from Lesotho and has worked as a self-taught ski and snowboard instructor for 12 years. His wide smile and deep, reassuring voice put beginners at ease.

“Push your heels out. Don’t pull your shoulders,"" Ramokotjo called out to his class of keen yet inexperienced African skiers as they wobbled along on the snow. ""Here you go! Nice!”

Afriski's Kapoko Snow Park is the only freestyle snow park on the continent. Competitors lined up last month for the annual Winter Whip Slopestyle snowboard and ski competition. Sekholo Ramonotsi, a 13-year-old from the Lesotho city of Butha-Buthe who practices regularly at Afriski, won the junior snowboard and ski divisions.

“I would really like to ski in Europe,” he said.

London-born Meka Lebohang Ejindu said he has taught skiing and snowboarding in Austria for more than a decade and this is his first season in the southern hemisphere. He has family roots in Lesotho.

“For a competition like this to happen in southern Africa is so heartwarming,” he said.

Afriski may not be at the level of Europe's vast Alpine resorts but a love of winter sports is catching.

At Afriski's Sky Restaurant and Gondola Cafe, happy hour starts at 10 a.m. and skiers and boarders show off their winter fashions and party to house music, beers in hand. Some claim the bar is the highest in Africa, although that's challenged by the Sani Mountain Lodge, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the east on the Lesotho-South Africa border.

What no one can dispute is this crowd went skiing in Africa."

TOKYO -- Nagasaki paid tribute to the victims of the U.S. atomic bombing 77 years ago on Aug. 9, with the mayor saying Russia's war on Ukraine showed the world that another nuclear attack is not just a worry but “a tangible and present crisis.”

Mayor Tomihisa Taue, in his speech Tuesday at the Nagasaki Peace Park, said nuclear weapons can be used as long as they exist, and their elimination is the only way to save the future of humankind.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine and threat of nuclear weapons use came only a month after it and four other nuclear powers pledged in a statement that nuclear war should never be fought, Taue noted.

“This has shown the world that the use of nuclear weapons is not a groundless fear but a tangible and present crisis,” he said. The belief that nuclear weapons can be possessed not for actual use but for deterrence “is a fantasy, nothing more than a mere hope.""

As in Hiroshima, Russia and its ally Belarus were not invited to the memorial event in Nagasaki.

The United States dropped the world’s first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, destroying the city and killing 140,000 people. It dropped a second bomb three days later on Nagasaki, killing another 70,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, ending World War II and Japan’s nearly half-century of aggression in Asia.

Participants, including diplomats from nuclear states, observed a moment of silence at 11:02 a.m., the moment the bomb exploded above the southern Japanese city on Aug. 9, 1945.

Although Russia last week tried to roll back on Putin’s warning, fears of a third atomic bombing have grown amid Russia’s threats of nuclear attack since its war on Ukraine began in February. Russia last week shelled a Ukrainian city close to Europe's largest nuclear plant.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said, “Even though we face a severe security environment, we must pursue the history of non-nuclear use and make Nagasaki the last place of nuclear attack.”

Japanese officials worry that the conflict may embolden China to be even more assertive in East Asia, and the government is pushing to further step up its military capability and spending.

Japan renounces its own possession, production or hosting of nuclear weapons, but as a U.S. ally Japan hosts 50,000 American troops and is protected by the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Still, Russia's nuclear threat has prompted some hawkish lawmakers in the governing party have also proposed a possibility of nuclear sharing with the United States.

Taue said discussions about nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation over the past decades have not been put into practice and trust in the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has become “tenuous.”

“We must recognize that ridding ourselves of nuclear weapons is the only realistic way of protecting the Earth and humankind’s future,” Taue said.

Taue urged Japan's government to exercise leadership in pursuing peace diplomacy that does not rely on nuclear deterrence.

“Nuclear weapons are not deterrence,” said Takashi Miyata, an 82-year-old survivor, or hibakusha. He said possible nuclear sharing is “the opposite of our wish.""

Air-raid sirens and scenes of bombed-out Ukraine reminded him of the “pika don,” or the flash and explosion of the atomic bombing that Miyata experienced at age 5. His uncle and aunt died in the bombing, and his father died of leukemia five years later. Miyata also developed cancer 10 years ago.

Many survivors of the bombings have lasting injuries and illnesses resulting from the explosions and radiation exposure and have faced discrimination in Japan.

As of March, 118,935 survivors are certified as eligible for government medical support, according to the health and welfare ministry. Their average age now exceeds 84."

SYDNEY -- Australia’s most populous state took a major step toward banning Nazi symbols on Tuesday when the New South Wales Parliament’s lower house passed a bill that would criminalize their display.

The bill must pass the upper chamber to become law.

Victoria, Australia’s second-most populous state, in June became the first in Australia to pass a law banning the public display of Nazi swastikas.

Queensland and Tasmania states have foreshadowed similar laws, which would mean half Australia’s eight states and territories and most of the Australian population were banned from displaying Nazi symbols.

New South Wales Attorney General Mark Speakman told Parliament on Tuesday the Nazi swastika harmed and distressed community members, including those of the Jewish faith. In 2020, New South Wales Police received 31 reports of the display of Nazi flags, including one from a home near a Sydney synagogue.

“Hateful and vilifying conduct is completely unacceptable in our community,” Speakman said.

Using or displaying Nazi flags or Nazi memorabilia bearing swastikas would be banned under the law.

The legislation would allow the use of the symbol for religious and education purposes. The swastika for Buddhist, Hindu, Jain and other faith communities is an ancient and sacred symbol.

Individuals would face 12 months in prison or an 11,000 Australian dollar ($7,670) fine for breaking the laws, while corporations faced AU$55,000 ($38,350) fines.

In an amendment to the legislation, a review of the laws would need to be held within a 3 1/2-year after they come into effect.

The world needs to replace petroleum plastic with plastic materials that have been verified and certified as completely biodegradable, he said.
Narayan acknowledged that bioplastics are easier to biodegrade than petrochemical plastic which can take centuries to disintegrate, shedding worrisome microplastic along the way.","Billions of dollars in investments are pouring into companies changing the recipe for plastic

CLEVELAND -- In a world increasingly troubled by the persistent harm that plastic — manufactured in petrochemical plants — has had on the environment, companies are investing billions of dollars to ramp up production of plastics made from natural, renewable materials that can be safely composted or can biodegrade under the right conditions.

Bioplastics have long been used in medical applications. The stitches you got after cutting your hand slicing onions were likely made of a bioplastic thread that harmlessly dissolved into your body.

But the nascent bioplastics industry envisions a far bigger role for materials made from corn, sugar, vegetable oils and other renewable materials in the hope of grabbing a larger share of a nearly $600 billion global plastic market.

Since large-scale production began in the 1950s, fossil fuel plastics have made food safer to consume and vehicles safer to drive, for example. Yet plastics are seen as one of the world’s leading environmental threats with its production responsible for emitting million tons of greenhouse gases each year.

Of the 9 billion tons of fossil fuel plastic produced since the 1950s, only 9% percent has been recycled, studies have shown. The rest has been buried in landfills, burned or has polluted land and waterways. The chemical structure of fossil fuel plastic means it can never fully disintegrate and instead breaks down into smaller and smaller particles.

For now, bioplastic represents just 1% of global plastic production. If plastic made with fossil fuels is the enormous Mall of America in Minnesota, bioplastics would be a 7-Eleven.

Companies and investors see opportunities. Data from i3 Connect show investment in bioplastic manufacturing reached $500 million in the first three months of 2022, exceeding the previous high of $350 million in the last quarter of 2021. The money is coming in from both corporations and venture capitalists.

Zion Market Research estimates the bioplastics market will surge from $10.5 billion in 2021 to some $29 billion in 2028.

Danimer Scientific is one company making a big bet on bioplastic with a recent expansion of its plant in Winchester, Kentucky, The Georgia-based firm makes a bioplastic called PHA using microorganisms that ferment with canola oil. The result is plastic pellets that manufacturers can use to mold products in the same way they use petrochemical plastic, Danimer CEO Stephen Croskrey said in an interview.

The expansion has made Danimer one of the largest PHA producers in the world.

Straws and plastic drink stirrers made from Danimer's PHA are being used in Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts and large venues like Sofi Stadium in Inglewood, California, Croskrey said.

“We have active development projects for just about anything you can imagine,” he said.

Testing has shown products made from Danimer’s PHA can biodegrade in six months in marine environments and two years in soil, Croskrey said.

The other primary bioplastic sold today is PLA, polylactic acid, usually produced by fermenting sugar from corn and sugar cane. One producer is Minneapolis-based NatureWorks, a joint venture by Cargill, one of the world's largest privately-held corporations, and Thailand-based PTT Global Chemical. It is the largest PLA company in the world, capable of producing 150,000 metric tons of bioplastic pellets annually at a plant in Blair, Nebraska.

NatureWorks is building a $600 million plant in Thailand that will increase its production capacity by 50%, said Leah Ford, the company's global marketing communications manager, in an interview.

The company's “biggest visibility market,” Ford said, is compostable food service items such as plastic cutlery, clear cups, wrappers and containers that, along with restaurant food waste, can be converted into a dark organic material to enrich soil in gardens and on farms. That's important because food waste clogs recycling machinery and contaminates recyclable petroleum plastics.

Some Starbucks stores use disposable cups lined with NatureWorks' PLA, Ford said.

NatureWorks has become something of a game changer in the United Kingdom, where PG Tips, a big name in tea, has switched from polyester tea bags to bags made with cellulose and a thin layer of NatureWorks' PLA that are fully compostable, Ford said.

Researchers at McGill University in Montreal released a study in 2019 that said petroleum-based polyester tea bags leach billions of microplastic particles when steeped in hot water. Around 60 billion cups of tea are consumed annually in the UK.

One of the criticisms of bioplastic made with corn and sugar is that it uses arable land on a hungry planet. Ford called that concern unfounded. NatureWorks uses sugar extracted from corn while the rest of the kernels are used to produce sweeteners, ethanol, cooking oils and livestock feed.

PLA, unlike PHA, does not easily biodegrade in nature. It needs to be mixed with food waste in industrial composters to biodegrade. When buried in landfills, PLA will eventually disintegrate, but that would likely take decades.

NatureWorks has formed a partnership with PHA manufacturer CJ Bio to produce a bioplastic that can more easily biodegrade. The company, headquartered in South Korea, is expanding its plant in Indonesia and is planning to build a large plant in the Americas, said Raj Kirsch, vice president of research and development at CJ Bio.

Blending the two types of bioplastic “brings a lot of value propositions to the final end product,"" Kirsch said in an interview.

Ramani Narayan, a professor of chemical engineering at Michigan State University, has worked with Cargill in the past to help with PLA production.

Narayan said companies are using biodegradability claims to make their products more attractive to consumers. But the term is “misused, abused and overused because everything in the world is biodegradable given the right time and environment.""

California, Narayan noted, has banned the use of the term “biodegradable” in marketing. The world needs to replace petroleum plastic with plastic materials that have been verified and certified as completely biodegradable, he said.

Narayan acknowledged that bioplastics are easier to biodegrade than petrochemical plastic which can take centuries to disintegrate, shedding worrisome microplastic along the way. Yet the fact that PHA takes longer to break down in cold oceans and lakes than in temperate climes shouldn't be sugarcoated.

“It will take time, and you need to say that,” Narayan said."

SEOUL, South Korea -- Some of the heaviest rain in decades swamped South Korea’s capital region, turning Seoul’s streets into car-clogged rivers and sending floods cascading into subway stations. At least nine people were killed — some drowning in their homes — and six others were missing, with more rain forecast, officials said Tuesday.

More than 45 centimeters (18 inches) of rain was measured in Seoul’s hardest-hit Dongjak district from Monday to Tuesday evening. Precipitation in the area exceeded 14 centimeters (5.5 inches) per hour at one point Monday night, the highest hourly downpour measured in Seoul since 1942.

Deserted cars and buses were scattered across streets as the water receded on Tuesday. Workers cleared uprooted trees, mud and debris with excavators and blocked off broken roads. Landslide warnings were issued in nearly 50 cities and towns, and 160 hiking paths in Seoul and mountainous Gangwon province were closed.

Emergency crews worked overnight to restore most subway service as of Tuesday morning. A route linking towns north of Seoul was temporarily shut before reopening Tuesday evening as continuing rain flooded some stations.

Dozens of roads, including major expressways near the swollen Han River, were closed because of rising water levels or partial flooding.

“The heavy rainfall is expected to continue for days … we need to maintain our sense of alert and respond with all-out effort,” President Yoon Suk Yeol said at the government’s emergency headquarters.

The military was prepared to deploy troops to help with recovery efforts if requested by cities or regional governments, Defense Ministry spokesperson Moon Hong-sik said.

The rain began Monday morning and strengthened through the evening.

By nightfall, people were wading through thigh-high waters in streets in Gangnam, one of Seoul’s most bustling business and leisure districts, where cars and buses were stuck in mud-brown waters. Commuters evacuated as water cascaded down the stairs of the Isu subway station like a waterfall. In the nearby city of Seongnam, a rain-weakened hillside collapsed into a university soccer field.

Rescue workers failed to reach three people -– two sisters in their 40s and a 13-year-old girl -– who called for help before drowning in a basement home in the Gwanak district of southern Seoul on Monday night. Another woman drowned in her home in the nearby Dongjak district, where a public worker died while clearing fallen trees, likely from electrocution. Choi Seon-yeong, an official from the Dongjak district office, said it wasn’t immediately clear whether the death was caused by a damaged power source or equipment the man was using.

Three people were found dead in the debris of landslides and a collapsed bus station in the nearby cities of Gwangju and Hwaseong.

Four people were missing in southern Seoul’s Seocho district, the home of Yoon, who, according to his office, spent hours on the phone receiving briefings and issuing instructions overnight as rain flooded streets near his high-rise apartment complex.

Nearly 800 buildings in Seoul and nearby cities were damaged and around 1,380 people were forced to evacuate from their homes as of Tuesday evening, the Ministry of the Interior and Safety said.

The country’s weather agency maintained a heavy rain warning for the Seoul metropolitan area and nearby regions on Tuesday and said precipitation may reach 5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches) an hour in some areas. It said around 10 to 35 centimeters (4 to 14 inches) of additional rain was expected across the capital region through Thursday.

Rainstorms also pounded North Korea, where authorities issued heavy rain warnings for the southern and western parts of the country. North Korea’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper described the rain as potentially disastrous and called for measures to protect farmland and prevent flooding on the Taedong River, which flows through the capital, Pyongyang."

All three men are already serving life in prison for Arbery's killing after being found guilty of murder in a Georgia state court last fall. The McMichaels were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole while Bryan was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole.

The three white men were convicted in the federal case in February by a jury who decided that they followed and killed Arbery because he was Black.

After deliberating for less than four hours, the federal jury convicted all three men of being motivated by racial hate in interference of Arbery's civil rights and attempted kidnapping. Travis McMichael and his father were also convicted of carrying and brandishing a weapon during the commission of a crime of violence. Travis McMichael was also found guilty of discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence.

The McMichaels chased Arbery in their pickup truck after they saw him jogging in their neighborhood, falsely believing he had been responsible for several break-ins in coastal Georgia's Satilla Shores neighborhood. Bryan joined the chase in his own truck, blocking Arbery from escaping, and recorded cellphone footage of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery with a shotgun after a brief struggle.

During the trial, prosecutors released text messages and social media posts in which Travis McMichael and Bryan repeatedly used racist slurs. Witnesses also testified to hearing both McMichaels make racist comments.

Back-to-school season is in full swing -- and running up against the ongoing national teacher shortage.

In 2019, the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank, estimated that by 2024, the U.S. would need more than 300,000 teachers to fill the demand for educators nationwide.

Several factors have worsened the problem in the last two years: Teachers have retired or walked away from the profession citing the coronavirus pandemic, higher levels of disrespect from students and parents, excessive lesson planning and safety concerns among other things.

Dr. Christy Foust, a former teacher, said a low salary was just one factor that drove her out of the profession.

""Would you stay in your job if you're not paid enough based on your education and your experience?"" Foust told ABC affiliate WFTS in Tampa, Florida.

And we have politicians who want to ban books and censor curriculum rather than help teachers meet the social, emotional, and academic needs of kids,"" AFT president Randi Weingarten said in a statement to ""GMA,"" in part referencing efforts by a growing number of state, local, and federal politicians to ban certain topics from the classroom, including references to racism and LGBTQ+ issues.

""The teacher shortage is the direct result of the culture war and the shortage of conditions, respect and pay -- and we are not going to fix the one without addressing the others.""

""Some people will say this will never happen, it costs too much money,"" Weingarten added. ""But many things can be started today at no cost -- taking steps to build a culture where professionals work together and with parents to provide the best possible education to students, reduce paperwork and focus more on teaching than testing. These are all important steps that can help make this a more sustainable, respected profession.""

How school districts are responding to the shortage

Education officials across the country are testing a variety of methods to combat teacher fatigue and boost morale, in addition to upping pay and benefits. Here are a few ways school districts have tried addressing the problem so far.

Financial incentives

Some school districts are providing bonuses and stipends to retain and attract new teachers, in addition to boosting base pay.

District of Columbia Public Schools, in the nation's capital, is offering teachers signing bonuses of $2,500 if they commit to teaching one of the ""highest need content areas,"" such as special education, elementary education and visual and performing arts.

In Nevada, school districts including Clark County School District, the fifth largest school district in the U.S. where students returned to school Monday, is offering $5,000 retention bonuses for teachers who stay for the 2022-2023 school year and $4,000 relocation bonuses for teachers who move over 100 miles or out of state in order to teach in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas. Washoe County School District in the northwestern region of the state is offering teachers a one-time stipend of $1,500 for new teachers and $2,500 for returning teachers.

For the upcoming school year, the Austin Independent School District is offering a $2,000 retention stipend for teachers and other staffers. The district is also adding on a $500 signing bonus for pre-K teachers and physical education teaching assistants as well as a $1,000 signing bonus for special education teaching assistants.

Relaxed qualifications

Some states are dropping certain requirements for those interested in teaching. Individuals in Arizona, for example, will no longer need a bachelor's degree to teach after Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed a bill last month. They can start working within a classroom before they finish a degree program and while they're in school to complete their degree.

In Arizona, as well as Alabama, teachers with expired licenses will also have an easier time renewing them, with Alabama offering teachers a one-time renewal option without any academic requirements.

Shortened school weeks

Some school districts, especially those in rural areas, have switched to four-day school weeks already; Marshfield R-I School District in southwestern Missouri and Jasper Independent School District in southeastern Texas, will switch to a four-day week starting this fall.

John Seybold, superintendent of the Jasper Independent School District, told ""GMA"" in April that teacher burnout ""has been an issue for a long time, but since COVID, it has seemed to expand, and it's becoming more and more of an issue.""

""The four-day week kind of makes it a little more manageable for them because there's so much pressure placed on our teachers,"" he said at the time. ""As a school district, ultimately the best thing we can do for kids is put the best possible teacher in front of them every day.""

Housing help

It's no secret that the cost of living has increased and inflation remains high enough that some districts have looked into providing a longer-term solution for bringing in and keeping teachers in their local communities.

Jefferson Union High School District in Daly City, California, south of San Francisco, for instance, has developed a housing complex for teachers and district staff that offers more than 120 rental units at below-market rates.

Recruiting foreign teachers

Okeechobee County School District in central Florida has recruited teachers from overseas, and has hired educators from multiple countries, including India, the Philippines, Mexico, Jamaica, and Peru, in part to help ease their local teacher shortage."

NEW YORK -- It's a question that keeps some scientists awake at night: Do spiders sleep?

Daniela Roessler and her colleagues trained cameras on baby jumping spiders at night to find out. The footage showed patterns that looked a lot like sleep cycles: The spiders' legs twitched and parts of their eyes flickered.

The researchers described this pattern as a “REM sleep-like state.” In humans, REM, or rapid eye movement, is an active phase of sleep when parts of the brain light up with activity and is closely linked with dreaming.

Other animals, including some birds and mammals, have been shown to experience REM sleep. But creatures like the jumping spider haven’t gotten as much attention so it wasn't known if they got the same kind of sleep, said Roessler, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Konstanz in Germany.

Their findings were published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Roessler and her team dug into the sleep question after she discovered the spiders hanging at night from threads of silk in their lab containers. She had recently scooped up some jumping spiders to study, a common species with a furry brown body and four pairs of big eyes.

“It was just the most unusual thing I’ve ever seen,” Roessler said of the suspended spiders.

The research showed the spiders’ overnight movements looked a lot like REM in other species, she said — like dogs or cats twitching in their sleep. And they happened in regular cycles, similar to sleep patterns in humans.

Many species similar to spiders actually don’t have movable eyes, which makes it hard to compare their sleep cycles, explained study co-author Paul Shamble, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University.

But these jumping spiders are predators that move their retinas around to change their gaze while they hunt, Shamble said. Plus, the young spiders have a see-through outer layer that gives a clear window into their bodies.

“Sometimes as a biologist, you just get really, really lucky,” Shamble said.

The researchers still have to figure out if the spiders are technically sleeping while they’re in these resting states, Roessler said. That includes testing whether they respond more slowly — or not at all — to triggers that would normally set them off.

Critters like the jumping spider are very far from humans on the evolutionary tree. Jerry Siegel, a sleep researcher who was not involved with the study, said he's doubtful that the spiders can really experience REM sleep.

“There may be animals that have activity in quiet states,” said Siegel, of the UCLA Center for Sleep Research. “But are they REM sleep? It’s hard to imagine that they could be the same thing.”

But Barrett Klein, an entomologist at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse who was also not involved with the study, said it was exciting to find REM-like signs in such a distant relative. Many questions remain about how widespread REM sleep is and what purpose it might serve for species, he said.

REM sleep is “still very much a black box,” Klein said.

The Soyuz rocket lifted off as scheduled at 8:52 a.m. Moscow time (0552 GMT) Tuesday from the Russia-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan.

About nine minutes after the launch, it placed the Iranian satellite called Khayyam into orbit. It's named after Omar Khayyam, a Persian scientist who lived in the 11th and 12th centuries.

Iran has said the satellite fitted with high-resolution camera will be used for environmental monitoring and will remain fully under its control.

Tehran said no other country will have access to information it gathers and it would be used for civilian purposes only, but there have been allegations that Russia may use it for surveillance of Ukraine amid its military action there.

If it operates successfully, the satellite would give Iran the ability to monitor its archenemy Israel and other countries in the Middle East.

Yuri Borisov, head of Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos, hailed the launch as an “important landmark"" in cooperation between Moscow and Tehran.

Iranian state television aired footage of the launch live, noting that the country’s telecommunications minister attended the liftoff in Kazakhstan. Tehran said the satellite will help improve productivity in the agriculture sector, survey water resources, manage natural disasters, confront deforestation and monitor border areas.

Citing Iran’s civilian space agency, state television said the satellite would provide high-resolution surveillance images with a one-meter-per-pixel definition. Western civilian satellites offer around half-a-meter per pixel, while U.S. spy satellites are believed to have even-greater definition.

“This study underscores how climate change may load the dice to favor unwelcome infectious surprises,” Bernstein said in an email.","A new study finds climate hazards aggravate more than half of the known diseases that infect people

Climate hazards such as flooding, heat waves and drought have worsened more than half of the hundreds of known infectious diseases in people, including malaria, hantavirus, cholera and anthrax, a study says.

Researchers looked through the medical literature of established cases of illnesses and found that 218 out of the known 375 human infectious diseases, or 58%, seemed to be made worse by one of 10 types of extreme weather connected to climate change, according to a study in Monday’s journal Nature Climate Change.

The study mapped out 1,006 pathways from the climate hazards to sick people. In some cases, downpours and flooding sicken people through disease-carrying mosquitos, rats and deer. There are warming oceans and heat waves that taint seafood and other things we eat and droughts that bring bats carrying viral infections to people.

Doctors, going back to Hippocrates, have long connected disease to weather, but this study shows how widespread the influence of climate is on human health.

“If climate is changing, the risk of these diseases are changing,” said study co-author Dr. Jonathan Patz, director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Doctors, such as Patz, said they need to think of the diseases as symptoms of a sick Earth.

“The findings of this study are terrifying and illustrate well the enormous consequences of climate change on human pathogens,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, an Emory University infectious disease specialist, who was not part of the study. “Those of us in infectious diseases and microbiology need to make climate change one of our priorities, and we need to all work together to prevent what will be without doubt a catastrophe as a result of climate change.”

In addition to looking at infectious diseases, the researchers expanded their search to look at all type of human illnesses, including non-infectious sicknesses such as asthma, allergies and even animal bites to see how many maladies they could connect to climate hazards in some way, including infectious diseases. They found a total of 286 unique sicknesses and of those 223 of them seemed to be worsened by climate hazards, nine were diminished by climate hazards and 54 had cases of both aggravated and minimized, the study found.

The new study doesn’t do the calculations to attribute specific disease changes, odds or magnitude to climate change, but finds cases where extreme weather was a likely factor among many.

Study lead author Camilo Mora, a climate data analyst at the University of Hawaii, said what is important to note is that the study isn’t about predicting future cases.

“There is no speculation here whatsoever,” Mora said. ""These are things that have already happened.”

One example Mora knows firsthand. About five years ago, Mora’s home in rural Colombia was flooded — for the first time in his memory water was in his living room, creating an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes — and Mora contracted Chikungunya, a nasty virus spread by mosquito bites. And even though he survived, he still feels joint pain years later.

Sometimes climate change acts in odd ways. Mora includes the 2016 case in Siberia when a decades-old reindeer carcass, dead from anthrax, was unearthed when the permafrost thawed from warming. A child touched it, got anthrax and started an outbreak.

Mora originally wanted to search medical cases to see how COVID-19 intersected with climate hazards, if at all. He found cases where extreme weather both exacerbated and diminished chances of COVID-19. In some cases, extreme heat in poor areas had people congregate together to cool off and get exposed to the disease, but in other situations, heavy downpours reduced COVID spread because people stayed home and indoors, away from others.

Longtime climate and public health expert Kristie Ebi at the University of Washington cautioned that she had concerns with how the conclusions were drawn and some of the methods in the study. It is an established fact that the burning of coal, oil and natural gas has led to more frequent and intense extreme weather, and research has shown that weather patterns are associated with many health issues, she said.

“However, correlation is not causation,” Ebi said in an email. “The authors did not discuss the extent to which the climate hazards reviewed changed over the time period of the study and the extent to which any changes have been attributed to climate change.”

But Dr. Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard School of Public Health, Emory’s del Rio and three other outside experts said the study is a good warning about climate and health for now and the future. Especially as global warming and habitat loss push animals and their diseases closer to humans, Bernstein said.

“This study underscores how climate change may load the dice to favor unwelcome infectious surprises,” Bernstein said in an email. “But of course it only reports on what we already know and what’s yet unknown about pathogens may be yet more compelling about how preventing further climate change may prevent future disasters like COVID-19.”

For many decades, American consumers have valued China’s ability to produce inexpensive goods.
For now, American consumers have more to be worried about, like 40-year-high inflation and a possible recession.","Economists see rising prices and a delay of shipments as possible impacts.

When Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi arrived in Taiwan last week, the world braced for China's response. Within hours of her departure, China began military exercises around Taiwan, leaving the world wondering how far China is willing to take its response. Evidence suggests China will not stop at military drills.

""The last time we [saw] a crisis like this was in 1996,"" Kai Hao Yang, assistant professor of economics at Yale School of Management, told ABC News. ""At that time [the] computer chips market was not dominated by Taiwan manufacturers yet, plus the market was a lot smaller than it is right now.""

Chinese President Xi Jinping warned of economic consequences during a call with President Joe Biden before Pelosi's trip. How would U.S. consumers be impacted? First, China could hamstring Taiwan’s ability to export products. Taiwan is one of the United States’ top 10 trade partners. In addition to vehicles and machinery -- important Taiwanese imports -- the island is also home to TSMC, the largest manufacturer of computer processor chips in the world.

""Some people talk about China blockading Taiwan's ports so Taiwan's chips can’t go out,"" Ming-Jen Lin, professor of economics at National Taiwan University, said in an email to ABC News. ""If this really happens, it’s another story. But I think we are far from there.""

If China took this action, it could force U.S. tech companies to use chips manufactured in the U.S., which would increase prices for consumers.

""The unit cost of producing a chip is 50% higher in the U.S. than in Taiwan,"" Lin said.

The second way China’s retaliation threatens the American consumer is if Beijing chooses to impose economic penalties on U.S. trade. These actions could mean rising prices for American consumers and more supply-chain headaches.

""Chinese escalation could further exacerbate the supply-chain problem we’re facing right now,"" Yang said.

Former U.S. ambassador to China and former U.S. senator, Max Baucus, is more optimistic about the fallout.

""I think there'll be short-term disruption,” Baucus told ABC News, ""but I don’t think long term because business is so important to both countries.""

China is at a crossroads with where to go next. A war would be catastrophic and business sanctions are less than ideal.

""China worships at the altar of stability,” Baucus said. ""And they want to keep the country's economy stable. And that means business.""

For many decades, American consumers have valued China’s ability to produce inexpensive goods. Those days, however, could be numbered.

""The cheap price era of the past 20 years is definitely over,” Lin pointed out. ""I am not saying it will happen overnight, but definitely gradually.""

For now, American consumers have more to be worried about, like 40-year-high inflation and a possible recession. But economic uncertainty lies ahead as China and U.S. communication finds itself at a standstill."

Lyme disease, the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S., is a tick-borne infectious disease that, if left untreated, can affect the joints, heart and nervous system, according to the CDC.

There has not been a vaccine for the disease for the past 20 years. The most recent vaccine for the disease, LYMErix, was discontinued in the U.S. in 2002.

""This one is protein-based vaccine technology,"" ABC News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton said of the new Pfizer vaccine. ""It’s important to prevent not only short-term signs and symptoms of Lyme disease but long term, so we’re talking about things like short-term fever, headache, fatigue, rash, and then if untreated, it can spread to the joints, heart and central nervous system.""

The vaccine is administered through three shots given over a period of several months, followed by a booster dose 12 months later, according to Pfizer, who is developing the vaccine with Valneva, a French biotech firm.

If the trial moves forward as planned, Pfizer said it expects to submit an authorization request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2025.

Lyme disease, mainly caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted to humans via tick bites. In most cases, the tick must be attached to the skin for at least 36 hours before the bacterium can be transmitted.

Symptoms generally appear after one week, with approximately 70% to 80% of people experiencing a classic “bull's eye” rash which expands in size at the site of the bite.

Symptoms in the acute phase include fever, headache and fatigue. If left untreated, the infection can spread to joints, the heart and the nervous system. People also may experience lingering symptoms that last months or even years, such as muscle and joint pain, cognitive defects and sleep disturbances, according to the CDC.

Once confirmed with laboratory testing, most cases can be treated for a few weeks with antibiotics. According to the Mayo Clinic, Lyme disease should be treated immediately and may require intravenous antibiotics if the case is severe.

Lyme disease is most commonly found in the Northeast and upper Midwest, with 96% of all cases in 14 states -- Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin, according to the CDC.

The CDC recommends preventive measures to avoid ticks including avoiding ""wooded and brushy areas with high grass and leaf litter"" and walking in the center of trails.

When hiking or in wooded areas, you can also treat your clothes and gear with products containing 0.5% permethrin, according to the CDC. They also recommend always doing a ""tick check"" after being outside and wearing insect repellent with Deet.

Ticks can also come into the home through clothing and pets, so the CDC recommends checking pets for ticks and tumble drying clothes on high heat for 10 minutes after coming indoors to kill ticks.

If you are ever in a situation where you are bitten by a tick, the Cleveland Clinic recommends tugging gently but firmly near the head of the tick until it releases its hold on the skin.

People who are outdoors in areas that may have ticks should also conduct a full body check when they return, including checking under the arms, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, behind the knees, in and around the hair, between the legs and around the waist, the CDC recommends.

Once healed, monkeypox lesions can sometimes result in scarring and discoloration, which may be long-lasting or even permanent.
Though scarring from healed monkeypox lesions may not be entirely preventable, there are steps you can take to decrease the risk of scarring, including gentle skin care.","Last week monkeypox was declared a public health emergency in the U.S. and now with more than 8,900 confirmed cases of monkeypox, thousands of Americans are struggling with a defining feature of the condition, skin lesions.

The classic skin lesions of monkeypox start with a pimple-like lesion that can look like pus-filled bumps (pustules) with redness around them. After that, the rash goes through phases, including pustules progressing to blisters that eventually scab over.

Unfortunately, the skin lesions can leave an unwanted lasting change on the skin.

Dermatologists say monkeypox lesions should be covered in their active phase, as skin lesions are contagious until the rash has fully healed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said lesions are no longer contagious when the scabs have fallen off and a fresh layer of skin has formed.

Monkeypox lesions inevitably will scab over — and while that is a step in the right direction in terms of the infection, the sores underneath can scar.

What can monkeypox scarring look like?

Once healed, monkeypox lesions can sometimes result in scarring and discoloration, which may be long-lasting or even permanent.

""In some cases, patients may develop depressed or atrophic scars that may resemble those seen following chickenpox infection or with severe acne,"" Dr. Trisha Dasgupta, board-certified dermatologist at Dermatology of Philadelphia, told ABC News.

Monkeypox lesions may also heal with either dark discoloration or lightening of skin color.

""These scars can have varying appearances as well as degrees of severity,"" Dasgupta said.

Experts said lesions on the face, while concerning, often heal better than lesions on other parts of the body.

Dermatologists caution that some patients develop scars that can be firm, itchy, and even painful.

How can you minimize monkeypox scarring?

One of the best ways to manage a scar is to prevent a scar with good wound care during the healing process.

""The best way to prevent scarring is to take good care of your skin. Nowadays, we believe healing under moist conditions is better than just letting a scab dry out and become hard,"" Dr. Christine Ko, professor of dermatology at Yale University, told ABC News.

Experts describe wound healing as a cascade of events. Scientists who study wound healing at a cellular level describe skin cells that leapfrog over each other in a wound bed -- and the skin cells have a much easier time doing this if the wound bed is moist compared to a dry, open wound.

Though scarring from healed monkeypox lesions may not be entirely preventable, there are steps you can take to decrease the risk of scarring, including gentle skin care.

Dermatologists said while the spots can be itchy and irritated, it is important to avoid picking, scratching, or scrubbing monkeypox lesions.

""Consider using a gentle, fragrance-free, dye-free soap or cleanser to avoid any additional irritation when cleansing the area daily,"" Dr. Shoshana Grossman, board-certified dermatologist at Dermatology of Philadelphia, told ABC News.

Sun protection:

""Sun protection is one of the simplest and most effective ways to maximize the appearance of scars after monkeypox lesions have healed,"" Grossman said.

Dermatologists recommend a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 to lower the chance of darkening of the skin.

""Sun protection can be important to minimize scarring, especially in patients who have darker skin tones because scars can become quite dark in those patients and using some sun protection might help prevent that,"" Ko said.

Topical Treatments: For fully healed areas, using chemical exfoliants such as alpha-hydroxy acids and topical retinoids can be helpful to lower the chance of some types of scarring by increasing skin cell turnover and by stimulating the growth of healthy collagen.

""The limiting factor with these treatments is tolerability in terms of dryness or irritation; they should not be used on active lesions. The key with using these topical treatments is to start slowly — only a couple of times a week to start, building up gradually to nightly use,"" Grossman said.

How to avoid complications that can increase chance of monkeypox scarring

Monkeypox infections are caused by a virus. Sometimes as these viral lesions heal, other infections, including bacterial infections, can arise on top of the original viral infection.

""Preventing a superimposed bacterial infection in areas of existing or healing monkeypox is also crucial in preventing scarring. A good way to prevent a bacterial infection is by introducing an anti-bacterial wash into your shower routine a few times per week."" Grossman said.

Monkeypox scars that are bothersome or symptomatic can be treated with a variety of approaches, including:

Time: Most scars improve on their own with time, especially with good sun protection. It can take six to 12 months for full scar maturation. This is especially true for hyperpigmented scars, which can take many months to fade.

""Ideally, a scar will look closer to the normal skin color around it within four to five weeks, but it can sometimes take longer for scars to remodel and settle, even up to a year,"" Ko said.

Silicone containing scar gels: Medical-grade silicone scar gels and sheets may be a good option for scars that are thick or at risk of becoming thick.

""Silicone-based products can create a protective barrier over scars which increases hydration and helps stop excess collagen build up in the skin,"" Dasgupta said.

Steroid injections: For thicker, hypertrophic scars or keloids, a steroid medication can be directly injected into the problem areas.

""The goal of the steroid is to calm down any residual inflammation and flatten any raised areas. While systemic steroids such as pills, intravenous or intramuscular injections can have unwanted internal side effects, intralesional steroids remain localized to the skin and are very well tolerated,"" Grossman said.

Surgical procedures: Surgically removing a bothersome scar may be the most effective method of treating a scar.

Scars in the skin are sometimes caused by strands of collagen under the skin pulling down on the surface of the skin — often described as stakes of a tent pulling down on the skin. A specific type of minimally invasive procedure called a subcision can help break apart these band-like scars to allow for a smoother appearance on the skin's surface.

Microneedling is another minimally-invasive procedure in which many tiny needles are used to puncture the affected skin. ""These controlled micro-injuries to the skin help to encourage tissue remodeling by mimicking the skin's natural healing process,"" Grossman said.

Lasers: Depending on the location of the scar and skin type of the patient, lasers can be used to help improve the appearance of scars that are white or lighter in appearance than the surrounding skin. Lasers have to be carefully used in darker skin types and fractionated lasers are a specific laser approach that decreases downtime after lasers and can be safer in patients with darker skin tones."

The State Department, which leads work on securing the U.S. rare earths supply, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
But experts say the government weighs the regulation of rare earths against other green goals, such as the sales and use of electric vehicles.
The United States offshored its rare earths mining to China in the 1980s because of environmental and cost issues.
“They are mining rare earth everywhere and we are no longer safe to drink water,” she said.","The birds no longer sing, and the herbs no longer grow. The fish no longer swim in rivers that have turned a murky brown. The animals do not roam, and the cows are sometimes found dead.

The people in this northern Myanmar forest have lost a way of life that goes back generations. But if they complain, they, too, face the threat of death.

This forest is the source of several key metallic elements known as rare earths, often called the vitamins of the modern world. Rare earths now reach into the lives of almost everyone on the planet, turning up in everything from hard drives and cellphones to elevators and trains. They are especially vital to the fast-growing field of green energy, feeding wind turbines and electric car engines. And they end up in the supply chains of some of the most prominent companies in the world, including General Motors, Volkswagen, Mercedes, Tesla and Apple.

But an AP investigation has found that their universal use hides a dirty open secret in the industry: Their cost is environmental destruction, the theft of land from villagers and the funneling of money to brutal militias, including at least one linked to Myanmar’s secretive military government. As demand soars for rare earths along with green energy, the abuses are likely to grow.

“This rapid push to build out mining capacity is being justified in the name of climate change,” said Julie Michelle Klinger, author of the book “Rare Earths Frontiers,” who is leading a federal project to trace illicit energy minerals. “There’s still this push to find the right place to mine them, which is a place that is out of sight and out of mind.”

The AP investigation drew on dozens of interviews, customs data, corporate records and Chinese academic papers, along with satellite imagery and geological analysis gathered by the environmental non-profit Global Witness, to tie rare earths from Myanmar to the supply chains of 78 companies.

About a third of the companies responded. Of those, about two-thirds didn't or wouldn't comment on their sourcing, including Volkswagen, which said it was conducting due diligence for rare earths. Nearly all said they took environmental protection and human rights seriously.

Some companies said they audited their rare earth supply chains; others didn’t or required only supplier self-assessments. GM said it understood “the risks of heavy rare earths metals” and would source from an American supplier soon.

Tesla did not respond to repeated requests for comment, and Mercedes said they contacted suppliers to learn more in response to this story. Apple said “a majority” of their rare earths were recycled and they found “no evidence” of any from Myanmar, but experts say in general there is usually no way to make sure.

Just as dirty rare earths trickle down the supply chains of companies, they also slip through the cracks of regulation.

In 2010, in response to war in the Congo, Congress required companies to disclose the origin of so-called conflict minerals — tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten — and promise their sourcing does not benefit armed groups. But the law does not cover rare earths. Audits are left up to individual companies, and no single agency is held accountable.

The State Department, which leads work on securing the U.S. rare earths supply, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But experts say the government weighs the regulation of rare earths against other green goals, such as the sales and use of electric vehicles. With ongoing negotiations in Congress, the issue has become increasingly touchy, they say.

Rare earths are also omitted from the European Union’s 2021 regulation on conflict minerals. A European Commission statement noted gaps in oversight of the supply chain stretching to Europe, and said “it is yet unclear how” a Chinese push to regulate rare earths will work.

With no regulation or alternatives, companies have quietly continued shipping rare earths without environmental, social and governance audits, known as ESG.

“What would be the result if now the world would say, ‘We want to do ESG audits on all rare earths production’?” said Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade & Investment, which does mineral and metal supply chain management. “The result would be that 70% of production would need to be closed down.”

The story of rare earths is one of a naked grab for resources while leaving the wreckage to other countries.

The United States offshored its rare earths mining to China in the 1980s because of environmental and cost issues. China’s leader at the time, Deng Xiaoping, declared rare earths China’s answer to “oil in the Middle East.” Tens of thousands of Chinese in the countryside discovered that they could make more in a month of mining than years of farming.

For decades the industry prospered. China became the world’s foremost miner of rare earths. A Beijing magazine called the profits “more addictive than drugs.”

Then, stung by public criticism, officials in Beijing declared war on the country’s dirty industries, including rare earths mining. At a 2012 press conference in Beijing, a top Chinese industry official brandished photos of the devastation — pockmarked land stripped bare of vegetation.

Caught in the crossfire were miners like Guo, who asked to be identified by his last name only.

For years, Guo, a former car repairman, earned a handsome living after joining the booming rare earths industry in his native Jiangxi province. Then Beijing began enforcing some of the world’s strongest environmental laws, shutting down mom-and-pop operations like his. Chinese satellites now snap photos from space, hunting for hidden mines.

But even while the supply from China is now monitored, the global demand for rare earths is expected to explode by 300% to 700% by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. The proposed Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. would increase demand even more by subsidizing the sale of electric vehicles in one of the world’s largest markets.

“The disturbing reality is that the cash that fuels these abuses ultimately comes from the world’s fast-growing demand for these minerals, driven by the scaling up of green energy technologies,” said Clare Hammond, a senior researcher at Global Witness, which also conducted field work in Myanmar.

China is also responding to competition from Europe and its greatest rival, the United States, which has called its dependence on rare earths from China a “national security risk.” Concerned that its shrinking reserves could allow Western countries to break its stranglehold on the industry, China encouraged companies to look abroad.

“Environmental controls have become much stricter,” said a government trade researcher, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. “That’s why imports have increased. It’s better to get rare earths from abroad.”

The Chinese foreign, industrial and environmental ministries and the Jiangxi regional government did not respond to requests for comment.

As mines in China shuttered, ore prices rose. In neighboring Myanmar, home to some of the world’s richest deposits of what are known as heavy rare earths, opportunity beckoned. Thousands of Jiangxi miners streamed across the border.

“It reminds me of the European colonial attitudes towards Africa,” said an industry analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid damaging ties with the Chinese government. “You just can’t be relying on third-world-type mining practices in a dictatorship like Myanmar. It’s not sustainable.”

That does not bother Guo.

In 2019, he got a call. An old contact was opening up shop in Myanmar and needed a technician. Would he like to go?

Guo said yes, joining what he describes as a modern-day gold rush. He recounted primitive working conditions, including clouds of mosquitoes and nights spent burning logs in ramshackle cabins. The miners dug hundreds of feet deep with shovels and their bare, callused hands.

“I lived in a virgin forest, I lived like a savage,” he said.

He and other Chinese workers in Myanmar described a web of small, unlicensed private mines that sell to China’s big state-owned mining conglomerates — directly or through trade intermediaries. When cash changes hands, few questions are asked.

“I’m only responsible for digging the mountain up and selling it,” Guo said. “The rest is none of my business.”

Since 2015, imports from Myanmar have grown almost a hundredfold, according to UN trade data. Myanmar is now China’s single largest source of heavy rare earths, making up nearly half of the supply, according to Chinese customs data and expert estimates.

A few years ago, there were just two or three mines in Myanmar, then dozens. Today there are hundreds, and Guo guesses there may soon be thousands. At this pace, he predicts, it won’t be long before Myanmar’s rare earths are all gone.

But Guo cares little about preservation or politics.

“They talk about future generations, I’m talking about survival today,” he said. “We just see if we can make money. It’s that simple.”

There is a name for what Myanmar has become: A “sacrifice zone,” or a place that destroys itself for the good of the world.

The sacrifice is visible from the air, in toxic turquoise pools that dot the landscape covered by mountain jungles just a few years ago. Since rare earth clays in Myanmar are soft and near the surface, they can easily be scooped into these pools of chemicals. Satellite imagery commissioned by Global Witness showed more than 2,700 of these pools at almost 300 separate locations.

The leaching agents have tainted tributaries of Myanmar’s main river, prompted landslides and poisoned the earth, according to witnesses, miners and local activists. Water is no longer drinkable, and endangered species such as tigers, pangolins and red pandas have fled the area.

A villager who lives along a river some 15 miles from the center of the mining sites said his wife used to catch and sell fish. Now the few they can catch make them ill, so they must buy from elsewhere at higher prices instead. Every time he enters the water, his feet feel itchy.

“There are no fish along the creek, not even small fishes,” said the villager, who asked to be anonymous for his safety. “Everything went extinct.”

Militias are rampant in these northern forest frontier areas, with at least one tied to the Border Guard Force backed by the Myanmar military, or Tatmadaw. Since seizing power last year, the Tatmadaw is under international sanctions for human rights abuses, which means the rare earths money it gets from the militia may be going into a violent crackdown against civilians.

With the armed militias in control, villagers have no recourse to defend their land.

When village leaders filed a complaint about the effects of rare earth mining and testing on land needed for black cardamom, walnuts and livestock, a high-ranking militia leader aligned with the Border Guard Force angrily summoned them. He said rare earth mining would proceed with or without their agreement.

“You, village leaders, should solve this issue,” he yelled as he pointed to the leaders, according to a recording of the January meeting obtained by Global Witness, which was shared with and verified by the AP. “Otherwise, I’ll have to start shooting and killing people. Do not underestimate me. I am not a child — this is not child’s play.”

The Myanmar military, militia-owned mining companies and militia leaders did not respond to requests for comment.

In the meantime, mining projects continue to get ever closer to the land villagers are trying to protect.

“We dare not complain,” said a villager, who also asked to be anonymous for his safety. “If we say something … they beat us. We don’t want to be in prison.”

The militias and warlords have turned Myanmar’s frontier with China into a modern-day wild west, with each tiny fiefdom demanding a cut of the profits that flow through its land.

“(The money) has to be going to people that are not nice people,” said an executive at a Chinese magnets maker, who declined to be named to speak on a sensitive topic. “There’s no way out of it.”

For Dong, a Chinese miner, the hundreds of dollars he hands to the armed men lining the roads in Myanmar are the price of doing business.

“To enter Myanmar, you pay,” he said, declining to give his first name to speak on a sensitive topic. “It’s all about the money.”

Dong said police have told him that the rare earths he extracts can only be sold to China, not to the Americans or Japanese, because they are China’s strategic resources. He is under no illusions about the damage from acids so strong that they corrode the shovels of his bulldozers and excavators – something he’d never seen before.

“This stuff is unbelievable,” he said. “It’s definitely polluting.”

As rare earths from Myanmar travel around the world, they pass through many hands.

The most destructive mining is for heavy rare earths, which are critical to make powerful magnets heat-resistant. Ores are trucked across the border from illicit mines in Myanmar to southern China, where state-owned companies buy them up in sacks by the thousands. Among them: Minmetals, China Southern Rare Earth, and Rising Nonferrous Metals.

Some 70% of China Southern’s rare earth ores came from Myanmar, with the rest from recycling, Jiangxi customs official Liu Jingjing wrote in a paper. China Southern, among the world's largest processors of heavy rare earths, has no active mining in China, according to Liu’s paper. A company post highlighted how it is “seizing overseas rare earth resources” and “opening up” imports from Myanmar.

Minmetals, another major producer, warned shareholders in recent annual reports that it relied heavily on imports, as its one major mining project in China didn’t produce enough. Rising Nonferrous, the third company, wrote on their website in 2020 that their trading subsidiary had won approval from Chinese customs to import Myanmar heavy rare earth ores.

All three companies did not respond to calls, emails and faxes requesting comment.

Those companies in turn supply three major magnet companies: Yantai Zhenghai Magnetic Material, JL MAG, and Zhong Ke San Huan, public agreements show. Rising Nonferrous also supplies Guangdong TDK, a joint venture with Tokyo-based TDK, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of cell phone, laptop, and hard drive components and a supplier of Apple and Samsung. TDK and the magnet companies did not respond to requests for comment.

As the ore is transformed into magnets, it is separated, refined and melted, according to interviews with miners and magnet engineers. Along the way, materials from different sources often get mixed, making it difficult to track any particular shipment of rare earths from Myanmar to a specific batch of magnets.

Chinese magnet makers often don’t know where their rare earths come from because many multinational companies don’t ask, an engineer at one company noted.

“There’s never been like, where do you get your rare earth?” said the engineer, declining to be named to speak candidly. “There should be concern, but there’s no concern within the industry.”

The magnet companies go on to supply intermediaries like components manufacturers and trading companies as well as big brands. The rare earths can pass through many more tiers of suppliers before reaching a consumer.

“The transparency in this industry is just so poor that the companies don’t know,” said Kristin Vekasi, a professor studying rare earth sourcing at the University of Maine.

Among global carmakers, GM, Volkswagen, and Mercedes said they expect suppliers to adhere to codes of conduct and due diligence, and Mercedes added that they were designing new motors to eliminate heavy rare earths. Ford said they conduct audits and request suppliers to identify sourcing.

Hyundai denied using rare earths from Myanmar, and Stellantis said that “to the best of Stellantis’ knowledge,” their rare earth supply chains only involve operations in China. Some auto parts makers, including Bosch, Brose and Nidec, also said they were assured by the magnet companies that their components were free of rare earths from Myanmar. Others, such as Continental AG and BorgWarner, said they expected suppliers to adhere to their codes of conduct.

However, only an order from the Chinese government could force companies to separate rare earths from Myanmar and China, according to Nabeel Mancheri, secretary general of the Rare Earth Industry Association. The group is trying to build a blockchain-based verification to link up international customers with the Chinese companies “upstream.”

“Nothing exists on auditing the Chinese supply chain,” he said. “Downstream players simply rely on whatever certificate they get from Chinese companies.”

Among electronics giants, Samsung said they did not tolerate rights violations or environmental damage but did not answer other specific questions about their suppliers. Toshiba, Panasonic and Hitachi did not comment on suppliers but said they would suspend working with businesses violating human rights.

Thyssenkrupp said it had “initiated measures” to find out more about the origin of the minerals for its magnet supplier. Other machinery manufacturers like Mitsubishi did not respond.

Among wind turbine manufacturers, Siemens Gamesa, which has projects in the United States and Europe, said it audits immediate suppliers and is preparing to trace those further upstream. It said “supplier feedbacks” showed only rare earths from China. Other wind companies, like Xinjiang Goldwind, did not respond.

But Klinger, the expert on illicit minerals tracing, said the only way for a company to be certain to avoid rare earths from Myanmar is to have their supply chain “entirely outside of Myanmar, China and potentially outside Southeast Asia.” She said there are cleaner ways to mine, but they cost more — a huge hurdle in the cutthroat world of commodities.

Mike Coffman, a former congressman who pushed for the original U.S. conflict minerals rules a decade ago, said he would like to see an expansion of the domestic supply of rare earths minerals, which is now before Congress. And U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, introduced a measure this year aimed at reducing U.S. reliance on China for rare earths and other critical minerals.

However, alternatives are still a long way in the future. In 2022, the U.S. and Australian governments both backed domestic rare earths projects with multimillion dollar financing, but facilities are years and tons of metals behind China’s current capacity.

Other countries with rare earths deposits are reluctant to mine them. Greenland’s parliament last year voted to halt a rare earth mining project, and efforts to develop a promising deposit in Sweden stalled because of local objections.

In the meantime, villagers still protest in one area in northern Myanmar where the black cardamom and walnuts grow — for now. Standing in the green mountains under a tree, a villager made it clear why they continue to raise their voices even when there’s been no recourse for others just a few mountains away.

“They are mining rare earth everywhere and we are no longer safe to drink water,” she said. “There is nothing to support the children. Nothing to eat.”

The 23-time Grand Slam winner penned a new personal essay for Vogue magazine revealed exclusively on ""Good Morning America"" Tuesday, titled ""The Hardest Thing"" to say farewell to the game in her own way and in her own words.

Williams said she hates the word retirement, writing: ""The best word to describe what I'm up to is evolution. I'm here to tell you that I'm evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.""

The former No. 1 ranked women's tennis player and four-time Olympic gold medalist said there is ""no happiness in this topic for me"" as she wants to focus on family and her business investment empire. Williams explained that she doesn't feel she can do that while also playing tennis.

""But these days, if I have to choose between building my tennis résumé and building my family, I choose the latter ... In the last year, Alexis and I have been trying to have another child, and we recently got some information from my doctor that put my mind at ease and made me feel that whenever we’re ready, we can add to our family. I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete. I need to be two feet into tennis or two feet out,"" Williams wrote.

Williams' tech investment firm, Serena Ventures, has helped invest early in businesses including MasterClass, Tonal and Noom. The firm launched earlier this year with an inaugural $111 million early-stage venture capital fund and 78% of their companies' portfolios have been founded by women and people of color.

Williams continued, ""I don’t particularly like to think about my legacy. I get asked about it a lot, and I never know exactly what to say. But I’d like to think that thanks to opportunities afforded to me, women athletes feel that they can be themselves on the court.""

The 40-year-old tennis superstar turned pro at just 14 in 1995 and notched her first career Grand Slam title at Wimbledon in 1998.

Although this is the closest she's come to a possible retirement, it's not the end for the champ just yet. Williams scored her first tournament singles win in over a year at the WTA National Bank Open in Toronto and plans to play in the U.S. Open in New York City.

""I’m not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment. I’m terrible at goodbyes, the world’s worst,"" she wrote. ""But please know that I am more grateful for you than I can ever express in words. You have carried me to so many wins and so many trophies.

On Friday, California residents who might be eligible to receive reparations from the state met at the offices of Black Women for Wellness in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Leimert Park to share their opinions on what reparations were needed.

“In my family we have been affected by eminent domain,” said Hawthorne, California, resident Ashley Lambey, 33, during the meeting Friday. “We haven’t been able to get anything in terms of what our parents left for us,” she said, referring to the right of the government to seize private property for public use.

“A lot of young kids don’t know about Jim Crow,” said Kathy Clark, 71, a resident of the Paramount/East Compton area who also attended the meeting. “I had to sit on the sidewalk; I couldn’t sit at the counter to eat my hot dog,” said Clark, recalling the days when state and local laws enforced racial segregation in the United States.

“There are so many tables that need to be overturned and reset,” said Donyell Smith, 53, a resident of San Diego who attended the meeting virtually. “Reparations is due in every single area.”

The meeting, one of dozens of sessions that will be held across the state this month, is part of a community engagement initiative run by the Bunche Center at UCLA and overseen by the state’s Reparations Task Force.

In September 2020, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law AB 3121, creating a task force that would study the state’s history of slavery and make recommendations for reparations. California is the only state currently developing a reparations proposal.

In 2020, state Assemblyman James Gallagher, who was one of twelve legislators to vote against the bill creating the California Reparations Task Force, told California Public Radio that “it’s like almost assuredly designed to be people from one party and probably from more of one perspective than the legislative process, which would include everybody.”

Gallagher also told California Public Radio that the issue of reparations for slavery should be determined by the federal government, echoing a common argument against municipal reparations programs.

The 11 legislators who voted against the bill and who remain in office were unavailable for comment when contacted by ABC News. Another legislator who voted against the task force was voted out of office in March 2020.

In March, the task force voted to limit eligibility to descendants of free or enslaved Black people living in the U.S. before the 20th century.

The purpose of these sessions is to educate the public, increase community buy-in, and record residents’ testimonies in a report the task force can use when making recommendations to the state in its final report due July 2023. The task force released a nearly 500-page interim report in June.

At the community listening session on Friday, 20 attendees spoke about their families’ migration stories, the harm they suffered from the legacy of slavery and anti-Black racism, and what sorts of reparations programs they would like to see. They discussed how reparations could take the form of financial literacy training, mental health resources and political reform.

“The community has to lead,” Kamilah Moore, chair of the California Reparations Task Force, told ABC News. “Under international human rights law… the victim group or the community of eligibility should be leading the process for what reparations should look like.”

More than a dozen community listening sessions have already been held up and down the state, from Sacramento to San Diego, and they will continue to be held until September. “The point is to meet the community where they are at,” said Moore.

“I feel like we are making history, we are literally writing the script,” Chris Lodgson, an organizer with Coalition for a Just and Equitable California, one of the seven community organizations chosen to moderate the community listening sessions, told ABC News.

“I feel lucky, I feel blessed, I feel fortunate, I feel proud just to be a part of this history,” said Lodgson."

Angel Hope looked at the math test and felt lost. He had just graduated near the top of his high school class, winning scholarships from prestigious colleges. But on this test — a University of Wisconsin exam that measures what new students learned in high school — all he could do was guess.

It was like the disruption of the pandemic was catching up to him all at once.

Nearly a third of Hope’s high school career was spent at home, in virtual classes that were hard to follow and easy to brush aside. Some days he skipped school to work extra hours at his job. Some days he played games with his brother and sister. Other days he just stayed in bed.

Algebra got little of his attention, but his teachers kept giving him good grades amid a school-wide push for leniency.

“It was like school was optional. It wasn't a mandatory thing,” said Hope, 18, of Milwaukee. “I feel like I didn’t really learn anything.”

Across the country, there are countless others like him. Hundreds of thousands of recent graduates are heading to college this fall after spending more than half their high school careers dealing with the upheaval of a pandemic. They endured a jarring transition to online learning, the strains from teacher shortages and profound disruptions to their home lives. And many are believed to be significantly behind academically.

Colleges could see a surge in students unprepared for the demands of college-level work, education experts say. Starting a step behind can raise the risk of dropping out. And that can hurt everything from a person's long-term earnings to the health of the country's workforce.

The extent of the problem became apparent to Allison Wagner as she reviewed applications for All-In Milwaukee, a scholarship program that provides financial aid and college counseling to low-income students, including Hope.

Wagner, the group’s executive director, saw startling numbers of students who were granted permission to spend half the school day working part-time jobs their senior year, often at fast food chains or groceries. And she saw more students than ever who didn’t take math or science classes their senior year, often as a result of teacher shortages.

“We have so many students who are going on to college academically malnourished,” Wagner said. “There is no way they are going to be academically prepared for the rigor of college.”

Her group is boosting its tutoring budget and covering tuition for students in the program who take summer classes in math or science. Still, she fears the setbacks will force some students to take more than four years to graduate or, worse, drop out.

“The stakes are tremendously high,” she said.

Researchers say it’s clear that remote instruction caused learning setbacks, most sharply among Black and Hispanic students. For younger students, there’s still hope that America's schools can accelerate the pace of instruction and close learning gaps. But for those who graduated in the last two years, experts fear many will struggle.

In anticipation of higher needs, colleges from New Jersey to California have been expanding “bridge” programs that provide summer classes, often for students from lower incomes or those who are the first in their families to attend college. Programs previously treated as orientation are taking on a harder academic edge, with a focus on math, science and study skills.

In Hanceville, Alabama, Wallace State Community College this year tapped state money to create its first summer bridge program as it braces for an influx of underprepared students. Students could take three weeks of accelerated lessons in math and English in a bid to avoid remedial classes.

The school hoped to bring up to 140 students to campus, but just 10 signed up.

Other states have used federal pandemic relief to help colleges build summer programs. In Kentucky, which gave colleges $3.5 million for the effort this year, officials called it a “moral imperative.”

“We need these people to be our future workforce, and we need them to be successful,” said Amanda Ellis, a vice president of Kentucky’s Council on Postsecondary Education.

After the pandemic hit, Angel Hope worked up to 20 hours a week at his job with a local nonprofit aid group. He felt the time away from school was worth it for the money, especially when nobody was paying attention in the online classes. With his parents away at work, he often felt alone, shunning social media for days and eating ramen noodles for dinner.

“I think isolating myself was a little bit of my coping mechanism,” he said. “I was kind of like, ‘Keep it in a little bit and you’ll get through it eventually.’”

The pandemic led many high schoolers to disengage at a time when they would usually be preparing for college or careers, said Rey Saldaña, president and CEO of Communities in Schools, a nonprofit group that places counselors in public schools in 26 states.

His group worked in some districts where hundreds of students simply didn’t return after classrooms reopened. In Charlotte, North Carolina, the allure of steady paychecks kept many students away from school even after in-person classes resumed, said Shakaka Perry, a reengagement coordinator for Communities in Schools.

Perry and her colleagues spent last school year bringing students back to school and getting them ready for graduation. But when she thinks about whether they're ready for college, she has doubts: “It’s going to be an awakening.”

A couple months after struggling through his math placement test, Hope headed to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for six weeks of intense classes at a summer bridge program. He took a math class that covered the ground he missed in high school, and he's signed up to take calculus in the fall.

He also revived basic study skills that went dormant in high school. He started studying at the library. He got used to the rhythms of school, with assignments every day and tests every other week. He rediscovered what it's like to enjoy school.

Most importantly, he says it changed his mindset: Now he feels like he’s there to learn, not just to get by.

“After this, I definitely feel prepared for college,” he said. “If I didn’t have this, I would be in a very bad place.”

Iconic, Issey Miyake.""","Legendary Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake has died.

Miyake died from liver cancer Friday morning in Tokyo. He was 84 years old.

The designer was known for everything from unique designs and fine fragrances to being the creator behind the statement black turtlenecks worn by Apple's Steve Jobs.

Miyake's company confirmed that a private funeral has already taken place.

Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake was 7 years old when the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb on the city during World War II. He discussed the bombing as an adult with The New York Times in 2009, mentioning that he didn't want to be known as ""the designer who survived the atomic bomb.""

In 1971, the first Issey Miyake collection launched in New York, and shortly after, was shown during Paris Fashion Week Autumn/Winter 1973.

Through the years, the company has displayed everything from extraordinary textures and eclectic styles to chic modern everyday wear.

In Walter Isaacson's biography of the Apple co-creator, Jobs said he had enough of his statement-making Issey Miyake black turtlenecks to last a lifetime. The designer made him more than 100 sweaters that he paired with jeans as his uniform until the day he died.

On Tuesday, fans and fashion industry notables started sharing their condolences for Miyake on social media.

""Farewell, Issey Miyake, sculptor of cloth. Comfort dressing has never been so chic,"" tweeted New York Times and INYT fashion director/critic Vanessa Friedman.

Fashion and costume historian Shelby Ivey Christie also chimed in, saying, ""What a great legacy to leave behind. Innovation, thoughtful design without compromising his culture’s influence, true originality + the inspo for a House. Iconic, Issey Miyake.""

""MIYAKE broke the boundaries between East and West and pursued 'the body, the fabric covering it and a comfortable relationship between the two' as a fundamental concept, both shocking and resonating with people the world over,"" the company said on its website.

Miyake handed over design duties to his associate, Naoki Takizawa, now a design director at Uniqlo, in 1999. The brand is current led by Satoshi Kondo, who took over as design director for the brand's spring/summer 2020 collection."

“Their structures were simple and direct,” Gerri Hirshey wrote in the Motown history “Nowhere to Run: The Story of Soul Music,” published in 1984.
Dozier and the Hollands clashed often and Dozier dropped out before the show launched.
His children included the songwriter-record producer Beau Dozier and composer Paris Ray Dozier.
Like so many Motown artists, Dozier was born in Detroit and raised in a family of singers and musicians.","NEW YORK -- Lamont Dozier, the middle name of the celebrated Holland-Dozier-Holland team that wrote and produced “You Can’t Hurry Love,” “Heat Wave” and dozens of other hits and helped make Motown an essential record company of the 1960s and beyond, has died at age 81.

Dozier died “peacefully” Monday at his home near Scottsdale, Arizona, according to a statement issued by his family. The cause of death was not immediately determined. Duke Fakir, a close friend and the last surviving member of the original Four Tops, called Dozier a “beautiful, talented guy” with an uncanny sense of what material worked best for a given group.

“I like to call Holland-Dozier-Holland ‘tailors of music,’” he said Tuesday during a telephone interview. “They could take any artist, call them into their office, talk to them, listen to them and write them a top 10 song.”

In Motown’s historic, self-defined rise to the “Sound of Young America,” Holland-Dozier-Holland stood out even compared to such gifted peers as Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder and Barrett Strong. Over a four-year period, 1963-67, Dozier and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland crafted more than 25 top 10 songs and mastered the blend of pop and rhythm and blues that allowed the Detroit label, and founder Berry Gordy, to defy boundaries between Black and white music and rival the Beatles on the airwaves.

For the Four Tops, they wrote “Baby I Need Your Loving” and “Reach Out (I’ll Be There),” for Martha and the Vandellas they wrote “Heat Wave” and “Jimmy Mack,” for Marvin Gaye “Baby Don’t You Do It” and “How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You).” The music lived on through countless soundtracks, samplings and radio airings, in cover versions by the Rolling Stones, Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor and many others and in generations of songwriters and musicians influenced by the Motown sound.

“Their structures were simple and direct,” Gerri Hirshey wrote in the Motown history “Nowhere to Run: The Story of Soul Music,” published in 1984. “Sometimes a song barreled to number one on the sheer voice of repetitive hooks, like a fast-food jingle that lurks, subliminally, until it connects with real hunger.”

Brian Wilson, Ronnie Wood and Mick Hucknall were among the many musicians offering tributes Tuesday. Carole King, who with then-husband Gerry Goffin was another leading hitmaker of the '60s, tweeted that “striving to keep up with them made us better songwriters.”

The polish of H-D-H was ideally suited for Motown’s signature act, Diana Ross and the Supremes, for whom they wrote 10 No. 1 songs, among them “Where Did Our Love Go,” “Stop! In the Name of Love” and “You Can’t Hurry Love.” Expectations were so high that when “Nothing But Heartaches” failed to make the top 10 in 1965, Gordy sent a company memo demanding that Motown only release chart toppers for the Supremes, an order H-D-H obeyed with “I Hear a Symphony” and several more records.

Holland-Dozier-Holland weren’t above formulas or closely repeating a previous hit, but they worked in various moods and styles: the casual joy of “How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You),” the escalating desire of “Heat Wave,” the urgency of “Reach Out (I’ll Be There).” Dozier’s focus was on melody and arrangements, whether the haunting echoes of the Vandellas’ backing vocals on “Nowhere To Run,” flashing lights of guitar that drive the Supremes’ “You Keep Me Hanging On,” or the hypnotic gospel piano on Gaye’s “Can I Get a Witness.”

“All the songs started out as slow ballads, but when we were in the studio we’d pick up the tempo,” Dozier told the Guardian in 2001. “The songs had to be fast because they were for teenagers - otherwise it would have been more like something for your parents. The emotion was still there, it was just under cover of the optimism that you got from the up-tempo beat.”

The prime of H-D-H, and of Motown, ended in 1968 amid questions and legal disputes over royalties and other issues. H-D-H left the label, and neither side would recover. The Four Tops and the Supremes were among the acts who suffered from no longer having their most dependable writers. Meanwhile, H-D-H’s efforts to start their own business fell far short of Motown. The labels Invictus and Hot Wax both faded within a few years, and Dozier would recall with disbelief the Hollands’ turning down such future superstars as Al Green and George Clinton. H-D-H did release several hits, including Freda Payne’s “Band of Gold” and Honey Cone’s “Want Ads.”

Holland-Dozier-Holland were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1988 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame two years later. On his own, Dozier had a top 20 hit with “Trying to Hold on to My Woman,” helped produce Aretha Franklin’s “Sweet Passion” album and collaborated with Eric Clapton and Hucknall among others. His biggest success was co-writing Phil Collins’ chart-topping “Two Hearts,” from the 1988 movie “Buster,” a mid-tempo, Motown-style ballad that won a Grammy and Golden Globe and received an Oscar nomination.

H-D-H reunited for a stage production of “The First Wives Club,” which premiered in 2009, but their time back together was brief and unhappy. Dozier and the Hollands clashed often and Dozier dropped out before the show launched. “I can’t see us ever working with Lamont again,” Eddie Holland wrote in “Come and Get These Memories,” a memoir by the Hollands that came out in 2019, the same year Dozier published the memoir “How Sweet It Is.”

Dozier acknowledged that his early success conflicted with his family life, but he eventually settled down with Barbara Ullman, who died in 2021 after more than 40 years of marriage. His children included the songwriter-record producer Beau Dozier and composer Paris Ray Dozier.

Like so many Motown artists, Dozier was born in Detroit and raised in a family of singers and musicians. He sang in the choir of his Baptist church and his love for words was affirmed by a grade school teacher who, he recalled, liked one of his poems so much she kept it on the blackboard for a month. By the late 1950s, he was a professional singer and eventually signed with Motown, where he first worked with Brian Holland, and then Eddie Holland, who wrote most of the lyrics.

Some of Motown’s biggest hits and catchiest phrases originated from Dozier’s domestic life. He remembered his grandfather’s addressing women as “Sugar pie, honey bunch,” the opening words and ongoing refrain of the Four Tops’ “I Can’t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)."" The Four Tops hit “Bernadette” was inspired by all three songwriters having troubles with women named Bernadette, while an argument with another Dozier girlfriend helped inspire a Supremes favorite.

“She was pretty heated up because I was quite the ladies’ man at that time and I’d been cheating on her,” Dozier told the Guardian. “So she started telling me off and swinging at me until I said, ‘Stop! In the name of love!’ And as soon as I’d said it I heard a cash register in my head and laughed. My girlfriend didn’t think it was very amusing: we broke up. The only ones who were happy about it were the Supremes.”

John Leguizamo has spoken out against actor James Franco's casting as Fidel Castro in the upcoming film, ""Alina of Cuba: La Hija Rebelde.""

It was recently announced that Franco will play the late Cuban leader in the new Miguel Bardem-directed movie from Mankind Entertainment, Maven Pictures and Redbud Studios.

""Alina of Cuba"" is based on the real-life story of Alina Fernandez, who is one of Castro's nine known children. Fernandez is known for being critical of the Cuban government and her father's rule. Actress Ana Villafane will star in the film as Alina.

Leguizamo took to Instagram Friday to criticize Franco’s casting as Fidel Castro, sharing a screenshot of Deadline's report confirming Franco's role.

""How is this still going on?"" the Tony- and Emmy-winning actor wrote alongside the screenshot. ""How is Hollywood excluding us but stealing our narratives as well?""

""No more appropriation Hollywood and streamers!"" he continued. ""Boycott! This F'd up! Plus seriously difficult story to tell without aggrandizement which would b wrong! I don't got a prob with Franco but he ain't Latino!""

John Martinez O'Felan, the CEO of Mankind Entertainment, the lead producer and manager of the film, responded to Leguizamo's comments in a lengthy statement to ""Good Morning America.""

He told ""GMA"" that Leguizamo's comments ""lack factual substance"" and ""are a public unfair attack on me and my work.""

""I want to start off my response by saying that I’ve always been a fan of John Leguizamo and looked up to him as one of the early American actors, and still am although saddened,"" his statement began. ""However, I want to point out that his odd comments, if you base them on genealogy, are a blind attack and lack any factual substance.""

He went on, ""For one, let’s take a historical look at true Latinism in today’s mass culture of Hispanics, because a territory does not define a person’s blood trail. What I mean when I say that is that to be 'Latin' means of Hispanic, Portuguese, Italian or Latin American heritage and roots, all of the branches of the root of being 'Latin.' So to me his statements can create a great talking point for our people, because his comments represent the confusion and identity crisis in Hollywood right now within the Hispanic community in America who claim to only identify as Latin.""

""Moreover, I’ve never met Leguizamo but felt the calling to address the fact that he’s attacking me and my work based on false information because I’m actually not Hollywood as he’s insisted: I was born as a 4th generation Hispanic from Texas from an Iberian/ Indigenous Mexican, and have been the visionary behind this project since its beginning,"" O'Felan said.

He added, ""Moreover, I’ve also spent 16 years developing this around and with the support of Ms. Fernandez, and took the time to find a female as the lead with Cuban roots, so he’s also attacking the feminine focus on this title unfairly. This is a film based on a Latin female immigrant living in America who is of historical importance, led by a Latin woman, and I’m just an underdog who is making it, so it’s kind of disappointing to see our work getting attacked by someone we thought would celebrate it. If he hates it and wants to ban it, oh well, I’ll still probably watch his movies because he’s been one of my favorite actors for the last 30 years.""

O'Felan also said that Franco ""takes his work very seriously.""

""He's been an amazing artistic collaborator to work with,"" he said. ""It's also been awesome to watch the actresses character build around him as the perfect antagonist figure in the picture. I can't wait until the audiences see the final result!""

""Alina of Cuba"" will be one of Franco's first roles since he was accused of sexual misconduct by five women in 2018.

Four of the accusers were acting students who attended Franco's Studio 4, a New York- and Los Angeles-based acting school Franco founded in 2014, and one was a mentee of the actor.

Franco agreed to pay just over $2.2 million to settle a lawsuit accusing him and his associates of sexual exploitation situations and fraud in 2021. He continued to deny the allegations against him.

The bottom line is this: 2022 is expected to be the most expensive school shopping experience to date.","August marks the beginning of school for millions of families. But this year, back-to-school shopping may be more stressful than ever before. With consumers already too familiar with increasing rates of inflation, over half of all families are concerned that it will impact their school supply costs, according to Deloitte.

It's no surprise that this year will be the most expensive back-to-school shopping season on record. According to a survey from the National Retail Federation, families are expecting to pay anywhere from $860 per student to $1,200 depending on their child's level of education. For families with students in elementary through high school, the estimated cost is $864, up $15 from last year.

For those looking to save, there are some strategies to help beat inflation and cut costs.

Buy in bulk with friends

One tactic that saves consumers boatloads is to buy in bulk. That means going to Costco, Staples or an online retailer and buying larger quantities of products for a lower per unit price. For example, you can get a box of 300 pencils for $29.99 on Amazon, giving you a pencil that is five or six times cheaper than writing utensils that are sold in smaller packages.

But beware of overbuying. Consider pairing up with a neighbor or friends to split the bulk order, so you don't buy more than you need and still score supplies like pens, pencils, notebooks or paper at a fraction of the price.

Reuse and swap with others

Quantity isn't the only way to save money. Knowing the industry can help influence how you shop. For example, 64,000 tons of textbooks get thrown away each year. Facebook Marketplace and Facebook's Free and For Sale sections often showcase the best cheap and free school supplies in your area. Not only will you be saving cash, you'll also be saving the environment. A win-win!

Shop during tax-free weekends

Finally, get all caught up on when your state's tax day is and what products are exempt from sales tax.

Not sure how to find that information? ""Good Morning America"" has you covered.

State-by-state list of tax-free holidays for back-to-school supplies in 2022

In addition, Illinois is offering a reduced sales tax of 1.25% on school supplies from Aug. 5-14.

For other ways to save, check cash-back apps such as Ibotta and Rakuten for deals. For computers and electronics, look for refurbished models, buy from certified sellers, check return policies and comparison shop.

The bottom line is this: 2022 is expected to be the most expensive school shopping experience to date. When gas prices, grocery prices and rent are all similarly expensive and some experts predict an extended recession in 2023, every dollar counts.

Keep the above tips in mind, and you might just make it out with a little cash left in your wallet.

The film stars horror movie veteran Kevin Bacon as the sinister director of a so-called ""conversion therapy"" camp, where LGBTQ+ teens find themselves being hunted by a mysterious masked killer.

Speaking with ABC Audio about the new movie, which first premiered at the Outfest film festival in July before hitting Peacock on Friday, Bacon said he was a bit surprised when writer and director John Logan pitched him the role.

""He called me up and he said, 'You know, I actually wrote this part for you in mind,' and I read it and was like, 'Thanks a lot, pal!'"" the actor shared with a laugh.

But once he heard Logan's vision for the story, he said he was sold.

""He really touched me with the notion that he wanted a young person who was feeling outside, who was feeling different, who was feeling bullied or feeling closeted or whatever, to be able to find the movie, and feel a sense of empowerment and maybe see a character that they could relate to up on a screen in a way that hadn't been delivered before,"" Bacon explained.

By packaging it in a genre people love -- horror -- Bacon said he hopes they can reach a wide audience and maybe change some minds.

""Hopefully we reach those kids who I described before, but also hopefully we reach people who do click on it because it is a horror movie and maybe think that maybe gay conversion isn't all that bad, and they can possibly change their mind about this and get a different kind of perspective,"" he said. ""That would be the real win.""

""Conversion therapy"" is defined as any effort that aims to change a person’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. It has been denounced by most mainstream medical organizations as dangerous, and has been shown to be harmful to LGBTQ+ people who are subjected to it.

How long do tape-in hair extensions last and how are they removed?","When it comes to hair extensions, there are many, many options.

The latest obsession comes in tape-in form.

Tape-in hair extensions are sections of hair that are pre-taped with medical-grade glue by a licensed cosmetologist. This kind of install is perfect for anyone looking for extra length, fullness and maximum versatility -- along with minimal tension.

""I think tape-in extensions have grown in popularity because there have been more stylists promoting it on Black hair,"" Dallas-based natural hair and extension specialist Jayla Hamilton told ""Good Morning America.""

""There's something about the way you can tape extensions on natural hair,"" she said. ""It's very interesting to see.""

While there are thousands of tape-in videos on TikTok and Instagram, it's important to know the expert do's, don'ts and best practices if you are looking to try this type of extension.

Hamilton, who services clients daily, explained what you should remember when booking an appointment.

Pros and cons of getting tape-in hair extensions

Available in a wide variety of hair textures, ranging from pin straight to tightly curled, one of the pros of getting tape-ins is that you can achieve natural-looking extensions with length and volume, minus any tension. ""There is no braiding, sewing, or gluing involved,"" said Hamilton.

She also pointed out that if you were to pull your hair up in a ponytail, the extensions would lay flat and seamless.

""Tape-ins really stand out because people are so intrigued by the fact that you are literally taping hair to your head,"" Hamilton said. ""I know some of my clients are amazed that I can shampoo their hair without the tapes sliding out. You can also reuse the extensions depending on the quality of the hair.""

When it comes to the cons, one of the most significant is that tape-ins are a temporary style -- and routine salon maintenance is vital. ""If your tape-ins are not taken care of properly, it can cause matting and breakage,"" said Hamilton.

What happens during a tape-in hair consultation?

""During a consultation, I always ask my clients what they are looking for when it comes to tape-in extensions,"" said Hamilton. ""My clients wear their hair straightened, so I personally do not texture match with this install, though some stylists do.""

""I ask my clients how they feel about their curl pattern stretching over time,"" she continued. ""The majority do not mind it, but if they prefer not to have their hair straightened, I can't proceed with the install. I let them know what maintenance entails, the cost, and when they should be removed.""

Who is a good candidate for tape-in hair extensions?

The best candidate for a tape-in service is someone with enough hair to cover or disguise the tape, ""at least bob length,"" suggested Hamilton. Both fine or coarse hair types are safe for tape-in extensions, but anyone experiencing extreme shedding or scalp issues such as seborrheic dermatitis should not try this type of install.

Hamilton also affirmed that if you are not willing to come back to the salon for maintenance or follow the at-home care instructions from your stylist, tape-ins may not be an ideal option to try.

Tape-in installation process

Step 1: Tape-in hair services start with shampooing, conditioning, blow drying, straightening and trimming the hair.

Step 2: A sandwich-like method is used on quarter-inch subsections of hair. The tape is placed under each section (not too close to the scalp), smoothed down, and another tape is placed on top and smoothed down.

Step 3: The stylist will tap the tape with a hair iron on low heat to seal it before following this bricklayer pattern in rows around your head.

Maintenance tips

When maintaining your tape-in install, it's best to brush and wrap the hair every day. ""I would not recommend oiling or greasing the scalp because it could cause the tape-ins to slip,"" said Hamilton.

Pro tip: If you feel like your hair is getting too dirty before your next appointment, use a dry shampoo to aid in reducing the greasy feel or look of your hair.

Tape-ins vs. microlinks

Last year, ""GMA"" reported on the craze around microlink hair extensions which are tiny sections of hair that are seamlessly grouped together and secured with a micro-ring or micro-bead using a hair plier. This install has a similar result as tape-ins, but there are clear differences.

""Microlinks give you length and fullness while tape-ins give you length and volume,"" said Hamilton. She also highlighted that microlinks will last longer than tape-in extensions.

How long do tape-in hair extensions last and how are they removed?

Tape-ins can last six to 10 weeks with proper maintenance and at-home care. To remove, use a tape-in removal spray, which can be found at beauty supply stores or mass retailers such as Amazon, to loosen the adhesive and make it easy for the natural hair to be separated from the tape.

Price range

Prices tend to vary depending on added treatments and how many tapes are used, but the typical cost can range from $300-$600.

Clients with fine hair generally need 40-60 tape strips, medium thick hair needs 50-70 strips and thick hair needs 60-80 strips."

The actress, who played Gloria, the New Jersey-based best friend to Piper Perabo's Violet, got candid with The Hollywood Reporter mentioning how all of the women from the 2000 hit movie were given negative feedback about their bodies.

""There were already people putting a lot of Spanx on me in wardrobe fittings and being very disappointed when they saw me, the costume designer being like, 'Nobody told me there would be girls like you,'"" Lynskey told the magazine. ""Really intense feedback about my physicality, my body, people doing my makeup and being like, 'I'm just going to help you out by giving you a bit more of a jawline and stuff.'

Earlier this year, Lynskey revealed another alleged body shaming incident she faced while starring in ""Yellowjackets."" She told Rolling Stone that someone from the series implied that she should lose weight.

""They were asking me, 'What do you plan to do? I'm sure the producers will get you a trainer. They'd love to help you with this,'"" she said.

Following the incident, several of her co-stars, including Juliette Lewis, came to her defense, and a letter was written to the show's producers.

""It was really important to me for [Shauna] to not ever comment on my body, to not have me putting a dress on and being like, 'I wish I looked a bit better,'"" said Lynskey. ""I did find it important that this character is just comfortable and sexual and not thinking or talking about it, because I want women to be able to watch it and be like, 'Wow, she looks like me and nobody's saying she's the fat one.' That representation is important.""

In response to McCurdy, her ""iCarly"" co-star, Cosgrove, told The New York Times she was ""unaware"" of what McCurdy was experiencing.","She reflects on emotional abuse she says she experienced during her upbringing.

Jennette McCurdy, who is known for her role as Sam in the popular teen sitcoms ""iCarly"" and ""Sam & Cat,"" is opening up about what she says was the dark reality behind the fame and glamour of her television days and experiencing abuse from her late mother.

In her new memoir, ""I'm Glad My Mom Died,"" the former TV star reflects on the emotional abuse she says she experienced during her upbringing with her mother, Debbie, who died from cancer in 2013.

McCurdy, 30, writes about her mother's controlling habits, from calorie counting McCurdy's food -- which she says triggered eating disorders for the ""iCarly"" star -- to her mom giving her showers until she was a teenager.

The actress spoke about how writing the memoir altered her perspective toward her mother during an appearance on ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday.

""Grief for me toward my mom used to be really complicated,"" she explained. ""I'd feel angry and confused at why I felt angry that I was grieving her.""

""I felt like she didn't deserve my tears and my sadness since she was abusive, but it simplified in a really relieving way and now feels like I'm able to just miss her and I think that is only possible because of the healing that happened through the writing of the book,"" she added.

When asked if she misses her late mother, McCurdy said she does at times. However, she admitted that she would not have written the memoir if her mother was still alive, as she believes she would still have her ""identity dictated by her.""

She also addressed the book's particularly pointed title, saying she understands it's not for everyone but feels that those who have also experienced abuse from their parents will understand it.

""I get that it's attention-grabbing but it's also something that I mean sincerely,"" she explained on naming her book, ""I'm Glad My Mom Died.""

""I'm not saying it at all in a flippant way and while the response might be divided, I really appreciate the positivity that I received from a lot of people and the support that I received from a lot of people,"" she continued.

She went on, ""I think that anybody who has experienced parental abuse understands this title and I think anybody who has a sense of humor understands this title. And I'm not so concerned with the opinions of anybody else because this book is not for them.""

In the memoir, McCurdy also alleges that one person, whom she refers to only as ""the creator,"" offered her alcohol when she was underage and that he gave her a back massage.

When ""Sam & Cat"" was canceled after only one season, McCurdy writes in her book that Nickelodeon attempted to arrange a $300,0000 ""thank you"" parting gift for her only if she agreed to never publicly speak about her experiences at the network. McCurdy said in her book that she didn't accept the money.

When asked on ""GMA"" about that specific allegation that Nickelodeon offered her money, McCurdy directed people to read the book.

""I've seen a lot of headlines about the book and I'm really glad the book is receiving a lot of attention -- that's awesome, that's wonderful,"" she said. ""What I will say is that the book is so much more than that. My book is so much more, it cannot be reduced to a headline, my life nor this book can be reduced to a headline.""

""I have said everything that I want to say about that in the book,"" she continued when asked again if the network offered her the money. ""I hope that anybody whose attention might be piqued by these headlines will consider reading the book because I've said everything in as articulate and thoughtful of a way as I can manage in that book.""

McCurdy said she took a year and a half writing ""I'm Glad My Mom Died,"" working through 12 drafts in the process.

After ""iCarly"" ended in 2012 and ""Sam & Cat"" ended in 2014, McCurdy went on to star in the Netflix science-fiction series ""Between."" When that series ended in 2016, McCurdy took a break from acting.

McCurdy previously told The New York Times that she started writing a few personal essays a few years ago, including some about her mom, and began performing a one-woman show by the same name as her memoir in Los Angeles.

In 2021, McCurdy confirmed that she wouldn't be joining the ""iCarly"" reboot, which stars Miranda Cosgrove, and said she has retired from acting.

In response to McCurdy, her ""iCarly"" co-star, Cosgrove, told The New York Times she was ""unaware"" of what McCurdy was experiencing.

""When you're young, you're so in your own head,"" Cosgrove told The New York Times. ""You can't imagine that people around you are having much harder struggles. You don't expect things like that from the person in the room who's making everyone laugh.""

When asked on ""GMA"" what her advice is to those who are struggling on the inside, McCurdy encouraged those people to ""make contact with that struggle.""

""I really believe you have to face the parts of yourself -- for me facing the parts of myself that I felt the most shame about, facing those and becoming public with those has been really healing for me and transformative, so I hope people consider that for themselves,"" she said.

McCurdy said she hopes her memoir will inspire others to ""share some of those uncomfortable truths about themselves.""

""I put all of myself into this book, 110% of myself, and I said a lot of things, a lot of uncomfortable truths that are, I think, difficult things to say,"" she said on ""GMA.""

""The more uncomfortable something was for me to put on the page, the more important it felt for me to put on the page,"" she continued. ""That kind of honesty has been truly liberating for me and has led me to a life of fulfillment and authenticity that I hope for everybody so I hope that people take away the honesty and are maybe inspired to share some of those uncomfortable truths about themselves.""

Nickelodeon told ""GMA"" it has no comment. ""We have no reportable response other than a no comment at this time,"" Nickelodeon wrote in a statement."

Ashton Kutcher says he's ""lucky to be alive"" after he says he developed vasculitis, a rare condition..

In a first look from Monday night's new episode of National Geographic's ""Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge"" from Access Hollywood, the ""Punk'd"" creator opened up to the British adventurer about developing a rare disorder, while the two walked through the jungles of Costa Rica.

""Two years ago, I had this weird, super rare form of vasculitis,"" Kutcher said. ""It knocked out my vision, it knocked out my hearing -- it knocked out all my equilibrium. It took me, like, a year to build it all back up.""

While Kutcher did not mention what specific disorder he had, vasculitis is generally defined as swelling that affects the walls of your blood vessels, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Also known as angiitis or arteritis, some cases of vasculitis may be caused by autoimmune disorders that occur ""when your immune hurts your blood vessels by mistake,"" according to the institute.

The National Institutes of Health said it's unknown what happens, but when it does, the blood vessels swell and can close off. Symptoms can vary depending on what kind of vasculitis a person has, but general symptoms include tiredness, fever, aches and pains, loss of appetite and weight loss, according to the NIH.

Vasculitis can also cause ear and nose problems, eye problems, genital ulcers, heart palpitations, joint pain, lung problems, nerve issues, skin rashes or swollen, dry lips or tongue, according to the NIH. Treatment can include prescription medicines or over-the-counter pain medication to relieve symptoms and reduce inflammation, the agency said.

""You don't really appreciate it until it's gone, until you go, 'I don't know if I'm ever gonna be able to see again. I don't know if I'm ever gonna be able to hear again. I don't know if I'm ever gonna be able to walk again,'"" Kutcher told Grylls in the clip.

He added, ""The minute you start seeing your obstacles as things that are made for you, to give you what you need, then life starts to get fun, right? You start surfing on top of your problems instead of living underneath them.""

The new episode of ""Running Wild with Bear Grylls,"" premieres Monday night at 9 p.m. ET on National Geographic. In clips teasing the new episode on social media, Kutcher is seen pushing himself to the limit as Grylls takes him through the Costa Rican jungle and crossing a ravine. Clips also show Grylls pranking Kutcher about crocodiles in a river as they look for fish to eat.

You can watch Kutcher's adventure on Disney+ starting Aug. 10.

Kutcher tweeted Monday night confirming that he experienced a rare form of vasculitis.

""Before there are a bunch of rumors/chatter/whatever out there. Yes, I had a rare vasculitis episode 3 yrs ago,"" he said. ""(Autoimmune flare up) I had some impairments hear, vision, balance issues right after.""

He added that he's putting it behind him and looking forward to what's next.

""I fully recovered,"" Kutcher said. ""All good. Moving on. See you at the 2022 NY Marathon w/Thorn.""

Pesto pasta salad

Ingredients for pesto pasta salad. Kylie Mazon-Chambers

Prep time: 15 minutes

Servings: 6

Ingredients

1/2 pound farfalle pasta

8 ounces baby spinach

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1/2 cup fresh basil pesto, (recipe below)

1 (10-ounce) jar sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped

8 ounces fresh mozzarella Ciliegine

1 cup halved cherry tomatoes

1/4 cup packed fresh basil leaves

Kosher salt, as needed

Freshly ground black pepper, as needed

For the pesto

6 ounces fresh basil leaves

1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

1/2 cup toasted pine nuts

3 cloves garlic sliced

1/2 medium lemon juiced

1 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt, as needed

Freshly ground black pepper, as needed

Directions

For the pesto: Pick the basil leaves off the stems then rinse and pat the basil dry. Place the basil, Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, garlic and lemon juice in a blender or food processor fitted with a blade attachment and blend. Stop the blender or food processor and stir occasionally, scraping down the sides, to make sure all ingredients are combined. Add olive oil and pulse once more. The mixture should still be slightly chunky.

Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium high heat. Cook the pasta until just al dente, about 8 minutes.

Arrange the spinach at the bottom of a colander then drain the pasta over the top so the spinach wilts.

Add the pasta and spinach to a large bowl, then toss them in the oil and pesto until combined while the pasta is still warm.

Next, add the sun-dried tomatoes, mozzarella, cherry tomatoes and fresh basil. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve at room temperature or chilled.

1800’s:

Connecticut was the first U.S. state to make abortion a criminal offense. This was codified in a state statute in 1821 that punished any person who provided or took poison or “other noxious and destructive substance” with the intent to cause “the miscarriage of any woman, then being quick with child.”

Anti-abortion rights advocate Dr. Horatio Storer is pictured in an undated photo. Published in the book ""Biographical Sketch of Dr. Horatio J. Storer,"" 1855.

In 1857, anti-abortion rights advocate and women’s reproductive health pioneer Dr. Horatio Storer helped start the movement which would later be called the Physicians’ Crusade Against Abortion. Later that year, he led a committee to investigate what he called criminal abortions in the state of Massachusetts, proposing that abortion in all instances was a criminal act and that the law did not go far enough to punish that alleged crime. His actions are considered largely responsible for the increase in law criminalizing abortion in the late 1800s.

The Comstock Act of 1873 made it illegal to send “obscene, lewd or lascivious,” “immoral,” or “indecent” publications through the mail. This included sending any materials containing information connected to contraception or abortions.

1900’s:

By the 1900s, abortion was illegal in every state. The laws varied from state to state, with some allowing for abortion to protect the woman’s life or to terminate pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.

1920’s to 1940's

In 1921, Margaret Sanger founded the American Birth Control League; the organization would become the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942.

Throughout the Depression years abortions are believed to have increased due to the higher levels of maternal deaths at this time. Countless women died as a result of botched abortions; underground abortion clinics were raided, and doctors arrested.

1950’s

1955 Planned Parenthood held a conference titled “Abortion in the United States.” Which included testimony from sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, Dr. G. Lotrell Timanus and Planned Parenthod’s then-medical director Mary Calderone. A record of the conference is published in 1958, launching a national discussion on reformed abortion laws.

1960’s

The arrival of the Equal Rights Movement to the political stage included a push to demand more rights for women. Legal access to contraception and abortion were on the agenda. President John F. Kennedy formed the Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW) which was established to advise the President of the United States on issues concerning women.

There were many advances toward abortion rights in the 1960s include the establishment of The Society for Human Abortion in San Francisco in 1963, which challenged the law by openly providing information on abortion and conception.

In 1967, Colorado became the first state to decriminalize abortion in cases of rape, incest, or in which pregnancy would lead to permanent physical disability of the woman. Similar laws were later passed in California, Oregon and North Carolina.

1970’s

Individual states continued to expand abortion rights throughout the United States. Hawaii became the first state to fully legalize abortions at the request of the woman in 1970. In the same year, New York allowed abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy and similar laws were soon passed in Alaska and Washington.

In 1971, the groundbreaking court case known as Roe v. Wade was brought in front of the Supreme Court. An unmarried pregnant woman from Texas referred to in court documents as “Jane Roe” challenged a state law that makes it illegal for a doctor to perform an abortion unless a woman’s life is at stake. The woman was later identified as Norma McCorvey.

By the end of 1972, 13 states had more inclusive abortion laws similar to those passed in Colorado in 1967, while Mississippi allowed abortion in cases of rape or incest only, and Alabama and Massachusetts allowed abortions only in cases where the woman's physical health was endangered. During this period, women seeking an abortion would often travel to a state where abortion was legal to undergo the procedure.

In 1973 the Supreme Court decision in the Roe v. Wade case ruled in favor of Roe and abortion was legalized throughout the United States.

In 1976, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, banning the use of Medicaid and other federal funds for abortions.

1980’s

In 1981, with the Bellotti v. Baird case, the Supreme Court ruled that pregnant minors can petition the court for permission to have an abortion without parental notification.

With the Webster v. Reproductive Health Services case, heard in 1989, the Supreme Court upheld a Missouri law that imposed restrictions on the use of state funds, facilities, and employees in performing, assisting with, or counseling abortions. This allowed for states to legislate in a way that had previously been thought to be illegal under Roe v Wade.

1990’s

President Bill Clinton signed the Freedom of Access to Clinics Act, on May 26, 1994. The Act makes it a federal crime to physically obstruct the entrance to a clinic or to use force, the threat of force, or physical obstruction, such as a sit-in, to interfere with, injure, or intimidate clinic workers or women seeking abortions or other reproductive health services.

In 1995, Congress passed the HR 1833 Bill, also know as Partial-Birth Abortion Act, which makes it illegal for any doctor to knowingly perform a partial-birth abortion except when necessary to save the mother’s life.

However, on April 10 of the following year, President Bill Clinton vetoed the 1995 Partial-Birth Abortion Act preventing it from coming into law.

2000’s

President George W. Bush signed the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, on Aug. 5, 2002, affirming legal protection to an infant born alive after a failed attempt at induced abortion.

The following year, the House approved the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush on Nov. 5, 2003.

In 2016, the Supreme Court made a ruling on the Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt case. The final decision dictated that Texas could not place restrictions on abortion services that create an undue burden for women seeking an abortion.

2022

In May, 2022, a leaked draft opinion by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito indicated that the Court would strike down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which guaranteed federal constitutional protections of abortion rights.

Have You Seen This Man?

On a brisk day in November 1998, a doughy balding Brooklyn computer salesman was supposed to report to prison to begin serving a 17-year sentence. He rented a Ford Taurus. Drove to Queens to turn in the ankle monitor he had been wearing. He took $600 out of an ATM. Headed to JFK airport. And vanished. His name was John Ruffo. The crime he had committed was outlandish. Using forged documents and fake corporate seals, he persuaded banks to loan him $350 million. He invented a nonexistent proposition that he called “Project Star” and he used the money to gamble the millions on the stock market, becoming one of Wall Street’s high-rollers. When the FBI caught wind of his swindle, they set up a sting. At his sentencing, prosecutors made an unthinkable mistake. They agreed to let John Ruffo drive himself to prison. What followed was one of the longest and most challenging manhunts in the history of the U.S. Marshals Service. We discover a man whose life was a hall of mirrors. Secret identities, unlikely affiliations, and bogus companies are uncovered. Was he secretly helping an elite unit of FBI spy-hunters lure Soviet scientists to defect? Did he cut a deal with the mob to help him disappear? Was that him, seated behind home plate at Dodger Stadium? We join the chase as the Marshals try and resolve a case that has baffled and bewildered generations of their colleagues, crossing the globe to ask one pressing question: Have you seen this man?"
