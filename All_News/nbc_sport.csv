I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.
Her first singles tournament back was this year’s Wimbledon, where she lost in the first round to 115th-ranked Frenchwoman Harmony Tan.
'” Williams wrote.
She also won singles gold at the 2012 London Games.","Serena Williams will retire from tennis some time after the U.S. Open that starts in three weeks.

“I have never liked the word retirement,” she wrote in a Vogue article. “It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me. I’ve been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people. Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.

“There comes a time in life when we have to decide to move in a different direction. That time is always hard when you love something so much. My goodness do I enjoy tennis. But now, the countdown has begun. I have to focus on being a mom, my spiritual goals and finally discovering a different, but just exciting Serena. I’m gonna relish these next few weeks.”

Williams, 40, did not write specifically in the article that the U.S. Open will be her last tournament, but all signs point to it at least being her last major.

Williams owns 23 Grand Slam singles titles, one shy of Margaret Court‘s record. Court, the 1960s and ’70s Australian star, won 11 Australian Opens when many of the world’s top players did not play the event. Most of her titles came before all of the world’s best players gathered for each of the four majors.

“There are people who say I’m not the GOAT because I didn’t pass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles, which she achieved before the ‘open era’ that began in 1968,” Williams wrote. “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want that record. Obviously I do. But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her.”

Williams went nearly a year between tournament play after withdrawing from her 2021 Wimbledon first-round match with a right hamstring tear. Her first singles tournament back was this year’s Wimbledon, where she lost in the first round to 115th-ranked Frenchwoman Harmony Tan.

“There’s a fan fantasy that I might have tied Margaret that day in London [at Wimbledon this year], then maybe beat her record in New York, and then at the trophy ceremony say, ‘See ya!'” Williams wrote. “I get that. It’s a good fantasy. But I’m not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment.”

Williams finished runner-up at four majors since returning from 2017 life-threatening childbirth — at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2018 and 2019. Her last major title came while eight weeks pregnant at the 2017 Australian Open.

“In the last year, [husband] Alexis [Ohanian] and I have been trying to have another child, and we recently got some information from my doctor that put my mind at ease and made me feel that whenever we’re ready, we can add to our family,” she wrote. “I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete. I need to be two feet into tennis or two feet out.

“I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don’t think it’s fair. If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family.

“But these days, if I have to choose between building my tennis résumé and building my family, I choose the latter.”

Williams won her first-round match in a U.S. Open lead-up tournament in Toronto on Monday. She is expected to play her next match Wednesday. Players at the tournament commented on the news, including 18-year-old Coco Gauff.

“Not really shocking but almost shocking news because she’s just been playing forever, my whole life,” said Gauff, who was born four and a half years after Williams’ first major singles title. “The legacy that she’s left through her tennis career is something that I don’t think any other player can probably touch.

“I grew up watching her. I mean, that’s the reason why I play tennis. Tennis being a predominantly white sport, it definitely helped a lot because I saw somebody who looked like me dominating the game, and it made me believe that I could dominate, too.”

Williams said she is “getting there” mentally and feeling much better in practice physically.

“It’s just getting that to the court,” she said in Toronto on Monday. “I’m the kind of person it just takes one or two things and then it clicks, so I’m just waiting for that to click.”

Her first major singles title came at the U.S. Open in 1999 at age 17. The next year, she won the first of three Olympic doubles titles with older sister Venus. She also won singles gold at the 2012 London Games.

“There is no happiness in this topic for me,” she wrote of retirement. “I know it’s not the usual thing to say, but I feel a great deal of pain. It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine. I hate it. I hate that I have to be at this crossroads. I keep saying to myself, I wish it could be easy for me, but it’s not. I’m torn: I don’t want it to be over, but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next.”

I think that’s just a part of loving to compete and hating to lose maybe more than you love to win.","CINCINNATI — I hear this a lot, or something like it, from family and from friends in the business:

Why do you still go on that training-camp trip? Killing yourself, zipping from camp to camp. You’re 65 now. Cut it back.

This story is why.

The Lead: Ja'Marr Chase

What separates the great players from the very good players? I saw it the other day on a lonely field in the Midwest under a summer afternoon broiler, 92 degrees with 85 percent humidity, when the 2021 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year was the only football player at work.

Ja’Marr Chase was the last of 90 players on the field for the AFC champion Bengals on this dog-day Cincinnati afternoon, prepping to catch footballs shot out of a Jugs machine at short range at 40 mph. Chase started catching them with running back Chris Evans providing some distracting defense to make the catches tougher, but then Evans had to hustle inside for a meeting. So now, other than one other Bengal signing autographs 100 yards away for a few fans, and two equipment guys, the place was Bengal-free. Players and coaches were inside the air-conditioned locker room and offices.

Chase now had one problem: He needed a DB to play defense. He saw the stoop-shouldered boss of Bengals.com, Geoff Hobson, waiting for him to finish the drill so he could ask him a few questions. Hobson asked if Chase needed him to play defense.

“If you want to,” Chase said.

In his last football game, the Super Bowl, Chase was guarded by all-world corner Jalen Ramsey.

Now he’d be guarded by a gray-haired 63-year-old scribe who last played football in the Carter administration.

The object of this drill was not only for Chase to work on catching line-drive throws, but to have someone distract him with a tug on the jersey or wave a white Gatorade towel in his face. Hobson grabbed a towel and prepared to distract Chase from catching fastballs from the machine, just eight yards away.

“Wave it in front of my eyes,” Chase told Hobson.

“THWAP!” came the footballs, one after another, shot out of the machine, a Bengals aide handing them to equipment manager Adam Knollman, who fed them into the machine, each ball speeding 24 feet to the orange-gloved Chase. With Hobson fluttering the towel as each line drive zipped toward them, Chase softly hand-caught them, no body involved. Try that sometime.

The oversized rolling garbage can was empty. I called from the sideline: “How many in there?”

Equipment guy: “Well, about 40 in each.”

“I do three of ‘em,” Chase said. Most of the receivers and backs do one of these huge cans.

One hundred twenty balls. Twenty minutes of footballs shot out of a cannon. Hobson fluttering the towel in his face, no words spoken. Once, Hobson succeeded, distracting Chase so the ball clanged off his hands. (“I can tell my grandchildren I broke up a pass intended for Ja’Marr Chase,” Hobson said later.) Chase stopped the drill, ambled 25 yards downfield, picked it up and tossed it back to the assistant helping Knollman feed the machine with ball after ball.

Seemed an odd thing, Chase chasing the errant ball. Let that one go, I thought. Someone will pick it up later.

“Ja’Marr’s different,” Knollman, the equipment guy, said. “If he misses one, he’ll go get it, and the ball gets thrown back to us. He’ll have to do it again. He has to be perfect. He has to catch every one.”

When it was over, Chase took his helmet off. The sweat flowed in rivulets off his head. “Thank you,” he said to the equipment guys. A walk-through hour to get today’s script of plays down, two hours of practice, a five-minute “Get Better” period of catching tennis balls thrown fast, then 20 minutes of this.

We’d talked before practice. I asked him what he’d say to a kid watching this interview.

“Focus on you,” Chase said. “There’s so much you can control. If you want to be great, you’ve got to work at it constantly, every day, even when you’re tired. Gotta know when to push yourself, gotta know when to over-push yourself.”

This was over-pushing himself. It’s his world.

I said to him pre-practice: “You want to be the best, don’t you?”

“That’s my goal,” Chase said.

“No questions?”

“No questions.”

“What about you against [former LSU mate] Justin Jefferson?”

“I’m better than Justin.”

“Davante Adams?”

“I don’t know if I’m better … but I watch his film all the time. He told me he watches my film. That’s definitely something to keep me working.”

One day last week, Chase’s receivers coach, Troy Walters, used Powerpoint before practice to put up a quote from Bo Schembechler in the wide receivers meeting room.

EVERY DAY YOU’RE EITHER GETTING BETTER OR YOU’RE GETTING WORSE. YOU NEVER STAY THE SAME.

The same day, at practice, Walters, who has been significant in Chase’s growth and ethos, told him: “If you want to be really great, you need to be fundamentally sound every day, even in our walk-through.” Walters noticed on one route that Chase was supposed to take four steps off the line, but instead he took five. He admonished Chase. For the rest of the walk-through, Chase would look back at Walters after practicing a route, to see if he’d done it perfectly.

Chase credits Walters with pushing him and polishing him. After Chase had one of the best rookie seasons by a player in recent history—81 catches, 1,455 yards, 18.0 yards per catch, 13 TDs, then a rookie-record 368 postseason receiving yards—what happened a year ago in his rookie training camp seems so incongruous. Remember when he was dropping everything in sight last summer? Walters sat Chase down, showed him tape of how great he was at LSU and said, essentially, this too shall pass, and hard work will fix everything.

“We had a heart to heart,” Walters said. “He’s a great player. The word that comes to mind is freakish. But he understands the value of work, and how important it is in his success. I think what happened is he hadn’t played in the [2020] Covid season, and he just had some rust.”

There’s a drill Walters does with Chase that makes a lot of sense. Chase faces a wall. Walters stands behind him. With Chase focused on the wall, Walters throws a tennis ball hard. It bounces off the wall to a different place in Chase’s catch radius each time, and Chase tries to react instantaneously and grab it.

“Hand-eye coordination,” Chase told me. “Reaction in a split-second is crucial to being great.”

I didn’t sense a lot of the-missed-Super Bowl-chance haunts us out of the Bengals. My theory: This team won fortunate dogfights at Tennessee and Kansas City when Ryan Tannehill and Patrick Mahomes threw late picks, and Evan McPherson kicked 95-yard field goals in both games to get Cincinnati to the big game. I didn’t sense that losing to that great defensive front and Matthew Stafford/Cooper Kupp is a nightmare for Cincinnati going forward. For the Bengals to get to a second straight Super Bowl, the retooled offensive line needs to build a better shield around Joe Burrow (72 sacks in 21 games, by far the most in football). Chase, Tee Higgins and Tyler Boyd combined for 222 catches, 3,374 yards and 24 TDs last year. It’s absurd to just say, Duplicate that, or do better, but the Bengals need a healthy, full dose of their trio to be great again. Because now the rest of the league looks at the Bengals on the schedule as a challenge, not a bye week.

There’s another reason the uber-popular Chase is particularly valuable to the franchise in a time when the Bengals have taken over the local sports scene: perspective beyond his 22 years. The other day, Knollman said to Chase he appreciated him signing autographs for so many kids after practice.

“These people wait a long time for this,” Chase said. “And it doesn’t last forever.”

Many topics after a full week on the road. I was joined by my NBC producer/videographer team of Kelsey Bartels and Morgan Miller and — surprise! — by new NBC teammate Jason Garrett for weekend stops. Started in Cincinnati Monday. Ended with a Sunday drive to St. Joseph, Mo., for Kansas City camp today. In this week’s column:

Aaron Rodgers, in a don’t-worry-be-happy state these days, tells me about his mind-bending trip to Peru experiencing psychedelic substances…and that’s not even the most significant story in Green Bay, IMO.

Deshaun Watson got off easy, but probably not for long.

The NFL had to hammer Stephen Ross, who I think was fortunate too. But the reverberations, involving Tom Brady and Bryce Young and how the NFL sausage is made, are many.

Tend to your mental health, says Ryan Tannehill. He should know. Mike Vrabel: “We spend a lot of time in this game on our bodies. We need to spend as much time on our minds.”

Matt Eberflus has such a good approach to a historic job in Chicago (and you’ll see it). Now we’ll see if Justin Fields can get the Bears back to goodness.

RIP Vin Scully, the greatest to ever grace a baseball booth. Thankful he had a dalliance with football.

Hall of Fame thoughts, and a good reminder from a voter about what’s important.

Packers camp 10

GREEN BAY—In 11 minutes at his locker inside Lambeau Field, Aaron Rodgers used the word “love” 20 times in a 1,597-word conversation. He relayed a recent exchange with veteran teammate Randall Cobb. “He was saying I was such a more gentle person,” Rodgers said with a slight grin that didn’t go away while we spoke. “I said yeah, I love myself a lot better so it’s easier to love other people and give them forgiveness and not jump on somebody’s ass if they make a mistake.”

Of all the things I never thought I’d be writing about covering the NFL, the reigning MVP having a three-day experience with the Quechuan natives in South America ingesting psychedelics would be high on the list. Now that I’ve got your attention, can I interrupt that for a second with a prediction about the 2022 Packers?

I think the addition of new special-teams coach Rich Bisaccia will be more significant to this Green Bay season than the subtraction of a great wide receiver, Davante Adams.

(Maybe it’s me on those psychedelics.)

I think that because history shows Rodgers figures out his targets every year, even when things look dire, and early camp star Romeo Doubs looks like a major early contributor at receiver. In the practice I saw, Doubs physically bested corner Eric Stokes on a long gain over the middle, made a diving catch in a two-minute period and made two other impressive contested catches. The 132nd pick in the draft from Nevada is long and appears unafraid, and the respect he’s getting from defenders was impressive to see. Twice after Doubs torched a DB, others DBs came and tapped him on the helmet, like, We see you, Rook.

Re Bisaccia: The Packers have had lethally bad special teams in recent years—they lost the divisional playoff game to San Francisco last year because of them—and now they have one of the best kicking-team coaches in the game with the addition of the interim Raiders coach last year. Bisaccia’s impact will be huge.

Now…let’s discuss ayahuasca. That was the talk of camp. First I had to learn what ayahuasca is. Per Wikipedia, it is consumed mostly as a tea to promote a placid state of being, and can be done over days: “People who have consumed ayahuasca report having mystical experiences and spiritual revelations regarding their purpose on earth, the true nature of the universe, and deep insight into how to be the best person they possibly can…Westerners typically describe experiences with psychological terms like ‘ego death.’”

I thought of different ways to present this, but then I re-read Rodgers’ words to me, and it’s such an unusual story that I decided to let him tell it. Slightly condensed, here it is, from Rodgers:

“I have a dear friend that I’ve known for 25 years that went on an ayahuasca journey in 2019. He came back, and we played golf one day and he told me all about it. I said, okay, I think it’s time that I do it. So we put together a trip to Peru [in 2020] and had a great experience. Then I went again this offseason and had another beautiful experience. Different, very different. Different size group, different amount of days.

“We sat three different nights with the medicine. I came in with an intention of doing a lot of healing of other relationships and bringing in certain people to have conversations with. Most of the work was around myself and figuring out what unconditional love of myself looks like of myself. In doing that, allowing me to understand how to unconditionally love other people but first realizing it’s gotta start with myself. I’ve got to be a little more gentle with myself and compassionate and forgiving because I’ve had some negative voices, negative self-talk, for a long time. A lot of healing went on. There’s things—images from the nights, the journeys—that will come up in dreams or during the day I’ll think about something that happened or something that I thought about. It’s constantly trying to integrate those lessons into everyday life.”

How’d it change your life?

“Man, it’s hard to answer that question with a short answer. But a lot of different ways. The most important way was really that self-love part. I think it’s unlocked a lot of my heart. Being able to fully give my heart to my teammates, my loved ones, relationships because I can fully embrace unconditionally myself. Just didn’t do that for a long time. I was very self-critical. When you have so much judgment on yourself it’s easy to transfer that judgment to other people. When you figure out a better way to love yourself, I think you can love people better because you’re not casting the same judgment you cast on yourself on other people. I’m really thankful for that.”

I asked about his fraught and estranged relationship with his family in California, and whether that might now get fixed.

“Honestly, that was a big intention I brought into the second journey this offseason,” he said. “I really felt like I wanted to surrender and open up to the medicine for some healing to come through and some direction on how to kind of go about that. And it didn’t. It didn’t necessarily. The big message was unconditionally loving myself is the key to being able to heal all relationships—with them, past relationships with lovers, whatever it might be…So that gives me a lot of hope in healing at some point. There was nothing specific that came through in my three nights of journey, per se, but it was everything to learn how to love myself better because every relationship is changed from that standpoint. Including the way I look at them [family members] and the hope I have for reconciliation at some point.”

I told him what I’d observed in my one-practice snapshot and here in the locker room. (Which I admit is a shallow way to draw any conclusion about a person. I don’t really know Rodgers. This is my Polaroid view of the ’20 and ’21 MVP—that’s it.) He looked happy on the field, thrilled to see practice visitor Jordy Nelson, hugging Nelson’s wife, laughing with Cobb, talking and smiling in an interaction with Doubs. Placid man.

He brought up all the coaches and players who he says make the game fun for him when I asked if there was a time when he was been down on football and now he loved it more.

“I don’t think it’s that,” he said. “I think [love of the game] has just deepened. My love for football has been there since I was 5 or 6 years old. But there’s a difference between loving something and being in love with something. Right? I think we can all relate to that. Loving people or being in love with people, loving things or being in love with things. I think I just fell back in love with football the last few years. It’s due to a mindset but also the people. I really do. I give credit to the Nathaniel Hacketts of the world and Luke Getsy, Justin Outten, Matt LaFleur—and Tom Clements coming back. Randall Cobb coming back and Marcedes Lewis. Robert Tonyan and Allen Lazard and Mason Crosby, and of course David Bakhtiari. All the people who make this thing so fun. I love people. I love my teammates so much. I love the opportunity to do this.

“But I think I just fell in love with it a little bit deeper. Again, I think a lot of that is due to the work that I’ve done on myself. It hasn’t all been just the ayahuasca journey. It’s been therapy. It’s been meditation. It’s been changing habits that weren’t giving me any type of joy. Eating better. Taking care of myself a little bit better. Being more gentle with myself. All those things have allowed me to look at each day with a little more joy.”

So, the obvious question is: does this violate the NFL’s substance-abuse policy? I don’t know. Checked with the league late Friday, and got a no-comment. But it’s likely the league never thought of South American psychedelics when creating the substance abuse policy. I was told over the weekend that the league will very likely not do anything to Rodgers retroactively because he’s not tested positive for a banned substance, and as for the future, who knows?

More in Ten Things below about Rodgers’ football regrets, but I wanted to get to the big thing around the Packers this summer: Wefense.

That’s what Bisaccia calls his special teams. Not offense, not defense, but a patchwork of the entire team in the kicking game. Last year, it was more like awfulfense. Flashback to the divisional game in frigid Lambeau in January. Pack up 10-3. Six minutes left. Niners ball at the Green Bay 19, fourth and one. The defense stones a Niner rush, loss of two, and now the Packers have to run out the clock on a zero-degree wind-chill night. But they do nothing on the fortuitous possession, and they have to punt, and punt front breaks down, and the Corey Bojorquez punt is blocked and recovered for a touchdown. Niners won on a field goal at :00.

Lots of things went wrong, but special teams coordinator Maurice Drayton got fired after a year on the job, a year continuing the tradition of disastrous play on kicking teams. After some aggressive recruiting by coach LaFleur, and a reported $2-million-a-year contract, Bisaccia was a Packer.

Bisaccia’s “wefense” ethos, as he explained Sunday, is that a special teams unit takes players from everywhere on the roster, and all must play unselfishly.

“On a punt team,” he said, “your wing might be a safety, one flyer might be a wide receiver, one might be a cornerback, the personal protector might be a fullback. It takes the whole team. I tell the players, ‘The only ‘I’ I want to hear is what can I do to help us win.’”

Bisaccia has brought a sense of vigor and importance to early practices. When he thought the 11 punt-team players were lethargic coming out of the huddle on one play, he ran 60 yards to get to them and yell: “Get back in the huddle! Come outta the huddle like you mean it!”

LaFleur said Bisaccia “can love players tough better than any coach I’ve ever met. He’s ultra-demanding but earns their respect by really caring about them. It’s an art, what he’s able to do.”

Bisaccia told me this job reminds him of the first NFL job he took—in Tampa Bay in 2002 on Jon Gruden’s staff.

“That was a team, with Warren Sapp and Derrick Brooks and Ronde Barber and John Lynch and Simeon Rice, that was built to win now,” he said. “I feel like I’m in the same position here with Aaron Rodgers and this team. I feel that same sense of urgency. It fuels me.”

The special teams need a jolt. I say Rodgers solves the receiver jigsaw the way he always does. He might struggle a bit replacing the best third- down and red-zone receiver in football, Adams, but give him time. If Green Bay can finally overcome its recent history of blown January chances, Rodgers will be the most vital element. But Bisaccia’s impact must be felt too.

NFL's big decisions

Watson

In the wake of the news that independent arbitrator Sue L. Robinson ruled Cleveland quarterback Deshaun Watson should be suspended for the first six games of the 2022 season, six points:

1. The length of the ban is six games too short. Robinson spends a chunk of the report criticizing the NFL for suggesting a full-season ban with no precedent, or as she says: “The NFL is attempting to impose a more dramatic shift in its culture without the benefit of fair notice to—and consistency of consequence for—those in the NFL subject to the policy.” Come on. Should the NFL have a discipline handbook that says, 10-15 civil lawsuits alleging lewd conduct against—8 games; more than 15—a full season?

2. Robinson’s characterization of the offenses as “non-violent sexual assault” really feels wrong. Technically, I suppose you could say that the acts Watson was accused of were “non-violent,” but the accuser described a perverse act, a crime. Reading Robinson’s ruling, I felt she minimized the acts she finds Watson to have committed. That’s certainly how the most public of Watson’s accusers, Ashley Solis, saw it. “What do the actions of the NFL say to little girls who have suffered at the hands of someone perceived to have power?” she said in a statement after the ruling. “That it is not a big deal. That they don’t care. Tough s—. That’s what I’ve taken from their actions.” Except it’s not over. The system set up to rule on such discipline is obviously league-slanted, because the commissioner or his designee hears the appeal. And it would be surprising if designee Peter Harvey doesn’t add some teeth to the sanction on Watson.

3. I hear there’s not much of a chance for the two sides to settle this case before Harvey rules. But a settlement is the best idea. Increase the sanction to 10 games, let Watson back for the post-Thanksgiving stretch of seven games that includes a game against each division foe. Ten games feels light to me, but in the words of noted middle-ground-seeker Paul Tagliabue, “All’s well that ends.” Period.

4. One influential NFL person told me on this trip that it doesn’t sit well with the league or 31 other owners that the Browns rigged the Watson contract so that his suspension would cause him to lose only a fraction of his 2022 compensation. A suspension of six games, for instance, means Watson would be docked six-eighteenths (there are 18 game weeks, including the bye) of his $1.035-million salary, or $344,655. So if Robinson’s suspension with no additional fine other than six game checks stands, it means Watson would lose 0.7 percent of his $46-million total compensation this year. That’s almost absurd beyond words. I expect Harvey to be under some pressure to levy a multi-million-dollar fine of Watson in whatever he rules.

5. Let’s say Watson misses the first 10 games and comes back to play. That would mean he’d have gone 99 weeks without playing a football game, and he’d be coming back to play with a new team with receivers he’d never played a game with. At one of my camp stops, I asked an offensive coach how he thought Watson would play after such a long layoff. “Everybody’s assuming he’ll come back and be Deshaun Watson. I wonder. He’ll be working out, and he’ll probably find some receivers to throw to while he’s out, but being out that long and coming back with a new team—there’s no guarantee he’ll be that good this year.”

6. Blows my mind Watson has shown no public remorse in this case.

Dolphins

In the wake of the news that the Dolphins were docked first- and third-round picks, and owner Stephen Ross was suspended till mid-October and fined $1.5-miilion for tampering with Tom Brady while the quarterback was under contract to both New England and Tampa Bay, six points:

1. Ross denied virtually everything and seemed outraged at his organization being found guilty of tampering. But he’s lucky the league’s investigation gave him a pass on what could have made the NFL force him to sell the team—charges by Brian Flores that the owner offered him $100,000 per game to lose in order to better their draft position. The league couldn’t conclusively corroborate Flores’ tanking story, which saved Ross.

2. The league has a “legal tampering” period prior to the start of free-agency each year, during which time teams and agents can come to agreements on new contract. But enforcement of regular tampering has been lax, to say the least. There’s a no-harm-no-foul ethos—at least that’s my sense—when it comes to pre-free-agency contact with player agents and players, and I think that’s part of this case. This is Roger Goodell drawing a line and saying, Tampering stops now. You’re all warned.

3. This makes Tom Brady look bad, obviously, like it’s okay for him to play by a different set of rules because he’s Tom Brady. Maybe he knew this was coming, and that’s why he’s had one press availability in training camp, and none since this news came down Tuesday. Whenever he does speak, this is going to be very hard to justify in any way.

4. Great point by a good source: “Usually when you’re investigated for tampering, you’ve succeeded at getting something valuable. Miami got nothing, and it cost them a one and a three. I can’t imagine a worse outcome.”

5. This is the upshot that really hurts Miami: Before this happened, they had their own 2023 first-round pick and also San Francisco’s. Let’s just say Tua Tagovailoa is mediocre this year and Miami decides it wants to try to get in position to move up to get a quarterback in the ’23 draft. Theoretically, if their two picks were in the 15 to 22 range (just spitballing), maybe they could package those two plus their one in 2024 to move up to three or four to get a quarterback. That’s out the window now.

6. This ratchets up the pressure on Tagovailoa. Now there’s really no Plan B for 2023, unless the Miami braintrust falls in love next spring with a Kenny Pickett type talent and he falls in round one. Maybe you’d say it’s great for Tagovailoa—he can play free and easy knowing it’s going to be his job going forward. And maybe that’s the case. But I say there’s just as good a chance he feels the heat of, Dude, you simply cannot fail. He’s certainly set up to win with Tyreek Hill and Mike McDaniel on board now, and he needs to win now.

Titans Camp 20

NASHVILLE—In GM Jon Robinson’s office the other day, we were talking about how the Titans are regularly disregarded when discussing Super Bowl contenders…yet the team is on a three-year playoff streak and was the AFC’s one seed last year. Robinson smiled and said, “I’m gonna play you a song real quick,” he said, and started fiddling with his iPhone.

“Eric Church. ‘The Outsiders.’ That’s who we are,” Robinson said. Now came Church, the country star.

They’re the in crowd, we’re the other ones

It’s a different kind of cloth that we’re cut from

And so on. This is an interesting team with a braintrust that can patch holes as well as any team in football. Robinson and Mike Vrabel built a rock-ribbed defense and strong run game, with a pretty good pass game too (until divisional weekend), and they survived a ridiculous spate of injuries to lock in the AFC’s top seed. Tennessee used a league-record 91 players last year, won 12 games, and became the first team in NFL history to have eight wins over teams with winning records…despite missing Derrick Henry for half the year with a foot injury.

Vrabel gave a Belichickian response when I asked him about the Titans’ image. “I try not to focus on things that don’t matter,” he said. “We just try to build a foundation to help us withstand the ups and downs of an NFL season.”

The last time we saw the Titans was a down of epic proportions—the 19-16 home loss to Cincinnati to end the season. Ryan Tannehill threw three interceptions, one on the Titans’ first offensive play and another, the dagger, on the Titans’ final offensive play of the game. That pick, with 20 seconds left in the fourth quarter of a 16-all game, led to the winning 52-yard Cincinnati field goal at :00. And it led to huge questions about the future of Tannehill in Tennessee. His resume is overall good, but he’s lost three straight playoff games, averaging 17.3 points in the three. It would have cost the Titans a $57.4-million dead-cap charge in 2022 to move on from him, and so that was never an option.

But there’s another part of this story, a mental-health part.

“The game was heartbreaking,” Tannehill told me. “Put me in a dark spot.”

A really dark spot. He’s out of it now, mostly, but for the first time in all his years playing football, the game knocked him for such a mental loop he had to seek professional help.

“I hadn’t really been in that spot before,” he said after a broiler of a practice. “It was weeks and weeks of not really sleeping, and then kind of slowly got better from there, working my way through it. It wasn’t something that I just passively got through. I was intentionally seeking out help, talking to somebody and trying to work through the mental side of it.

“The mental side is such a big thing for everybody in life, but especially in sports. We talk about it as an organization. We have guys that help us with our bodies, help us train. We also have people that help with our minds. Being able to take advantage of that and kind of destigmatize the mental side of things. We’re all gonna go through something at different points in our life. It’s okay, right? Now you have the opportunity to work through it and be intentional about growing through the process and moving forward.

“You’re not pushing away the feelings. You’re acknowledging the feelings. You’re really feeling them and digging through why you’re feeling them, and then moving past it at that point. You’re not stuffing it away and hoping just to never feel it again. You’re acknowledging it, knowing it’s there, and then moving through it.

“Now, it’s a scar. That’s kind of how I’ve described it is that it’s a scar. It’s always there. You remember it. But it’s not a wound anymore. It doesn’t hurt the same. You acknowledge like yeah that sucked. But this is a new year. We have everything out in front of us. What happened last year, whether it was good or bad, it doesn’t matter at this point. You have to take each day as its own and take advantage of it.”

Teammates, staffers, coaches all talk of Tannehill being the same positive guy he’s always been. Now they’ve got to hope he truly is past it and can be the guy who’s gone 30-13 in three Titans seasons. His future in Tennessee probably depends on it.

As for the team, and the mental side of the game, the most important guy in Tannehill’s football life is squarely behind him—and his openness about the mental side of the game.

“We spend a lot of time in this game on our bodies,” Mike Vrabel said. “We need to spend as much time on our minds.”

Bears Camp

I want you to look at this photo of me and Bears wideout Darnell Mooney Friday after practice. I was explaining something about the importance of a quarterback and receiver being in perfect alignment. I said to him: “In that incredible New England comeback from 28-3 in the Super Bowl against Atlanta, guess which wide receiver had the most targets in the fourth quarter and overtime for the Patriots. Malcolm Mitchell.” That’s when his face got that way. Like, who is Malcolm Mitchell? Rookie. Played only one year in the NFL. Bad knee forced him to quit. I said, “When I asked Tom Brady about it, he said there was a reason for it: 112 practices.” All those comeback routes Mitchell ran late in the game and Brady targeted him on were because they’d run them a couple of hundred times in practice, and Brady trusted him implicitly.

My point: I’d just watched Justin Fields practice in the new Luke Getsy offense imported from Green Bay, and I felt very much that it’s a work in progress. Fields rolled right several times, a la Aaron Rodgers, and looked for a receiver, and he ended up tucking it and running. It’s only with time that someone—Mooney, rookie Velus Jones, Dante Pettis, tight end Cole Kmet — or maybe more than one will get in tune with Fields, and the young QB will be able to find a receiver instead of running. Nothing wrong with running, of course — Fields is fleet and quick. But it’s good to know if he rolls right six times a game, he has a legit run or pass option five or six times.

“I’m happy you shared that story with me,” Mooney said. “I’m not sure how long it will take. But that makes perfect sense.”

This is what a new offense is like, and this is what a new regime is like. Rookie GM Ryan Poles says he doesn’t like calling this a teardown, but what do you call a camp roster with 54 of 91 players brand new…and the personnel staff new, and the coaching staff new, and the franchise quarterback in his 16th month on campus?

This is going to take a while, but Poles isn’t taking shortcuts, and that’s good. When Poles traded 31-year-old Khalil Mack to the Chargers for second- and sixth-round picks, it was a signal that Poles and coach Matt Eberflus want to build for the long haul. That’s why I don’t think this is a make-or-break year for Fields. He’ll have every chance to win the job long term, and patience will be a virtue with this staff. Getsy is a teacher of the first order. “Probably the best quarterback coach I’ve had in my life,” said Fields.

When I watched Fields Friday, what I thought needed the most work was his anticipation throws, his rhythm throws. Not to harp on Brady, but what became rote with him was knowing precisely where each receiver would be on each route, so he could throw when the receiver wasn’t looking, certain of the spot he’d be when the ball was released. Fields isn’t there yet.

“We’re working on the rhythm throws,” Eberflus said.

Fields gets it. He knows mastering an offense means being able to throw ball after ball to a spot, not waiting to see him be open. The key will be for Fields and for the fans to understand this will take time, and lots of the final pieces aren’t on this roster yet.

“Each day I feel we take a step forward,” said Fields. That’s important.

I’m not bullish on the Bears to contend this year. On the total rebuilds — Bears, Giants, Texans, Jags — that’s really okay. In fact, it’s preferable. I am bullish on the groundwork being laid by Poles and Eberflus. The respect they have for Bears history, and the desire to get the Bears back to contention, was evident Friday. Eberflus, when setting up his office, wanted to honor the history of the franchise and make every player aware that their jobs are to return the franchise to prominence. In the space behind his desk that most coaches reserve for family photos or mementos, the new coach asked for pictures of the nine Bears with retired numbers. When players sit in his office, he asks them to name at least three of them. Some get Walter Payton. Some get Dick Butkus. But it’s ancient history to most. But they matter, and Eberflus wants to keep them alive for this generation.

Also behind his desk, in the middle of display of the great Bears, are two empty plexiglass shelves, small ones, and two empty spots at the base of the display. Eberflus wanted the two shelves for George Halas Trophies, emblematic of the NFC champions. And he wanted the spaces below to be there for two Super Bowl trophies.

That’s right: Super Bowl trophies. They don’t call them Lombardi Trophies around here, by the way.

Vin Scully: 1927-2022 30

The greatest baseball announcer in history (there, I said it) was pretty good at football too. At the time of his death at 94, it’s fitting to recall his greatest moment in a football booth. He called The Catch, the winning TD grab by Dwight Clark in the 1981 San Francisco-Dallas NFC Championship Game and left football broadcasting immediately thereafter. It was his call to make that his last football call.

Six years ago, Scully was asked if he regretted not grabbing onto the NFL and becoming a huge name announcing football.

I loved his answer. He stayed with his passion.

“Oh, no, not at all,” Scully said. “The reason I did the NFL was, first of all, I was offered the opportunity and I gave it a thought. And I kept thinking, you know, I’ve been doing baseball so long that I could fall into a trap of just doing it by rote and I thought I could use a challenge. So I was offered the opportunity to do football and golf. And I thought, I need to work harder in another sport.

“So I used the NFL as much as I possibly could just trying to wake me up. And I was privileged to work with some wonderful experts. Then I wound up with Hank Stram doing a game that will be memorable, I guess, the one called ‘The Catch,’ with Joe Montana and Dwight Clark. When that game ended, I got on the airplane and I was emotionally worn out from doing it and making sure I didn’t make some horrific mistake. But when I got on the airplane I thought, ‘Okay, I’ve done it. I’ve gotten the boost that I needed for my energy.’ That was it. When the plane landed and I got home, I told my family, ‘That’s a great game on which to call it a football career.’ That was it. It served a marvelous purpose to just to reawaken me, I guess.”

Scully, I always thought, did four things perfectly: He relaxed listeners with a lovely lilting voice, never feeling forced or awkward—just neighborly. He was perfectly informed about everything he discussed. He told incredible stories, and told them like he was sitting next to you, talking to you and only you. He could put a gigantic baseball game or part of it into historical context immediately, such as the historical and social implications of Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth’s home run record playing in the city of Atlanta.

Listen. You can hear him say it. Unrushed. Measured. Important.

“What a marvelous moment for baseball; what a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia; what a marvelous moment for the country and the world. A black man is getting a standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol. And it is a great moment for all of us, and particularly for Henry Aaron.”

Worker bee too. Elliott Kalb, his statistician, tells a story about Scully doing an NBC Game of the Week game at Wrigley Field on a Saturday afternoon. He was due back in LA for a Sunday afternoon game and so had a flight Saturday evening to Los Angeles. On the way to the airport, the car broke down. Scully got out. He hitch-hiked to the airport. He wasn’t going to miss the Sunday game.

Bob Costas offered this:

“The combination of his unique talent, his command of the craft, his pleasing and distinctive voice, his lyrical style, his command of language, his enormous frame of reference. Combine all of that, and then spread it over his 67-year career. A huge amount of baseball history. His first year, 1950, was Connie Mack’s last year managing the Philadelphia A’s. Mack was born in 1862, during the Civil War.

“And…when you take that part into account and the fact that he starts with the Brooklyn Dodgers, not just any team, but Jackie Robinson’s Boys of Summer Dodgers. If he was the voice of any other team, relatively nondescript team, he’d still be a Hall of Fame broadcaster. But he was the voice of the Dodgers. Think of all that history. All those compelling characters. The circumstances of his career elevate his talent, which was already top-of-the-mountain talent.”

Tampa Bay linebacker Devin White, entering his fourth season, on his love of horses. He owns 30 of them.

“As a kid, being from Cotton Valley, La., that’s all we did. Horse country. I always rather have a horse than a dog because you gotta feed the dog, walk the dog. The horse does all the work for you. You just sit on his back. So that made life easy, you know?

“I got a dog now, a Blue Heeler. Look it up. Cattle dog. One of the best dogs I ever had in my life. She follows my horse. I don’t gotta walk her. She follows us when we go on rides.”

Why a horse over a dog?

“The horse does the work. When I go out to enjoy my horse, I’m on his back. Or her back. She’s doing all the moving. I’m just sitting up there. If you’re on a dog walk, you gotta work and the dog’s gotta work. It just makes more sense. I can go hunt on my horse. I can go through trails on my horse. I can do whatever. I can ride my horse to the store. I can’t ride a dog to the store.

“Yup, I ride my horse to the store [in Louisiana]. Tie it up outside, like the old days. Walk in the store, get whatever I need, come out. You stop at the store, tie him up and go in there. I would say a lot of people do that.”

King of the Road

Road-related snippets from the past eight days:

CINCINNATI—Orioles-Reds, Great American Ballpark, Sunday afternoon, lovely day, bottom of the first. Joey Votto coming to the dish. His walkup music: “Jolene,” by Dolly Parton. Just to be sure I wasn’t hearing things, I made sure to listen before his second at-bat—there cannot be a major-league player with Dolly Parton as the walkup singer. Sure enough, this wafted over the speakers when Votto came up a second time:

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

I’m begging you please don’t take my man…

NASHVILLE—The Last Supper with Dom Bonvissuto and fam came at Lockeland Table in East Nashville, a day after he edited Football Morning in America for the last time. Lockeland Table’s one of my favorite spots on the tour. So Dom has left the nest. He edited this column for almost 13 years and is moving to a new gig at Outkick. I have only one negative to report about the meal: Dom had the Southern Hawaiian pizza, with peaches on it. Dom! Come on! Peaches on pizza! So good to see my little buddy, Jude, going into sixth grade this week, and Dom’s wife, Danny, just a terrific person. Goodbye’s not forever, Dom.

NASHVILLE TO TAMPA—Evening flight, Southwest. I have had very good post-Covid fortune about all things air travel, but that ended here. When I boarded, I grabbed the bulkhead window, with the aisle seat occupied and the middle seat empty. A few minutes later, a large man, tall and quite wide, sat in the middle. Unfortunately, I was pressed to my left pretty far. There was no room to move. Two hours of this. Hmmm. I excused myself and moved down to 26B. Center seat, a bit of room. In a past life, I’d be fuming. After 42 years of marriage, I think Ann King’s approach to life—why get bothered by things you can’t control?—is rubbing off. In a year of travel nightmares, I haven’t had a single one. So two hours of an inconvenience…that’s the travel life sometimes.

TAMPA—I want to tell you about rain. End-of-the-earth rain, buckets and buckets of it, .95 inches in an hour, as we left the Bucs training facility a bit after 1 p.m. A bolt of lightning, from sky to earth, with crackling thunder, preceded the incredible storm. The Bucs handed me an umbrella to walk the eight steps to the car my crew pulled up to the front door of the place, and even with umbrella, when I get into the car, I was as wet as if I’d just walked out of the swimming pool. Writing this on a plane to Minneapolis, a few hours later. My socks are soaked through. My sneakers, same. Man, the rain on the gulf coast of Florida is serious.

GREEN BAY—Have I sung the praises of Lodge Kohler enough? It’s my favorite hotel on the circuit by far, with location (across the street from Lambeau Field, in the cool Titletown District), old Packers photos in every room, modern rooms with crazy-good Kohler showers, bottle of Charles Woodson’s “Intercept” pinot noir in the room as a welcome gift. Midwest-friendly. The best. One quibble, and this is Everywhere USA in airports and restaurants and public spaces and it’s really quite mad: Lobby/restaurant music stuck in the eighties. (Seventies, maybe.) Sereneded at breakfast Thursday with Solsbury Hill by Peter Gabriel, Hot Legs by Rod Stewart, Burnin’ for You by Blue Oyster Cult, Long Train Running by the Doobie Brothers, The Joker by the Steve Miller Band. Can’t we progress in music a bit, people?

I owe a bit of an assist on the Green Bay trip to the Packers’ media-relations czar, Jason Wahlers. Ten minutes after leaving my confab with Aaron Rodgers at Lambeau Thursday afternoon, my lower left crown on a molar popped out chewing a protein bar. I asked Wahlers if he knew a dentist who might be able to see me. He found one. His dentist, Matthew Nelson of Parc Village Dental, could see me, and it took him 25 minutes from start of procedure to end to adhesive that baby back in. He was curious about whether I’d talked to Rodgers about the psychedelic mushrooms. I said yes, and he said he’d have to read the column Monday. Thanks for the save, Dr. Nelson.

ON I-94 WEST TO MINNEAPOLIS—Jason Garrett, the new NBC Football Night in America analyst, joined us at Bears camp, fresh off his first NFL show Thursday night in Canton. Two hours sleep. But he was going to see the Bears, Vikings and Packers in three days as part of his homework for the new gig, and he was all smiles when we met him in Lake Forest, home of the Bears. First thing first. The drive. Four hundred miles. “Six hours!” he said. I explained that three decades of training-camp travel in the summer, with storms and flight delays and airport crowds, had sent me to cars almost exclusively. Seven hours or less, with my NBC-appointed helpers doing 70 percent of the driving (I do some; I love driving), and we always drove. In this big Ford Explorer, I could nap or type in the back, fairly efficiently. So Jason was in. We got lunch at Culver’s in Wisconsin—he’d never had the custardy Wisco delight—and he napped for maybe 90 minutes around Wisconsin Dells. Then he woke up. “Want to play a game?” he said. “Twenty questions?” We had three rounds of the people-places-things car-ride time-killer. He went first. On the 16th question, I asked, “Is it George Halas?” Yes. My turn. I picked a Kit Kat Bar. On the 20th question—clutch play here—Kelsey Bartels said, “Is it a Kit Kat Bar?” So it was done, and we were at a late dinner at my favorite Twin Cities spot, Pizzeria Lola, and Garrett was into his pizza, telling stories, totally content. “One of the all-time great days,” Garrett said. Another camp convert!

Six games is an outrage. From Chris, of Cleveland: “Most of my friends agree with me—six games for [Deshaun] Watson is terrible. Way too light. You won’t believe how many people who love the Browns are pissed at this so-called penalty.”

I don’t think it’ll stay at six games, Chris. But as I wrote higher in this column, I think most of the women who were involved in the Watson accusations would strongly disagree with the arbitrator, Sue L. Robinson, minimizing the seriousness of the offenses by calling it “nonviolent sexual conduct.” I would agree with you and those who criticize Robinson’s ruling.

Don’t slight Tomlin’s intelligence. From Chris Wilkinson of McGeheysville, Va.: “I’m a faithful reader of the column. One thing I notice is that you frequently refer to white coaches as brilliant and intelligent. With that in mind, I was disappointed that your profile of Mike Tomlin focused on his leadership and communication. These are important. However, you mentioned little to nothing about his play-calling, schemes, or other qualities establishing his clear intelligence and smarts. It’s important to recognize that these omissions signal implicit bias and feed into racial norms Black people face every day.”

That’s a good point, Chris. Thanks for bringing it to my attention. But I was not writing a profile of Mike Tomlin. I was not writing much about the architecture of the offense or defense, or really anything other than what a good job he does as a leader of men in a time of major transition. I agree that a longer profile of him would call for some of what you say, examination and praise of what he’s done in X’s and O’s and motivation. Your larger point, though, is fair.

Why not Miami? From Tony Reed: I would like to ask why you aren’t going to the Dolphins training camp (it’s my team). It just seems like lots of good storylines this year and as an avid reader I would like to hear your thoughts on what you see in person.”

Hi, Tony. Originally the Dolphins were on my itinerary, but the only day I could fit them into my rubric the way it turned out was a day the players were off. Certainly would have been a good spot to visit with the news of this week.

Why not the Jets? From Jeff Brosnan (on Twitter): “Don’t understand your reasoning for going to Giants training camp and ignoring the Jets who have a better team and far more potential. You’ll mea culpa this down the road.”

Can’t hit ‘em all, Jeff. Picked the Giants because I hadn’t been to their camp in a few years (seven or eight, I think) and because of the fact that they’d done something they hadn’t done since 1979—hire a GM and coach both from outside the organization. I always try to hit teams with good stories and teams that might go far.

RIP Vin. From Charles Freeman of Los Angeles: “Many years and several careers ago, I was a meter reader here in Los Angeles. One of the houses I read in Pacific Palisades was that of Mr. Scully and his family. I‘d sometimes see him at the house and running errands in the Palisades Village. Then, in the early 1980s, I became friendly with Dodgers player Derrell Thomas and got to meet Mr. Scully at the stadium. He was gracious and kind every time I encountered him. We all know his voice and the greatness of his long and legendary career. He’s probably one of the last to ever see both Babe Ruth and Henry Aaron play. He was close to Jackie Robinson and called Fernando Valenzuela’s games decades later. He told us about Koufax’s 4 no-hitters, called Dodgers World Series triumphs and one sad Sunday afternoon in July 1993, he gave us the sad news that Don Drysdale had passed in his Montreal hotel room. Heaven’s radio station has a new announcer tonight.”

Wonderfully put, Charles. Thank you.

10 Things I Think I Think 40

1. I think when owners meet in Minneapolis Tuesday to approve the $4.65-billion bid to buy the Broncos by Rob Walton, it’ll be the formality of formalities. “This meeting could be a five-minute Zoom,” one club exec told me over the weekend. You don’t say no to pockets that deep.

2. I think, with opening night a month from today, the scariest injury news for any team in the league is the elbow soreness that Matthew Stafford has. The Rams have downplayed it. Stafford, after throwing on Saturday, downplayed it. But the Super Bowl champs won’t have a chance to repeat if Stafford misses serious time with an injury. “I felt like I could make any throw I wanted to, but I’m just trying to be smart,” Stafford said Saturday. We don’t know and Stafford probably doesn’t know for sure if it’s going to be an issue, but it bears watching. Closely.

3. I think this is in the category of “contract squabbles I do not understand.” Kareem Hunt, Cleveland running back, is partially holding-in—the new term for being in camp but not practicing because he wants a new contract. Hunt was practicing in some drills and not others during the week, and he was reportedly back in all drills Sunday. He is in the last year of his contract. Due to make $6.25-million this year if he’s active all season (the deal includes per-game roster bonuses). Hunt has been a Brown for three years. He’s averaged 469 rushing yards per season as the team 1b to 1a Nick Chubb. I understand his point; he thinks he should be paid like a starting running back because he is as good as one. Hunt won a rushing title while in Kansas City. But football doesn’t work that way, particularly at running back. Backups, even excellent ones, don’t get paid like starters particularly in an era of declining running-back value.

4. I think I like the fact that some teams—the Vikings and USFL in the spring, Seattle upcoming—are bringing in Jay Glazer to talk to players about mental health. Glazer wrote a book (“Unbreakable: How I turned my depression and anxiety into motivation and you can too”) on his struggles, and teams noticed. It’s so good to see him use his platform and his struggles growing up to reach others who might be feeling the same pain and feel they can’t talk about it. Ran into him Saturday at the Vikings. Glazer’s message to players, in part: “You guys don’t just do tackling drills when you miss tackles. You always practice that. That’s proactive. Mental health is too reactive—you usually address it when the sky is falling. That’s got to change. Be proactive. You have an amazing support system sitting to your right and left. Teammates. Having a team can get us through the gray of depression and anxiety. Lean on each other. Talk to each other. Everyone I’ve opened up to about my mental health struggles, it’s only made us closer. Be there for each other. Vulnerability is true strength.”

5. I think there’s really only one thing that pockmarks Aaron Rodgers’ football legacy: the fact that he’s 7-9, with zero Super Bowl wins and zero NFC titles, in the last 11 postseasons, since quarterbacking the Packers to the Lombardi Trophy in the 2010 season. He bared his soul a bit when I asked him if it hurts to look back on how the last two seasons ended—home playoff losses to Tampa and San Francisco when the Packers had NFC home-field. “I’m hurt by all the playoff losses,” he said, then he reeled them off: “2009, [51-45 to Arizona] the way I started and finished that game. The 49er game in ’13 hurts [23-20 loss]. The loss to the Giants in ’11, we had a chance. We were so good that season. 2014 is the one that always sticks with you [28-22 overtime loss to Seattle]. When you think about the worst losses in your career, I mean both of them were in Seattle—the Fail Mary game in 2012, NFC Championship in the ’14 season. But they all stick with you, because you think about what you could’ve done better. Plays you should’ve made.”

Specifically, I asked about the third-and-11 throw with three minutes left in a 10-10 game against the Niners last January, when, from his own 28, he chose to target Adams in tight double coverage deep downfield instead of Lazard running free for the easiest throw of the night. Lazard was free at the Green Bay 46-yard line, and could have made another 10 or 15 yards, easy, after the catch.

“Of course,” Rodgers said. “You think about all those plays from all the years. Never goes away. Doesn’t mean that you dwell on them or you can’t get past them. You’re a competitor, you remember maybe the failures more than the successes. I think that’s just a part of loving to compete and hating to lose maybe more than you love to win. Doesn’t mean we’re gonna get stuck on it. The finality of this league is so difficult because of how fast it comes on. You lose a game, the next day’s a meeting and that’s the last time that group will ever be together. People are always like, ‘Super Bowl hangover’ or ‘playoff loss hangover,’ but I’ve never believed that because it’s a different team every single year. We have so many different guys now. Guys that we brought in from other teams. We drafted a bunch of guys. A bunch of guys are gone. It’s a new team. We gotta figure out how to win with this team and hopefully get over the hump this year.

6. I think I loved what Dick Vermeil said in his Hall of Fame speech Saturday. “If Mike Jones doesn’t make that tackle at the end of Super Bowl 34, I’m not standing here. I will forever be indebted to all of you people,” Vermeil said. That is so true. Players making plays lead to coaches being in the Hall, and Vermeil recognized it on the biggest day of his career.

7. I think Rick Gosselin is one of the people I admire most in my business—honest to a fault, full of love for football history, so authoritative on all things football. He and the late Paul Zimmerman are the two Hall of Fame voters I respect the most over my 30 years on the selection committee. He has launched rickgosselin.com, and I’ll be bookmarking it. His all-time annual special-teams rankings are one staple of the site, along with think pieces we’re better for having read. Such this one on the rush to enshrine quantity of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

8. I think I often call Gosselin the conscience of the Hall voting panel, and this story encapsulates why. He wonders about numbers playing an outsized role in Hall enshrinement. Five receivers with at least 1,000 catches—Reggie Wayne, Andre Johnson, Steve Smith, Anquan Boldin and Hines Ward, “seemingly waiting their turn for gold jackets.” Gosselin raises the cases of three all-decade receivers from the sixties: Gary Collins, Boyd Dowler, Del Shofner. He makes a point I hope I live by on the committee: Judge players in large part against those in the era in which they played. Writes Gosselin:

“Quantity” of catch is king for receivers now. But “quality” of catch was king for receivers in the 1960s — what did you do with the football after you caught it?

Dowler caught 474 career passes, Shofner 349, Collins 330 and none amassed more than 7,300 career yards with those receptions. So there is no comparison quantity-wise with Boldin, Johnson, Smith, Ward and Wayne. But there also is no comparison in the quality of catch — and those numbers all slant in favor of the pass catchers from the 1960s.

Shofner averaged 18.5 yards per catch, Collins 16.0 yards and Dowler 15.3. Smith averaged 14.3 yards per catch, Johnson and Wayne 13.4, Boldin 12.8 and Ward 12.1. Collins caught 70 career touchdown passes. So did Johnson. But it took Collins 66 fewer games for his 70 than it took Johnson. Collins scored a touchdown every 4.7 catches, Johnson every 15.1 catches. Shofner scored a TD every 6.8 catches, Boldin every 13.1 catches.

Do Boldin, Johnson, Smith, Ward and Wayne deserve discussion for the Hall of Fame? Without question, yes. But so did Collins, Dowler and Shofner…and they never got it. Players should neither be rewarded nor punished for playing in the eras that they did.

9. I think I feel pretty confident about this preseason opinion: Kyle Trask will play the most snaps of any quarterback on the Bucs. Tampa wants to see what it has in the second-year second-rounder, and there’s no time like meaningless August games to do so.

10. I think these are my other thoughts of the week:

a. Column of the Week: Dylan Hernandez of the Los Angeles Times with an emotional beauty on his relationship with Vin Scully. This brought tears to my eyes.

b. Wrote Hernandez, who covered the Dodgers in the late stages of Scully’s play-by-play career:

The first time I spoke to him was in 2007 shortly after The Times hired me to cover the Dodgers. I ran into him in the bathroom of the press box bearing his name. While I thought it would be weird to introduce myself to him there, it occurred to me that it might be weirder to not.

When I told him who I was, he said he had heard of me and started doing that Vin Scully thing where he narrated the details of a person’s life.

“You were born in Los Angeles,” he said. “Your father is from El Salvador; your mother is from Japan. I speak a few words of Japanese myself: Konnichiwa. …”

He went on and on like this. The voice I used to hear on my transistor radio was talking to me, about me. I would have been intimidated if not for his warmth. He insisted that I called him “Vin” instead of “Mr. Scully.”

c. You need to read the Vin/Mr. Scully duel between the kid and the legend. I shan’t spoil it here. It’s beautiful.

d. How great is it to understand that a person at the absolute top of his profession is also a very, very good person? Rest in peace, Vin Scully.

e. I find it wholly sad and really amazing that the Royals dumped former favorite son and friend-of-Mahomes Whit Merrifield to Toronto at the trading deadline. (Great trade, Toronto.) Sam McDowell of the Kansas City Star encapsulated it well.

f. First, the irony of going to Toronto. Merrifield was one of 10 Royals who had to skip a road series at Toronto in July because they were unvaccinated, and he said of getting the vax, “That might change down the road” if he got traded to a team in Canada or a team that could play in Toronto in the postseason. In other words: The games I play for the Royals in Canada aren’t important enough because our team is a loser. It did not go over well. The fans’ favorite player got booed in his next game in KC. Not to over-baseball you, but that was a stunner to me.

g. The trading deadline was fun…except for the part of Christian Vazquez, longest-tenured Sox guy, going to the ‘Stros. I’ll miss the dedication and effort and overall ethos of Vazquez.

h. Beer Can of the Week: Thunder Ann American Pale Ale, from Jackalope Brewing Company, Nashville, Tenn. Look at this crazy can, with a woman in a forest with serpents (trust me).

i. Beernerdness: Doom Pedal White Ale (Fifty West Brewing, Cincinnati) was the best beer on the trip so far. The Cincinnati beer scene is outrageous, with choices out the wazoo. Drank it out of the can. The faint taste of coriander, a staple of these ales, was there, with a smooth finish and bolder than customary (for a Witbier) hoppiness. Loved it.

j. Of course, it wasn’t a trip to Green Bay without the Spotted Cow.

k. Coffeenerdness: Coffee shops are king in Minneapolis. So many good ones. Thanks to FRGMNT (not a big believer in vowels or lower-case, I guess) for being a tremendous work space Saturday and Sunday mornings…and for the terrific lattes.

l. Football Feature Story of the Week: Tyler R. Tynes of GQ (Way to go, Tyler!) with a gem on Ja’Marr Chase.

m. Chase controls what he can control. As Tynes writes, he’s big on perspective and has stressed it with his excitable Dad. Wrote Tynes:

That perspective was always there, even as a kid. Whenever Ja’Marr’s high school, Archbishop Rummel, would drop a game, his father would be “bent out of shape.” But as a teenager, Ja’Marr was a source of calm. He’d tell Jimmy, “It’s just a game, Dad.”

So, even though the Super Bowl represented the first time he’d ever lost a championship game, Ja’Marr processed the defeat quickly. He says he was over it in a few hours. “I was pissed that we lost,” Ja’Marr says. “But man, I gotta be happy I made it this far. I just made it to the Super Bowl. What can I complain about?”

n. So the interesting thing that I found in Cincinnati, by the way, is the non-devastated feeling of the team after the bummer of a Super Bowl loss. Chase illustrated why. Holy crap! We made the Super Bowl! I understand it’s not cool to just get there, but be real. Either team could have won the divisional game at Tennessee, and either team could have won the title game in Kansas City. So another one of those games in the Super Bowl and the Bengals lost? Meh.

o. I just realized I had a football thought in my non-football thoughts. Is that acceptable?

p. Happy 97th(last Wednesday), Marv Levy.

q. Now, get ready for this stunner of a birthday. I had to look at his birth year a few times and say, “Really?”

r. Happy 73rd, Brian Sipe.

s. Seventy-three!!! Did you know…In 1980, only one player (Dan Fouts) threw for more yards than Sipe’s 4,132, and only one player (Steve Bartkowski) threw for more touchdowns than Sipe’s 30.

t. I could not be happier for a verdict than for the $4.1-million Alex Jones has to pay for lying, lying, lying, lying about what happened in Sandy Hook, causing the parents of the dead to undergo even more mental torture because of the threats from sheeple following Jones.

u. Radio Story of the Week: Terry Gross, of NPR’s Fresh Air, on the documentary “Afghanistan Undercover,” secretly filed by filmmaker Ramita Navai on the perils for women in Afghanistan.

v. Per Terry Gross:

The documentary was filmed outside the capital Kabul, in Afghanistan’s provinces, where the crackdown on women’s rights has been particularly harsh. Since coming into power, the Taliban have broken their promise to allow girls to continue their schooling beyond sixth grade. With a few exceptions, women are no longer allowed to work. When out in the street, they are expected to be covered from head to toe with only an opening for their eyes. Many girls and women are disappearing — arrested for violating the morality code or abducted and forced to marry one of the Taliban.”

[Said Navai:] “What’s happening is that the Taliban are abducting women and girls and taking them without the family’s consent, without a bride price. And what usually happens, the pattern that usually follows, is that a Taliban fighter or even a Taliban commander — because we uncovered evidence that this was happening at high levels within the Taliban — will see or hear of a woman they want to marry. A lot of times it’s because there’s a really pretty, attractive young woman or girl that they’ve heard about or they’ve seen at the market, and they approach the family and they try the official route first — ask for a hand in marriage. When the family says no, that’s when they abduct the girl … Every single case that I came across, family members were beaten when the girls were taken.”

w. We’ve got a stake, justifiably, in helping Ukraine defend itself. But I wish we’d pay more attention to Afghanistan.

x. Welcome to Team NBC, Matthew Berry. Nice to have the greatest fantasy football authority ever onboard.

2,nbc,sport,"Alex Palou, Chip Ganassi have first conversation in weeks","['alex', 'win', 'think', 'yeah', 'chip', 'weeks', 'conversation', 'ganassi', 'palou', 'races', 'race', 'championship', 'team', 'points']","NASHVILLE, Tennessee – Alex Palou and Chip Ganassi had their first in-person conversation Sunday in roughly a month, and the banter was surprisingly upbeat and cordial.
Palou said it was the first in-person conversation they’d had since he announced July 12 that he was leaving the team for McLaren Racing next year.
“It’s not like (Ganassi) would be happy if I finished top five, to be honest,” Palou said.
“Yeah, top three, I think, he was — even if Scott didn’t win the race, he would come and congratulate.
I think there’s a lot going on, but at the end of the day, Chip would be super happy if we win the championship.","NASHVILLE, Tennessee – Alex Palou and Chip Ganassi had their first in-person conversation Sunday in roughly a month, and the banter was surprisingly upbeat and cordial.

After a third in the Music City Grand Prix – his best finish in five races since his bitter contract dispute began — Palou received a hearty congratulations (at the 3:15 mark of this video) from Ganassi, whose team sued the defending NTT IndyCar Series champion two weeks ago.

Palou said it was the first in-person conversation they’d had since he announced July 12 that he was leaving the team for McLaren Racing next year.

“We didn’t really have a chat one to one since them,” Palou said. “But, yeah, we see each other in the (team’s) trailers and stuff, and it’s not like we avoid each other.”

Was he surprised by the sudden thaw from Ganassi after getting a mostly cold shoulder for weeks?

“No, not at all,” Palou said. “No. I mean, no.”

The difference, he said, was that Ganassi celebrates podiums – and the team had two Sunday with Palou and Scott Dixon, who delivered the second consecutive victory in the Nashville street race to CGR.

“It’s not like (Ganassi) would be happy if I finished top five, to be honest,” Palou said. “Yeah, top three, I think, he was — even if Scott didn’t win the race, he would come and congratulate. Yeah, he is happy.”

Ganassi should be pleased that he has three bonafide shots at winning the 2022 IndyCar championship with three races remaining this season.

Dixon is six points behind leader Will Power, and Marcus Ericsson is 12 points behind in third.

Palou is ranked 33 points behind Josef Newgarden in fifth, and the Spaniard believes he will be given a fair shake at winning a second consecutive championship despite the inherent awkwardness of the lawsuit and the uncertainty of 2023.

“Yes, 100 percent,” Palou said. “Yeah. I think there’s a lot going on, but at the end of the day, Chip would be super happy if we win the championship. He wants one of his cars to win the championship. We cannot all three win, but he wants one car to win. I don’t think I’m getting less stuff or not so much attention than others. Otherwise, I would say it, to be honest. Yeah, I think we have a fair shot for sure.”

Dixon, who has been indirectly critical of Palou’s public handling of the situation, also said Ganassi would be fair to its trio of contenders.

“We’re here to win,” Dixon said. “Everybody is trying to win. That’s what I’ve always loved about this team. Obviously, this is a strange situation, and it hasn’t changed for Chip. The pre-race meetings are the same, and all of our cars are trying to win this championship.

“I know Alex is trying to win this championship as much as he can. It’s in his best interest to, as it is all of ours. Yeah, some stuff gets a bit awkward here and there, but we’re all here to win. That makes it pretty simple.”

Palou probably will need a win if he wants another crown. His most recent victory was at Portland nearly a year ago, and his No. 10 Dallara-Honda has been stymied from reaching victory lane this season by a host of driver and team errors.

“I think we started the year great,” he said. “We did a lot of mistakes, and we had a bit of unlucky time at some races, which cost us a lot of points, but everybody has some unlucky races.

“I’m not surprised that we are there because we’ve been doing some great results, but I know I need to win a race. I know it’s coming. I have faith. I know that the work we’re doing is good, and some races that are coming are good for us. Yeah, I have faith that we’re going to win one race this year.”"

That’s later than the schedule is traditionally released, but with so many big names still potentially on the move, setting up a national television schedule is a tricky puzzle (how many times you feature the Brooklyn Nets would depend on where Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are playing, for example).

One thing we do know: The Heat will play the Spurs in a regular season game on Dec. 17 in Mexico City, reports Ira Winderman of the Sun Sentinel. The NBA regularly played a couple of games in Mexico City pre-pandemic and this is a return to that tradition. The NBA also has put a G-League team in Mexico City, the Capitanes, even though it hasn’t been able to play home games there during the pandemic.

This December game will count as a Spurs home game; as an organization they are trying to expand their fanbase and footprint into Mexico.

Mexico City is one of the most underrated cities and tourist destinations in the Western hemisphere, a sprawling metropolis bigger than New York City, with fantastic art, culture, lush parks throughout the city, and — I’ll say from personal experience — street food as good as you will find anywhere. It’s also a city and a region where basketball is growing in popularity.

The challenge for the players will be elevation: Mexico City sits at Mexico City is 7,350 feet above sea level — that’s more than a couple thousand feet higher than Denver’s mile-high experience. Guys will get tired.

Expect the NBA to return to its full effort to make itself a global brand, playing preseason and regular season games around the globe, as the pandemic wanes and life evolves to its new version of normal."

Inside the Irish Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s... Notre Dame 99-to-0: No.","Notre Dame, Marcus Freeman and Tommy Rees may insist a quarterback competition is unfolding in the Irish preseason. Sophomore Tyler Buchner and junior Drew Pyne (pictured above) can wax poetically about the competition not impacting their close friendship. Everyone involved with Notre Dame can parrot the party line.

The Irish beat writers will not take that proverbial memo seriously.

“What you’ll see is Drew and Tyler battle it out,” Freeman said Friday. “They’ll both get reps with the ones and when myself and [offensive coordinator] Rees and the offensive staff feel it’s to a point where there’s a quarterback that’s clearly showed us that he’s the starter, we’ll name him.”

The beat writers feel it has gotten to a point where Buchner has clearly shown he’s the starter.

In the annual “Counting Down the Irish” series, 10 Irish beat writers — actually, this year, nine Irish beat writers and one media member who allows himself this one arena of overreactive fandom — offered their thoughts of who the top-25 most impactful Notre Dame players will be in 2022. The 10 ballots, in an intentionally subjective exercise, elevate Buchner far above Pyne.

That obviously may tie to Buchner’s mobility. It should give Rees more options in designing the Irish offense, something he cannot fully lean into until he knows who his primary passer will be.

“We know some of the things he can do because he showed it last year,” Rees said Saturday. “We want to continue to uncover some of the things, where we can go with all the quarterbacks. … I’m excited to unravel those pieces as camp continues on.”

After viewing just the first Notre Dame practice this fall, the press box’s presumptions were confirmed enough to knock Pyne well into the “Others Receiving Votes” category.

So, to be clear, he did receive votes. Three, to be exact, all as the No. 25 most impactful player of the Irish 2022. That was the exact voting distribution for Buchner a year ago. In that respect, Pyne is viewed as most backup quarterbacks are. In fact, he is far ahead of Phil Jurkovec’s preseason standing in 2019, when the No. 2 quarterback did not warrant a single vote.

Maybe Pyne would have curried a vote or two more if the ballots had not been due shortly after Saturday’s practices, as in interviews afterward, he revealed both a new look and a singular focus this August.

With a mustache that Tom Selleck would acknowledge and a haircut so short his teammates were shocked he paid for it, Pyne has leaned into the ethos of a football-obsessed quarterback.

“I’ve changed my mindset a little bit,” he said. “Coming into this camp and coming into this season, I’ve told myself to just be all business. I can’t let anything affect me outside of football. I can’t let anything in school, I can’t let anything with my friends, I can’t let my girlfriend, video games, anything. I want to be all business.”

Pyne said he spent 17 hours at the football facilities on Friday, catching the last shuttle for the team hotel before 10:00 bed checks. He has removed social media from his phone and, outside of football, talks to only his family and his girlfriend.

“I’m just trying to give everything I possibly can to the team because it deserves it,” he said. “We have a really good football team and there’s no reason for me or Tyler to put ourselves into anything else.”

Maybe that mentality will have an intangible impact that will deserve retroactive votes in this exercise. On the field, though, Pyne is still unexpected to see much action.

Thus, he falls among 10 others in “Others Receiving Votes.” The grouping is highlighted by a pair of freshmen and an unknown receiver, all three of which have already received praise after just one weekend of practices.

Others Receiving Votes:

Freshman receiver Tobias Merriweather — 27 points, five of 10 ballots, high of No. 11.

Sophomore receiver Jayden Thomas — 23 points, six ballots, high of No. 18.

Sixth-year right guard Josh Lugg — 23 points, four ballots, high of No. 16.

Freshman cornerback Jaden Mickey — 22 points, five ballots, high of No. 17.

Senior defensive tackle Jacob Lacey — 18 points, four ballots, high of No. 17.

Junior safety Ramon Henderson — 9 points, one ballot at No. 17.

Fifth-year safety DJ Brown — 8 points, three ballots, high of No. 22.

Junior quarterback Drew Pyne — 3 points, three ballots, all at No. 25.

Junior defensive end Jordan Botelho — 2 points, one ballot at No. 24.

Arkansas State transfer kicker Blake Grupe — 1 point.

Junior safety Xavier Watts – 1 point.

Inside the Irish Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s... Notre Dame 99-to-0: No. 0 Braden Lenzy, fifth-year receiver, one of few healthy...

Rees heaped a high compliment on Merriweather on Saturday, one that featured Rees cutting the thought short so as not to be overly dramatic with the second half of his sentence.

“You see him, this kid’s got a chance,” Rees said, the rest of that sentence presumably being to be great. “It goes way deeper than that. He’s got an unbelievable work ethic. … He’s a kid that’s hungry for it, like he’s gonna do more.”

Merriweather is rooming with Pyne this August, and after Pyne’s 17 hours in the football facilities, he and Merriweather apparently quizzed each other on the next day’s practice after bed checks.

Thomas, meanwhile, is rooming with Buchner. Some time on the stationary bike worried observers on Saturday, but Rees said that was merely a precaution.

“JT’s done a great job,” Rees said. “He’s got to continue to be dependable and be available. I think he’s made big strides in terms of his development and his commitment to what we’re doing. I’m excited about the things he possesses.”

A starting offensive lineman falling out of the top 25 is hardly unprecedented, given it occurred last year with Zeke Correll, but at that time, Correll was not assured a starting role. Lugg is, making his exclusion from six ballots somewhat surprising. After all, he was ranked No. 19 a year ago, and he never lost his starting role. For what it’s worth, as the expected starter at center, Correll was still left off a couple ballots this year, as well.

The voters, generously giving of their time and insights in this annual exercise …

They were voices that carried the weight of history in very different receptacles, but imprinted themselves on generations.
In this same way, Scully remained voluble longer, because his implement of choice was, literally, a microphone (and a camera, though not at the beginning).
In a way, they were polar opposites, and not just because one was a red-haired white man, and the other Black.
But his beginning: Because he was Black man in America, it would be ludicrous to suggest that Russell’s life wasn’t hard.","Over a duration of roughly 48 hours from Sunday evening until Tuesday evening, the voices of first, Bill Russell, and then Vin Scully, were stilled for eternity. This does not mean that we will never hear them again; we surely will. Search, click, listen. ‘Little roller up along first…‘ Search, click, listen. ‘I would kick your ass…’ But those voices will no longer evolve with the world around them, as they once did splendidly and importantly, though very differently – Scully’s mellifluously and comfortably, Russell’s stridently and relentlessly – across lives that lasted 182 years in total. They were voices that carried the weight of history in very different receptacles, but imprinted themselves on generations.

The swift unfolding and discarding of information in our time will quickly and efficiently hasten both men from concurrently celebrated and mourned to concurrently shuffled to the broad expanse of history, where the elegantly faded relevance of a long life shifts inexorably to the hazy equity of legacy. Because this is what the present does to the past, and always has, although more ruthlessly nowadays, where delivery systems pass today’s news into yesterday’s more efficiently than ever. (A process that will only become more efficient).

They were born seven years apart, Scully in 1927 – the peak year of the Ruth-Gehrig Murderers’ Row Yankees – in the Bronx; Russell in the Jim Crow South (Monroe, Louisiana) in 1934, before moving to Oakland at age nine. Their lives would in many ways be tethered to their beginnings (as are all of ours), likely in ways they didn’t comprehend until well into adulthood (same) but embraced both gently (Scully) and forcefully (Russell). They were products of their beginnings, their races, and their chosen professions. In this same way, Scully remained voluble longer, because his implement of choice was, literally, a microphone (and a camera, though not at the beginning). Russell’s was a basketball, and the expiration date comes much sooner, although Russell’s importance long outlived his playing and coaching careers.

In a way, they were polar opposites, and not just because one was a red-haired white man, and the other Black. (Although that distinction is fundamental and vital). In the wonderful remembrances that have poured forth for Scully (and which poured forth upon his retirement in 2016), the word comfortable is omnipresent. Those who listened to his voice while sitting, while driving, while falling asleep in distant times, found comfort in its dependably soothing tones. Russell was not about comfort, and while his dominance as the leader of the Celtics’ dynasty from 1957-’69 brought joy to many, including William Felton Russell himself, it was a different kind of joy, connected to the brutal duality of sports that Russell understood better than all but a few others (Jordan, Belichick, Curry, to start): One wins (usually me), one loses (usually you); the rest is just filler.

Their lives were mirror images: Scully rose to become an icon in a manner that other broadcasters and journalists of all kinds would respect and admire (we love nothing more than to shade our easy lives with tales of when it was much harder, and yes, I froze my sorry butt off at the Union College vs. Ithaca D3 playoff game in 1984, and don’t you forget it). Scully did college football, college basketball, boxing… everything, in the mid- and late 1940s after graduating from Fordham. He once broadcast a frigid football game from the roof of Fenway Park without a coat or gloves, because he had expected to work indoors. Respect.

By the 1950s he was doing Brooklyn Dodgers games with Red Barber and that was a springboard to everything else. In the 70s and 80s, he was everywhere. Not just baseball, where he called Hank Aaron and Kirk Gibson, and sprinkled his broadcast with gentlemanly expressiveness like describing Bob Gibson as pitching “like he’s double-parked,” but also the NFL, where in 1981, he called The Catch, on each occasion rising to meet the moment and then generously getting out of its way.

As a practical matter, the last quarter century of his career was spent mostly with the Dodgers, but something more: He became, almost coincidentally, a steward for something simpler. His measured pace, his delicate wordsmithing, even the cut of his sportcoats and the perfection in his hairstyle, were beloved as counterweights to the noisy world that grew at arm’s length around him, to the catchphrase craze, to hot takes and embracing debate, to the decline of interest in America’s Pastime. He was a time machine, yet at the same time, never more current. Where others shouted to be heard, Scully simply spoke as he always had and we listened. Another word associated with Scully: Treasure. It was a good word.

Few used that word for Russell, and not because he wasn’t, but because it would constitute sanding down his rough edges, and his rough edges were important.

But his beginning: Because he was Black man in America, it would be ludicrous to suggest that Russell’s life wasn’t hard. Of course it was. As my former Sports Illustrated colleague Jack McCallum wrote in his eloquent obituary, “Russell was just 9 when his parents arrived in Oakland, and so he had only a minor sense of the Jim Crow indignities that his parents had suffered in Louisiana. Charles Russell had a shotgun stuck in his face at a gas station, and Katie was told by a policeman to go home and change because she was wearing `white women’s clothing.’ But the son came to know heartache and hard times on his own (his mother died when he was 12), and he would come to know virulent racism, too, especially after he arrived in 1950s Boston, a city that in some ways was not unlike Monroe…”

But athletically, after gawky beginnings, Russell rushed to greatness by dint of raw talent refined and tireless work, the tools of the transcendent. He was fantastically athletic, and applied that athleticism disproportionately to defense and team play throughout his career. He led the University of San Francisco to consecutive national championships in 1955-’56 (and a 55-game winning streak that lasted until John Wooden’s UCLA teams broke it), and was one of the best high jumpers in the world, despite poor technique and little practice. As a professional, he owned both Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West in the column that mattered most to him: Championships.

Through it all, racism followed. As Russell would write in his autobiography, his USF team was hounded on the road and barred from hotels. In Boston, even as he helped build the dynasty, his home in the nice suburb of Reading was vandalized, and the vandals defecated in his bed. He never forgot those moments (nor should he have been expected to): When his jersey was raised to the rafters of the old Boston Garden in 1972, he insisted that only his teammates were present. He didn’t attend his Hall of Fame induction three years later, although later in life he was pulled affectionately back in the NBA world.

What he did was immerse himself among the first generation of activist Black athletes , including Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, Harry Edwards and a young Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, among others. In 2015, I interviewed Brown at his Los Angeles home, and he recalled the summer of 1968, when Russell lived with him in L.A., as their collective activism roiled and grew. “Bill was a serious man,” said Brown, who at that time had been retired for three years, and was himself a serious man, in the extreme. “We talked about the state of the world as Black men in America. A lot of people came to this house.”

If Scully was an every day, every night reminder of a simpler time, Russell was just as much a reminder that times were not so simple, and for some Americans, never had been. He could laugh, a paint-peeling cackle that can’t be forgotten, but it was that seriousness that defined him more explicitly. He understood his reputation: When he was hospitalized in 2018, and then released, he Tweeted: “Thank you everyone for the kind thoughts, yes I was taken to the hospital last night & as my wife likes to remind me I don’t drink enough. On my way home & as most my friends know I don’t have a heart to give me trouble.”

He was also quick to remind any inquisitor that however you choose to frame his legacy (that word), he was the greatest winner ever. Maybe. He’s on the shortest of lists in that debate. It’s not Wilt or West, that much is certain.

His perspective was always essential. As was Scully’s. It’s trite to say that they will both be missed terribly. But it’s irresponsible to leave it unsaid."

Sydney McLaughlin ran the sixth-fastest 400m hurdles time in history in what she said beforehand was her last race of the season.

McLaughlin, who lowered her world record at June’s USATF Outdoor Championships (51.41) and July’s world championships (50.68), ran 51.68 at a Continental Tour meet in Hungary on Monday.

McLaughlin, who turned 23 on Sunday, extended her win streak to seven meets since her last defeat at the 2019 World Championships. Her time on Monday would have been a world record up until the Tokyo Olympics, where she lowered it from 51.90 to 51.46.

Next season is another world championships year. McLaughlin has a bye into next August’s worlds in Budapest in the 400m hurdles as reigning champion but has said she could add or change events, perhaps to the flat 400m, as the 2024 Paris Olympics approach.

Also Monday, Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce won the 100m in 10.67 seconds, giving her the world’s six best times this year.

Fraser-Pryce, 35, has broken 10.70 a total of seven times in her career, all in the last two years after returning from 2017 childbirth, including five times in the last three months. No other woman has broken 10.70 more than four times in a career.

World champion Grant Holloway was upset by Jamaican Rasheed Broadbell in the 110m hurdles. Both ran 13.12, with Broadbell chasing down Holloway, who had a big early lead.

World bronze medalist Erriyon Knighton won the 200m in 19.88 seconds, while world silver medalist Kenny Bednarek pulled up grabbing the back of his upper left leg.

The track and field season continues with a Diamond League meet in Monaco on Wednesday, featuring a 200m showdown among Noah Lyles, Michael Norman, Knighton and, if he’s OK to run, Bednarek. A preview and broadcast information is here.

It airs live on Peacock from 2-4 p.m. ET. CNBC airs coverage Saturday from 1-3.

Lyles, who broke Michael Johnson‘s American record at the world championships last month, is the headliner of the main event of the most prestigious annual track and field competition in Europe.

But there are others on the marquee: Michael Norman, who at last earned his world title in the 400m and could move down in distance for the 2024 Paris Games. Plus 18-year-old phenom Knighton, who took bronze at worlds.

That’s just one of Wednesday’s sizzling sprint fields. World records could also be under threat in other events in Monaco, which has a penchant for producing fast times in distance races.

Here are the Monaco entry lists. Here’s the schedule of events (all times Eastern):

12:30 p.m. — Men’s Long Jump

1:20 — Women’s Pole Vault

1:35 — Women’s Javelin

Here are five events to watch (statistics via Tilastopaja.org and World Athletics):

Women’s 100m — 2:24 p.m. ET

Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce returns four days after running the world’s fastest time this year, a 10.66 that was one hundredth faster than she clocked to win her fifth world title last month. The 35-year-old mom could be pushed to something faster given the additional presence of Shericka Jackson, who took silver in the world championships 100m and gold in the 200m.

Women’s Triple Jump — 2:26 p.m. ET

The deepest event of the meet with the top six returning from the world championships, led by Olympic and world champion and world record holder Yulimar Rojas of Venezuela. Rojas’ lone defeat in nearly three years came in Monaco last year, where Jamaican Shanieka Ricketts got the win. Ricketts is in this field. Ricketts took silver at worlds, but was nearly two feet behind Rojas, who had the three best jumps of the final. The margin separating Rojas from Ricketts was greater than the margin separating Ricketts from sixth place.

Women’s 1500m — 2:32 p.m. ET

Faith Kipyegon, the Olympic and world champion, could take aim at the world record. Last year in Monaco, she lowered her Kenyan record by 2.84 seconds and ran the fourth-fastest time in history. Her 3:51.07 was exactly one second slower than Ethiopian Genzebe Dibaba‘s world record, set in Monaco in 2015. Kipyegon, a 28-year-old mom, ran the six best times of her career in the last 14 months. Her top rivals aren’t in the Monaco field, but Americans Sinclaire Johnson and Elise Cranny will be among those sizing themselves up against the legendary miler.

Men’s 110m Hurdles — 2:47 p.m. ET

Could be a better race than the world championships final won by Grant Holloway over countryman Trey Cunningham. Monaco has those two, plus U.S. champion Daniel Roberts, who was eliminated in the first round at worlds, and Olympic champion Hansle Parchment of Jamaica, who withdrew before the world championships final injured. The only missing man is Devon Allen, who is busy trying to make the Philadelphia Eagles roster.

Men’s 200m — 3:33 p.m. ET

Lyles and Norman go head-to-head for the first time since 2019, when Norman handed Lyles his first outdoor 200m defeat in three years. The 2016 World Junior Championships roommates have since become senior world champions and will look in 2024 to win their first individual Olympic titles. Lyles is entrenched in the 200m. Norman has entertained 200m thoughts, even 100m thoughts, in the past. Now that he’s got a 400m gold medal, the shorter distances may be more appealing. However, there is much more competition there domestically in the form of Knighton, looking for the biggest win of his career.

The contract dispute between the Bears and linebacker Roquan Smith reached a new level on Tuesday.

Smith announced that he has requested a trade from Chicago.

The linebacker issued a statement, via Ian Rapoport of NFL Media, noting that writing the words he’d requested a trade was “deeply painful.”

“Unfortunately, the new front office regime doesn’t value me here,” Smith wrote. “They’ve refused to negotiate in good faith, every step of this journey has been ‘take it or leave it.’ The deal sent to me is one that would be bad for myself, and for the entire LB market if I signed it. I’ve been trying to get something done that’s fair since April, but their focus has been on trying to take advantage of me.

“I wanted to be a Bear for my entire career, help this team bring a Super Bowl back to our city. However, they have left me no choice than to request a trade that allows me to play for an organization that truly values what I bring to the table.”

Smith does leave open the possibility that he could rescind the trade request.

“I haven’t had the chance to talk to the McCaskey family, and maybe they can salvage this,” he wrote, “but as of right now I don’t see a path back to the organization I truly love.”

Per Rapoport, Chicago’s offer was backloaded and wouldn’t make him the highest-paid linebacker in actual salary. Smith was also offended by proposed de-escalators that are not in the contract of any of the 94 non-quarterbacks who are making at least $15 million per year.

Smith is currently on the physically unable to perform list. But he was not planning to practice anyway while in the contract dispute, effectively creating a “hold in.”

The No. 8 overall pick of the 2018 draft, Smith has been a second-team All-Pro in each of the last two seasons. He recorded a career-high 163 total tackles last season, with 12 tackles for loss, 4.0 sacks, an interceptions, and three passes defensed.

In 61 career games, Smith has five interceptions, 14.0 sacks, and 43 tackles for loss."

A Durant trade could impact an Irving trade — almost certainly to the Lakers in a package involving Russell Westbrook and a third team — but the Nets have wanted to finish their Durant business before moving on.","Kevin Durant still wants to be traded, telling that directly to Nets’ owner Joe Tsai in a face-to-face meeting over the weekend in London, plus giving him an ultimatum of me or coach Steve Nash and GM Sean Marks.

The meeting was “professional,” according to Shams Charania of The Athletic, who broke the news.

Durant stated he does not have faith in the team’s direction, sources said… The Nets have direct knowledge of the reasons behind Durant’s request, sources said, and understand that the 12-time All-Star will continue to be resolute in his stance. Durant is believed to want a change of scenery heading into his 16th season.

If this situation drags out, will Durant skip Nets training camp? (Yes.) Could the Nets seriously consider firing their coach and GM to keep their superstar happy? (Tsai hasn’t acted like a guy wanting to go that route, but in the NBA never say never.)

Durant trade talks have stalled out because teams were not offering what Marks and the Nets believed was fair market value for an MVP-level player under contract for four more years (getting a third team involved in the deal has proven difficult). This newly reinforced public trade demand hurts the Nets’ trade leverage even more — why would Boston or Miami increase their offers now? Those teams are still two of the frontrunners to land KD, according to Charania.

The Celtics, Toronto Raptors and Miami Heat remain the most significant candidates to acquire Durant, sources said, with Boston’s package centering around All-Star forward Jaylen Brown seen as a viable deal. Tsai and the Nets have made clear privately that they will take every last asset from a team that trades for Durant, sources said.

Durant’s initial request was to be traded to Miami or Phoenix. After the Suns matched the offer sheet for Deandre Ayton, they removed their only reasonable path to a Durant-level trade (Ayton can’t be traded until Jan. 15 and has veto power over any trade until next summer). Miami’s offer, based around Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson plus up to three first-round picks, has not impressed Brooklyn. Miami has not put Bam Adebayo in any trade talks and shouldn’t be expected to. The Nets have asked for Rookie of the Year Scottie Barnes in any Durant trade with the Raptors. Toronto rejected that idea out of hand.

Jaylen Brown may be the biggest name available to Brooklyn, but the Nets reportedly also asked for Marcus Smart to be part of the trade and that’s where talks ended (the Celtics first offered Brown, Derrick White, and a first-round pick, reportedly adding a little more to the deal later). The Celtics are title contenders without Durant, they don’t need to up their offer to have a good shot at banner No. 18. It’s not a team the Nets can easily leverage in talks.

One of the reasons teams were hesitant to make massive offers for KD — or increase the ones on the table — has been concerns about how long they can keep Durant, despite the four years left on his contract. Marks was the GM who brought Durant and Kyrie Irving to Brooklyn, extended Durant at the max, and did pretty much everything his stars asked, from giving DeAndre Jordan an oversized contract to trading picks and promising young players for a third superstar in James Harden. In large part, Nash is the coach in Brooklyn because Durant and Irving liked him better than Kenny Atkinson (although there are plenty of people in league circles not convinced Nash is up to the job). If the Nets can’t keep Durant happy, who can?

A Durant trade could impact an Irving trade — almost certainly to the Lakers in a package involving Russell Westbrook and a third team — but the Nets have wanted to finish their Durant business before moving on. Irving reportedly wants to play for Brooklyn this season."

Gundy, who had been with the program as an assistant since 1999, announced his resignation in a social media post, and the school confirmed it with a statement shortly thereafter. Oklahoma sent out another statement on Monday giving more details about the incident.

“Coach Gundy resigned from the program because he knows what he did was wrong,” first-year Sooners coach Brent Venables said in the statement. “He chose to read aloud to his players, not once but multiple times, a racially charged word that is objectionable to everyone, and does not reflect the attitude and values of our university or our football program. This is not acceptable. Period.”

Gundy apologized in his post and explained his resignation. He said he noticed a player was distracted while he was supposed to be taking notes, so he picked up the athlete’s iPad and read aloud the words on the screen. He acknowledged that he said a word that he “should never – under any circumstance – have uttered,” and said he was “horrified” when he realized what he had done.

Venables said it tough to see Gundy to leave, but worse for the players to hear that word from one of their coaches.

“As painful as it has been dealing with coach Gundy resigning from the program, it doesn’t touch the experience of pain felt by a room full of young men I am charged to protect, lead and love,” Venables said.

Almost three months after he left the ice without any certainty that he would return, Bergeron signed a one-year deal with the Bruins. A few hours later, the team announced that Krejci, who played last season in his native Czechia, will also be back in 2022-23.

Bergeron got a $2.5 million deal with $2.5 million in incentives and Krejci gets $1 million with the potential for $2 million more. Bergeron is fourth on the Bruins’ all-time scoring list with 982 points, and Krejci is ninth with 730.

Bergeron, 37, and Krejci, 36, led the Bruins to the 2011 NHL championship and two other trips to the Stanley Cup Final. Boston was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Carolina Hurricanes on May 14 and fired coach Bruce Cassidy three weeks later.

Jim Montgomery was hired to replace Cassidy, and the new coach said at his introductory news conference that Bergeron, a five-time Selke Trophy winner, was his first call. Team CEO Charlie Jacobs said Bergeron was expected to return.

“So, fingers crossed,” he said in July.

It worked.

Bergeron has 400 goals and 582 assists in 18 seasons — all with the Bruins, who selected him in the second round of the 2003 draft. Since then, he has established himself as the league’s dominant two-way forward and one of the most respected players in the game.

When he does leave, the Bruins are expected to retire his No. 37, making him the 12th player so honored. He is a likely first-ballot inductee for the Hockey Hall of Fame as soon as he is eligible.

But now that won’t be until at least 2026.

Krejci has 215 goals and 515 assists in 15 years in the NHL — also all with Boston — and led the Bruins in scoring during the 2011 Stanley Cup run with 12 goals and 11 assists in 25 games. Playing for HC Olomouc in his homeland last year, he led the team with 20 goals, 26 assists and 46 points in 51 games.

Bergeron is third in Bruins history with 1,216 games played, and fourth in goals, assists and points. He is second all-time for the Original Six franchise with 47 playoff goals and 123 points.

Bergeron’s 11 straight seasons as a Selke finalist — including this year — is the longest streak of top three finishes for an NHL award, breaking Wayne Gretzky’s record of 10 years in a row as an MVP finalist. (Gretzky won the Hart Trophy nine times.)

Bergeron played 2021-22 without a future contract for the first time in his career, scoring 25 goals with 40 assists and helping the Bruins reach the playoffs for the 14th time in his 18 seasons. They were eliminated by the Hurricanes in seven games.

“That’s why this one probably hurts more, the unknown for next year with him,” forward Brad Marchand, the second-longest tenured player on the roster, said after the Game 7 loss.

“He’s done so much for this group and sacrificed so much,” Marchand said. “It would have been nice to make a good run for him. So, it’s disappointing.”

Bergeron was the last Boston player off the ice in Carolina, leading his teammates through the post-series handshake line with the Hurricanes and then remaining on the ice to give each of his teammates a hug.

But he said he hadn’t decided about his future.

“It’s tough when it ends like that,” Bergeron said after the game. “It stings. It’s not the feeling that you want. But that being said, we did it together.”

Bergeron. Krejci and Marchand are the only players from the 2011 Stanley Cup championship team left on the Bruins roster. Longtime captain Zdeno Chara left as a free agent in 2020 and goalie Tuukka Rask abandoned his comeback from hip surgery in the middle of this season.

The Bruins have 25-year-old David Pastrnak on offense, 24-year-old Charlie McAvoy on defense and 22-year-old Jeremy Swayman in net. Hampus Lindholm, 28, was acquired midseason to shore up the defense, and Marchand is still one of the league’s most dangerous scorers at 33.

But losing Bergeron would have been the end of the most successful era in the team’s history since the Big, Bad Bruins of Hall of Famers Bobby Orr, Phil Esposito, Gerry Cheevers and John Bucyk.

“He’s the backbone of our team. He’s obviously the biggest part of our team,” Marchand said after the playoff exit. “So, yeah, we want him to come back. Whatever happens, he’s earned the right to make whatever decision he wants and take whatever time that he needs.”"

Williams’ Open Era record of 23 Grand Slam titles includes three wins at the French Open, six wins at the U.S. Open, and seven wins at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon.
Her last Grand Slam win came at the 2017 Australian Open, when she was eight weeks pregnant with her daughter Olympia.
Since giving birth, Williams has made four Grand Slam finals (2018 Wimbledon, 2018 U.S. Open, 2019 Wimbledon, 2019 U.S. Open), losing all four times.
She is one Grand Slam win short of Margaret Court‘s record of 24 Grand Slam titles.","Serena Williams is stepping away from the tennis court.

Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam champion, said she plans to retire from tennis in an as-told-to story for Vogue.

“I have never liked the word retirement. It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me,” Williams said. “Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.”

Williams went on to describe how, if she has to choose between tennis and her family, she’s choosing the latter at this point in her life.

“Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family,” she wrote. “I don’t think it’s fair. If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family. Maybe I’d be more of a Tom Brady if I had that opportunity.”

Williams hinted that the 2022 U.S. Open, which begins later this month, will be her last tournament. “But now, the countdown has begun,” she wrote in a related Instagram post. “I’m gonna relish these next few weeks.”

Williams won four Olympic gold medals during her career, including both doubles and singles gold at the 2012 London Games. She is tied with sister Venus for most Olympic gold medals won by a tennis player.

Williams’ Open Era record of 23 Grand Slam titles includes three wins at the French Open, six wins at the U.S. Open, and seven wins at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon.

Her last Grand Slam win came at the 2017 Australian Open, when she was eight weeks pregnant with her daughter Olympia. Since giving birth, Williams has made four Grand Slam finals (2018 Wimbledon, 2018 U.S. Open, 2019 Wimbledon, 2019 U.S. Open), losing all four times. She is one Grand Slam win short of Margaret Court‘s record of 24 Grand Slam titles.

“There are people who say I’m not the GOAT because I didn’t pass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles, which she achieved before the ‘open era’ that began in 1968,” Williams said in her Vogue essay. “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want that record. Obviously I do. But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her.”

Williams has played sparingly in the last year. After withdrawing from the first round of Wimbledon in July 2021 due to injury, she went nearly a year between tournaments, not playing again until this year’s Wimbledon. The 40-year-old lost in the first round to France’s Harmony Tan.

“I know there’s a fan fantasy that I might have tied Margaret that day in London, then maybe beat her record in New York, and then at the trophy ceremony say, ‘See ya!’ I get that. It’s a good fantasy,” Williams wrote.

“But I’m not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment. I’m terrible at goodbyes, the world’s worst. But please know that I am more grateful for you than I can ever express in words.”

The Washington Mystics’ guard was visiting a local kindergarten with her teammates in 2019 when she was approached by a tearful school staffer, pleading for help.

“The librarian just came to me and one of my other teammates and was like, ‘We need your help,'” recalls the 30-year-old Cloud in the latest episode of On Her Turf’s LeadHer series (video embedded above). “And she’s saying this with tears in her eyes and telling us the stories of how three bullets had penetrated their school building in one month. And their representatives weren’t doing anything.

“At that moment, it was just utilizing our platform.”

But Cloud decided to take her efforts a step further following the murder of George Floyd, sitting out the 2020 WNBA season to devote her all of her time to social justice causes.

“It still was probably the hardest decision this far in my life that I’ve had to make was sitting out a season,” said Cloud, who was the 15th overall pick out of by Washington in the 2015 WNBA Draft following her college career at Saint Joseph’s.

“I didn’t feel like I could be a champion on the court and the champion in my community by being removed from my community and not being able to be on the front lines, not being able to be at marches, not being able to sit in rooms that are having these dialogues that need to be had about decisions being made moving forward. I want to be in those chairs.”

However, the time away did nothing to deter Cloud’s value in the league, where she returned in 2021 having signed a three-year, $565,000 contract with the Mystics. She stepped right back into her role as one the team’s lead guards, and in June of this season, Cloud tallied her 900th career assist – reaching the mark in just 193 games (10th fastest in WNBA history).

But while Cloud is still in the throes of her WNBA career, she’s already thinking ahead of life off the court after the league. In particular, she’s aiming to continue her effort as “a voice for the voiceless.”

“We need normal people that understand what it means to be and live in these traumas, to now take leadership to bring solutions and bring truth and honesty and transparency and vulnerability, so I think I want to go into politics,” says Cloud. “I would love to a mayor or even a governor of Pennsylvania, or looking bigger picture down the line, I would love to hold a seat and be able to represent a community that needs true representation and someone that understands what it means to be in their shoes.”

Castle, who hails from West Columbia, S.C., was a rising junior at the University of Kentucky last summer when she defeated University of Arizona All-American Yu-Chiang (Vivian) Hou, 2 and 1, in the 36-hole final. Castle survived a 12-for-2 playoff to qualify for the match-play portion of the tournament, and then proceeded to win her next six matches, including a 19-hole semifinal over then-world No. 2 Rachel Heck.

The NCAA Tournament for women’s basketball is going to a two-host format for its regional rounds next year with eight teams apiece playing in Seattle and Greenville, South Carolina.

Each of those sites will host two regional semifinal games March 24 and two more on March 25. Each site will host one regional championship on March 26 and another on March 27.

In the past, the NCAA Tournament had four regional sites.

Rick Nixon, the NCAA associate director for media, said the committee announced the eventual switch to two regional sites in 2019 and named the host cities in 2020 in an attempt to maintain neutral sites for the regional rounds. The NCAA men’s regionals remain at four sites.

22,nbc,sport,NCAA conferences wrestle with equal pay for women’s basketball referees,"['conferences', 'basketball', 'mens', 'paid', 'ap', 'womens', 'equal', 'ncaa', 'referees', 'equally', 'pay', 'season', 'wrestle']","The NCAA earned praise last year when it agreed to pay referees at its men’s and women’s basketball tournaments equally.
Now, as the NCAA examines various disparities across men’s and women’s sports, pressure is rising to also pay referees equally during the regular season.
Dawn Staley, the head coach for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks — the women’s national champions — said referees on the men’s side should be “stepping up” and advocating for equal pay for women’s referees.
The Pac-12 paid referees equally a decade ago, but allowed a disparity to build over time, according to associate commissioner Teresa Gould.
For example, the SEC paid referees for men’s games 10%, or $350, more than those officiating women’s games.","The NCAA earned praise last year when it agreed to pay referees at its men’s and women’s basketball tournaments equally. The gesture only cost about $100,000, a tiny fraction of the roughly $900 million networks pay annually to broadcast March Madness.

Now, as the NCAA examines various disparities across men’s and women’s sports, pressure is rising to also pay referees equally during the regular season. Two Division I conferences told The Associated Press they plan to equalize pay, and another is considering it. Others are resisting change, even though the impact on their budgets would be negligible.

“The ones that are (equalizing pay) are reading the writing on the wall,” said Michael Lewis, a marketing professor at Emory University’s Goizueta Business School.

The details of NCAA referee pay are closely guarded, but The Associated Press obtained data for the 2021-22 season that show 15 of the NCAA’s largest — and most profitable — conferences paid veteran referees for men’s basketball an average of 22% more per game.

That level of disparity is wider than the gender pay gap across the U.S. economy, where women earn 82 cents for every dollar a man earns, according to the 2020 census. And it is an overwhelming disadvantage for women, who make up less than 1% of the referees officiating men’s games.

Dawn Staley, the head coach for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks — the women’s national champions — said referees on the men’s side should be “stepping up” and advocating for equal pay for women’s referees. “They don’t do anything different,” she said. “Why should our officials get paid less for taking the (expletive) we give them?”

The people who provided AP with data for nearly half of the NCAA’s 32 Division I conferences have direct knowledge of pay scales, and they did so on condition of anonymity because the information is considered private.

The Northeast Conference had the widest per-game pay disparity among the NCAA leagues AP analyzed, with the most experienced referees for men’s games earning 48% more. The Atlantic-10 paid veteran men’s refs 44% more, while the Colonial Athletic Association paid them 38% more. (Only the Ivy League paid veteran officials equally in the data AP reviewed.)

Of the conferences with unequal pay contacted by AP, two — the Pac-12 and the Northeast Conference — said they plan to level the playing field starting next season. A third, the Patriot League, which had a 33% pay gap last year, said it is reviewing equity for officials in all sports. “Pay is part of that,” commissioner Jennifer Heppel said.

The Pac-12 paid referees equally a decade ago, but allowed a disparity to build over time, according to associate commissioner Teresa Gould. She said returning to equal pay is “the right thing to do.”

NEC commissioner Noreen Morris said the decision to equalize pay was an easy one to make once it realized that basketball was the only sport where it was not compensating referees equally.

Relative to the amounts of money these leagues generate, the cost of bridging the pay gap can seem small.

For example, the SEC paid referees for men’s games 10%, or $350, more than those officiating women’s games. Over the course of a season, it would cost the SEC a couple hundred thousand dollars to pay them equally — a sliver of the $3 billion deal it signed with ESPN to broadcast all of its sports starting in 2024."

On Thursday, President Joe Biden again urged Russia to release Griner immediately.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Now that WNBA star Brittney Griner has been convicted of drug possession and sentenced to nine years in prison, attention turns to the prospect of a prisoner swap between the United States and Russia that could get her home.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken went public with that possibility last week, revealing in an unusual announcement that the U.S. had made a “substantial proposal” aimed at securing the release of Griner and another jailed American, Paul Whelan.

With her court case concluded and her sentence pronounced, such a deal — assuming one can be reached with the Russians — is Griner’s best chance of being freed early.

Though the guilty verdict was seen as a foregone conclusion, the imposition of a sentence her lawyers decried as far longer than average could give the U.S. extra impetus to strike a deal palatable to Russia as soon as possible. And the formal end of the court case could be the opening both sides need to forge a diplomatic resolution, too.

A look at what’s at stake:

WHAT DID THE U.S. OFFER?

Blinken did not specify the terms other than to describe the offer as substantial and something that he intended to discuss with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

A person familiar with the situation said that the U.S. offered to release Viktor Bout, a convicted Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year prison sentence on charges that he conspired to sell tens of millions of dollars in weapons to Colombia’s former FARC guerrilla army. At the time of his conviction, the group was classified by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization, though that designation was lifted last year.

The officials did wind up speaking by phone last Friday, the highest-level known contact between the two sides since Russia invaded Ukraine. They are also in Cambodia for meetings involving foreign ministers of Southeast Asian countries.

WHAT HAS BEEN THE RUSSIAN RESPONSE?

Minimal, at least in public. Blinken did not provide details after his call with Lavrov about his response. The Russians gave no hint about their interest in the offer, other than a statement chiding the U.S. to pursue the Americans’ freedom through “quiet diplomacy, without releases of speculative information.”

On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Russian government had responded in a “bad faith” manner with an offer that U.S. officials did not regard as serious. She did not elaborate, though CNN reported last week that Moscow also wanted the release of a former colonel from one of its spy agencies who was convicted of murder in Germany last year.

WOULD THERE BE A PRECEDENT FOR A PRISONER SWAP?

In many ways, yes — and a recent one, too. In April, Russia traded Marine veteran Trevor Reed, convicted of a physical altercation with police in Moscow, for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot imprisoned for a cocaine trafficking conspiracy.

Yet that involved a Russian with far less notoriety than Bout, a former Soviet air force officer who once inspired a Hollywood movie and who earned the nickname the “Merchant of Death” over allegations that he supplied weapons used for civil wars in countries around the globe. He has adamantly maintained his innocence.

But there’s not much recent precedent for public discussions of prisoner swaps, at least by the U.S. government, before the deal is done and planes are in the air. That’s what made Blinken’s announcement from the State Department briefing room all the more striking.

On one hand, it seemed intended to communicate to the public that the administration will do whatever it needs to do to bring home wrongfully detained Americans.

But such a public overture also risks weakening the administration’s negotiating hand to the extent it makes the U.S. look overly desperate for a deal, or signals to other countries that it is willing to meet potentially unreasonable demands.

SO WILL THE DEAL TAKE PLACE?

It’s hard to say, but the contact between Blinken and Lavrov does suggest more progress than has been made before. It also reinforces the idea that the two countries are willing to maintain communication despite extraordinary tensions related to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Griner is the most prominent American detained by a foreign country. She is a two-time Olympic gold medalist detained since February when police said they found vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage at an airport in Moscow. And though some Republicans including former President Donald Trump have expressed opposition to a deal, the conviction and sentence will only ramp up pressure on the administration to reach an agreement that can get her out soon.

“Today’s sentencing of Brittney Griner was severe by Russian legal standards and goes to prove what we have known all along, that Brittney is being used as a political pawn,” Lindsay Kagawa Colas, Griner’s agent, tweeted Thursday.

She said getting a deal done for Griner and Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive imprisoned on an espionage conviction he and his family says is baseless, may be difficult but it is “urgent” and the “right thing to do.” The U.S. government also regards Whelan as wrongfully convicted.

For their part, Russian authorities have suggested that they regard a conviction as basically a prerequisite for a prisoner swap.

On Thursday, President Joe Biden again urged Russia to release Griner immediately.

“My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible,” he said in a statement."

The 31-year-old Griner, a two-time U.S. Olympic champion and a eight-time all-star with the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury, listened with a blank expression as an interpreter translated the verdict by Judge Anna Sotnikova, but her lawyers said later she was “very upset.” Griner also was fined 1 million rubles (about $16,700).

U.S. President Joe Biden denounced as “unacceptable” the verdict and sentence, which came amid soaring tensions between the U.S. and Russia over Ukraine.

“I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates,” Biden said, adding that he would continue to work to bring home Griner and Paul Whelan, an American imprisoned in Russia on an espionage conviction.

Outside court, the U.S. Embassy’s charge d’affaires Elizabeth Rood called the outcome “a miscarriage of justice.”

Griner, recognized as one of the greatest players in WNBA history, has been detained since Feb. 17 after police said they found vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage upon landing at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport. She was returning to Russia, where she has competed since 2014.

As she was led out of court, Griner said: “I love my family.”

The nine-year sentence was close to the maximum of 10 years that Griner had faced under the charges. Most Russians possessing small quantities of drugs get at most five years in prison, lawyers said.

Defense attorney Maria Blagovolina told reporters later that Griner was “very upset, very stressed. She can hardly talk. It’s a difficult time for her.”

Before the unusually swift verdict was reached, an emotional Griner apologized to her family, teammates and the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, where she plays in the WNBA offseason, “for my mistake that I made and the embarrassment that I brought on them.”

With her voice cracking, she added: “I hope in your ruling it does not end my life.”

Griner has 10 days to appeal, and her lawyers say they expect a hearing in Moscow regional court next week. Asked if Griner could ask for pardon from President Vladimir Putin, Blagovolina said they would consider every possibility, but the lawyers said they were not part of any discussions about a prisoner swap.

Griner’s agent Lindsay Kagawa Colas said the sentence “was severe by Russian legal standards and goes to prove what we have known all along, that Brittney is being used as a political pawn.” She added that she supported Biden’s efforts “to get a deal done.”

A conviction is usually needed before arranging a prisoner exchange and also allows Griner to apply for a pardon. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said last month the “necessary judicial procedures” must be completed before other steps can be taken.

The disclosure in July that the U.S. government was seeking a prisoner swap involving Griner reflected the growing pressure on the Biden administration to do more to bring her home. The U.S. State Department had earlier declared Griner to be “wrongfully detained” — a charge that Russia has sharply rejected.

When she took the stand July 7, Griner said: “I would like to plead guilty on the charges against me. But I had no intention of breaking any Russian law.” She added that she brought the vape canisters into Russia because she had packed in haste for her flight.

Griner also described a confusing scene while being held at the airport, saying an interpreter provided by authorities translated only a fraction of what was being said to her and that officials told her to sign documents without explaining what they were. She also said she was not informed of her rights.

Her lawyers introduced evidence that Griner was using the medicinal cannabis for chronic pain and injuries sustained during her career and included a letter from her doctor. Griner testified she was aware cannabis oil was outlawed in Russia and had not intended to break the law or “plan to smuggle anything into Russia.”

Griner’s case and her nearly six months behind bars have raised strong criticism among her supporters in the United States, including her wife, Cherelle, that Biden was not doing enough to win her freedom.

Griner sent a personal appeal to Biden, and more than 1,100 Black female leaders urged the administration to “make a deal to get Brittney back home swiftly and safely and to meet with Brittney’s wife Cherelle immediately.” Biden later called Cherelle Griner “to reassure her that he is working to secure Brittney’s release as soon as possible,” the White House said July 6.

Cherelle Griner, who also spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris, later said she was “grateful to the both of them for the time they spent with me and for the commitment they expressed to getting BG home,” using her wife’s initials.

On July 27, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington has offered a deal to Russia aimed at bringing home Griner and Whelan in a sharp reversal of previous policy. Details of the proposal were not announced, though a person familiar with the matter said the U.S. has offered to trade convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout for Whelan and Griner. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.

Russian media have speculated repeatedly that Griner could be swapped for Bout, nicknamed “the Merchant of Death,” who is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. after being convicted of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and providing aid to a terrorist organization. Russia has agitated for Bout’s release for years.

The severity of Griner’s sentence could give Russia leverage in a swap by increasing pressure on Washington to negotiate her release.

“I think that the harsher the sentence, the more pressure there will be on the Biden administration to make a deal, and obviously they like leveraging that pressure,” Tom Firestone, a lawyer who formerly served as the resident legal adviser at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, said of the Russians before the sentence was imposed.

Even with U.S.-Russia relations at a low point, the two countries managed to arrange a swap in April of Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine detained in Russia, for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot and convicted drug trafficker serving a 20-year prison sentence in Connecticut.

Griner’s detention was made public only after Russian troops moved into Ukraine, as relations between Russia and the United States hit new lows after Washington led the West in bringing sanctions against Moscow.

Her plight has been highlighted by supporters at home, including top athletes, especially after little news emerged about her initial weeks of detention in Russia, where she had limited access to U.S. diplomats. It was only in May that the State Department designated her as wrongfully detained, moving her case under its Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, effectively the government’s chief hostage negotiator.

At the ESPY Awards last month, soccer star Megan Rapinoe referred to Griner as “a political prisoner,” and tennis great Billie Jean King said, “First, bring BG home. Gotta do that.”

NBA Finals MVP Stephan Curry wore Griner’s jersey under his track suit at the awards show and urged “the entire global sports community to continue to stay energized on her behalf.”

Griner, a 6-foot-9 center, has 12 of the 15 regular season dunks in WNBA history and set the single-year record for blocks with 129 in 2014. She led the league in scoring twice. She was a two-time Associated Press college basketball player of the year and led Baylor to a 40-0 season and the 2012 NCAA title. She was the No. 1 pick by Phoenix in the 2013 draft.

The commissioners of the WNBA and NBA called the verdict “unjustified and unfortunate, but not unexpected. … It is our hope that we are near the end of this process of finally bringing BG home.”

“Too many headlines are reading, ‘the first,'” says Bertine.

Other stories went with ‘inaugural’ which is more accurate — definition: “the first in a series of planned events” — but still misleading. “I think the general public just equates ‘inaugural’ with ‘first,'” she says.

For Bertine, this distinction isn’t just about semantics. It’s about making sure history isn’t erased.

Progress in women’s cycling isn’t a straight line

If you want to talk about the “first” women’s Tour de France, you’d have to go back to 1955. That year, 41 athletes competed in a five-stage, one-off race that was contested separately from the men’s competition.

Nearly 30 years later in 1984, Tour de France organizers hosted a women’s race in conjunction with the men’s event, marking the first official Women’s Tour de France. Female cyclists competed on the same — albeit shortened — courses as the male riders.

“It didn’t occur to me that it wouldn’t keep going,” says American Marianne Martin, who won the 1984 Women’s Tour de France. “It definitely felt like the beginning. And this was how it was going to be from now on.”

It wasn’t.

The Women’s Tour de France was held five more times until race organizers dropped female athletes from the program after 1988. While other attempts were made to revive the event in coming decades, the official “Tour de France” name was off limits.

“We had to fight for women to even have access to the name, ‘Tour de France.’ Because that’s what ASO took away in 1989,” Bertine explains.

In 2013, Bertine — along with Emma Pooley, Marianne Vos, and Chrissie Wellington — launched ‘Le Tour Entier’ (French for ‘the Whole Tour’).

They submitted a petition — signed by over 98,000 people — to Tour de France director Christian Prudhomme demanding that women be allowed to race the Tour de France. “While many women’s sports face battles of inequity, road cycling remains one of the worst offenders: fewer race opportunities, no televised coverage, shorter distances, and therefore salary and prize money inequity,” the petition read.

Bertine, whose film ‘Half the Road’ examines gender inequity in professional cycling, says she heard from some athletes who were supportive of the petition, but concerned about retaliation if they spoke out publicly.

“Many were afraid to rock the boat because they were nervous that their own contracts with their teams could be (in jeopardy),” she says. “A number of women reached out to us and said, ‘I’m behind you 100% but I have to remain quiet because I’m worried about my job.”

Tour de France organizer ASO — after initially not publicly engaging with the petition — eventually created “La Course by Le Tour de France,” a one- or two-day women’s race that was held annually between 2014 and 2021.

It is this history that gave Bertine pause when she heard the words “first” or “inaugural” used to describe the 2022 Tour de France Femmes.

“I want Marianne Martin to have her recognition. I want to make that we don’t forget about the women of the 1955 Tour de France. And the women of ‘La Course.’ Because that’s a huge part in understanding how long it took for this race to actually come to fruition.”

In return of Women’s Tour de France, reminders that the work isn’t done

While this year’s eight-stage Women’s Tour de France was more than a “token gesture,” the full mission of “Le Tour Entier” has not yet been met.

“I think being grateful is one of the worst things we could be,” says Lizzie Deignan, a pro cyclist for Trek-Segafredo. “That’s the trap that a lot of women fall into… you have to sometimes be brave and be bold and be outspoken. It’s not always comfortable.”

One of the most glaring disparities between the Women’s and (Men’s) Tour de France is the number of race stages: eight from women, 21 for men. It’s especially stark when you consider the fact that when Martin won back in 1984 — notably, the same summer that female cyclists and marathoners debuted at the Olympics — women raced 18 stages at the Tour de France (compared to 23 on the men’s side).

Many female cyclists also want to see a time trial added. This year’s (Men’s) Tour de France included two.

“I think it would make the race a lot more dynamic and I think it would help create a more well-rounded winner,” Kristen Faulkner told VeloNews.

But equality isn’t as simple as just adding 13 race stages.

“There are complex issues around why the Tour de France Femmes is not three weeks yet,” Deignan says. “It’s never about our physical ability to complete three weeks… Thirty-seven percent of the women’s peloton aren’t being paid a living wage, so to expect them to compete over three weeks — whilst maintaining a job — is just not realistic.”

Which leads to the issue of prize money: For winning, van Vleuten took home €50,000 euros (approx. $52,487 USD) of the total women’s prize pot of €250,000 euros (approx. $262,437 USD). In comparison, men’s winner Denmark’s Jonas Vingegaard received more than $500,000 for his victory last month, while the men’s purse topped $2 million.

When you control for number of days raced, women made 29 cents on the dollar in prize money compared to their male counterparts.

This issue is not unique to the Tour de France. Cycling is further behind than most sports when it comes to equitable pay, though corporate sponsorships — including the one from presenting sponsor Zwift, plus a recent pledge from Strava — have started to bridge the gap.

“It’s about having more professional females on the start line,” Deignan said of Strava’s pledge. “And that’s what we’re missing: the next generation. Those barriers to participation at the professional level are still huge.”

There’s also the issue of race coverage. “They’re only giving (the women) two, two-and-a-half hours of coverage, starting in the middle of the race,” Bertine said of the Women’s Tour de France broadcast. “That’s not ok… especially if the men are getting a full six hours of coverage.”

It is a familiar issue in women’s sports, where there is a long history of investing less money and time in coverage and marketing — and then blaming the players and product for not generating a larger audience.

Deignan, who is currently pregnant with her second child, had a bit of an epiphany while watching the British National Championships at home from her couch.

“(The broadcast) was done with onboard motorbike cameras. That was it. There was no helicopter footage… it was a very basic package and it wasn’t great to watch. And it was like, wow, this is what women’s cycling is like to watch a lot of the time because we just don’t have the same level of production, and production makes a huge difference. Sport is entertainment.”

Deignan, who was born five months after the last Women’s Tour de France was held in 1988, says she’s been inspired by Billie Jean King‘s message of not settling for bread crumbs.

‘It’s taken my full lifetime for us to secure this race again… ” she says. “We have to keep fighting because, as soon as we rest and accept these small steps, that’s when progress pauses again.

“The fight for equality is far from over.”

Last year at the 2021 Women’s Open

Sweden’s Anna Nordqvist ended a nearly four-year win drought last year at the Women’s Open at Carnoustie, where she captured his third career major title. After opening with back-to-back rounds of 71, the 34-year-old Nordqvist vaulted to a share of the lead with a third-round 65. She shot 69 in the final round to finish at 12-under 276, beating Lizette Salas, Georgia Hall and Madelene Sagstrom by one stroke.

Nordqvist came to her 72nd hole tied with Madsen, and her par at the last proved enough after Madsen made double bogey. It was Nordqvist’s first win in four years and marked the ninth LPGA title of her career. Nordqvist will look to become the first player since Yani Tseng (2010-2011) to successfully defend her title since the tournament became a major in 2001.

About Muirfield

This year marks the first AIG Women’s Open to be played at Muirfield, which has hosted 16 men’s Open Championships (most recently in 2013, won by Phil Mickelson), 11 Amateur Championships, two Walker Cups, one Ryder Cup (1973) and one Senior Open Championship (2007).

Par is 72 (36-36), with scorecard yardage for the tournament stretching to 6,680 yards. Of note, Muirfield features 147 bunkers and no water hazards, with the greens, tees, fairways and rough comprised of bent grass and fescue.

While the club was founded in 1744, the course opened in 1891 with 16 holes originally designed by Tom Morris Sr. The course consisted of 117 acres enclosed by a stone wall, and the layout was expanded to 18 holes in 1892 – just in time to host its first Open Championship and first R&A championship that same year. Of note, the 1892 Open also marked the first year the event was contested over 72 holes, and in 1966, Muirfield also became the site of the first Open that was played over four days.

2022 Tour de France Femmes – Stage Details and Results

As the (Men’s) Tour de France came to a close last Sunday in Paris, stage one of the women’s race began at the Eiffel Tower. In total, the 2022 Tour de France Femmes race included eight stages, covering 1,029 kilometers (639 miles).

The eight-day race program had to receive an exemption from cycling’s international federation (UCI) as the organization’s regulations state women’s World Tour races should be a maximum of six days with a maximum individual stage length of 160 kilometers.

History of the Women’s Tour de France

While 2022 welcomed the first Women’s Tour de France in a long time, it isn’t the first time the race has been held. Here’s an abridged history of previous Women’s Tour de France attempts.

1955: The first women’s Tour de France was held as a one-off event and contested separately from the men’s event.

1984: After failing to qualify for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics — the first Olympic Games to include women’s cycling — American Marianne Martin won the first official women’s Tour de France. It was an 18-day race that was held at the same time — and on the same, but shortened, courses — as the men’s event. The event was organized by the Société du Tour de France, which later became part of the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO).

The event was organized by the Société du Tour de France, which later became part of the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO). 1985-1989: The women’s Tour de France continued to be held alongside the men’s race. Italy’s Maria Canins won in 1985 and 1986, before France’s Jeannie Longo claimed three straight titles. After 1989, event organizers decided to drop the women’s event from the Tour de France program.

won in 1985 and 1986, before France’s claimed three straight titles. After 1989, event organizers decided to drop the women’s event from the Tour de France program. 1990-1993: Without sanctioning from Tour de France organizers, a new women’s race was created and held separately from the men’s event.

1992-2009: French Journalist Pierre Boue launched the Tour Cycliste Féminin in 1992. After ASO claimed trademark infringement in 1998, the race’s name changed to the “Grande Boucle Féminine Internationale.” This version of the race also had its fair share of challenges with funding, logistics, and media coverage. The final Grande Boucle in 2009 was the shortest of them all, just four stages and 306 kilometers.

The final Grande Boucle in 2009 was the shortest of them all, just four stages and 306 kilometers. 2013: Emma Pooley , Kathryn Bertine , Marianne Vos , and Chrissie Wellington submitted a petition to Tour de France director Christian Prudhomme demanding that women be allowed to race the Tour de France. “While many women’s sports face battles of inequity, road cycling remains one of the worst offenders: fewer race opportunities, no televised coverage, shorter distances, and therefore salary and prize money inequity,” the petition read.

June 2021: ASO announced that the inaugural Tour de France Femmes avec Swift, an eight-stage race, would debut in 2022.

Van Vleuten, who began feeling sick just hours after stage one on Sunday, was struggling just to eat and drink earlier this week. The two-time Olympic medalist turned things around in the mountains, winning stage seven on Saturday with a dominant solo ride.

The 39-year-old Dutchwoman entered the eighth and final stage of the 2022 Tour de France Femmes with a 3 minute, 14 second lead, but her victory appeared in jeopardy early on Sunday due to mechanical issues that resulted in six bike changes.

But van Vleuten came back. Like she always does.

Six years ago at the Rio Olympics, Van Vleuten was leading the women’s road race and having the best race of her career when she had a horrendous crash on a downhill turn. She was placed in intensive care at a Brazilian hospital, where she was diagnosed with three small spine fractures and a concussion.

Van Vleuten was back on her bike within two weeks and went on to win her first world title in 2017 and two Olympic medals (gold in the time trial, silver in the road race) at last summer’s Tokyo Games.

On Sunday, van Vleuten attacked with six kilometers remaining and went on to win both the stage — a 123-kilometer mountainous climb from Lure to La Planche des Belles Filles — and the 2022 Tour de France Femmes title. (A video highlight is embedded above.)

“That’s actually a dream that comes true,” she said. “It was not an easy stage. It was not an easy week… and even today it was not easy. But to finish here in yellow? Solo? (That’s) the best way.”

Van Vleuten, who has said she plans to retire at the conclusion of the 2023 season, also hinted at the progress still left to be made in women’s cycling.

“I hope it’s a big start for more and that you can build this event to a bigger event for the women, also. Men and women,” she said.

The two-time Olympic medalist, who entered the historic 2022 Women’s Tour de France as the favorite, began feeling sick just hours after the first day of racing in Paris and struggled mightily in the early stages.

“I felt empty,” van Vleuten said on Tuesday after getting dropped multiple times during the third stage of the Tour de France Femmes.

Van Vleuten turned that all around on Saturday, putting on a dominant performance to win stage seven and take hold of the yellow jersey heading into the eighth and final stage on Sunday.

The 39-year-old rode solo for the final 62 kilometers of the 127-kilometer stage, finishing 3 minutes, 26 seconds ahead of fellow Dutchwoman Demi Vollering (Team SD Worx) and 5 minutes, 16 seconds ahead of Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig (FDJ Suez Futuroscope).

“It has been such a rollercoaster after being sick,” van Vleuten told Eurosport. “So to win like this is unbelievable. I had to try because I had lost some time. My style is always attacking, not to wait. I wanted to make the big time gaps which meant going on the first climb.”

After winning Friday’s stage and maintaining the yellow jersey for five straight days, Marianne Vos (Team Jumbo Visma) struggled with Saturday’s race through the mountains, finishing 24 minutes behind van Vleuten. Vos, considered the greatest cyclist of all time and one of the loudest advocates for the return of a women’s Tour de France, still has control of the green jersey (points classification) heading into Sunday.

The fifth and longest stage of the 2022 Tour de France Femmes came down to a final, frantic sprint, with Dutch cyclist Lorena Wiebes (Team DSM) out-lasting Italy’s Elisa Balsamo (Trek-Segafredo) and fellow Dutchwoman Marianne Vos (Team Jumbo Visma) to take the win.

It is the Wiebes’ second stage victory of the 2022 Tour de France Femmes after she won Sunday’s inaugural stage. The 23-year-old currently ranks 53rd in the general classification standings, but second in the points ranking.

“I’m happy to deliver the sprints after a long stage, Wiebes said in her post-stage interview. “It’s still a goal to get the green jersey.”

Vos, meanwhile, remains in control of the yellow jersey with a 20-second gap over Italy’s Silvia Persico (Valcair – Travel & Service) and Poland’s Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon // SRAM Racing). (A video highlight is embedded above.)

Thursday’s stage — a hilly 175-kilometer ride from Bar-le-Duc to Saint-Dié-des-Vosges — included plenty of chaos, including a massive, pile-up crash that took out half the peleton with 45 kilometers remaining. Most riders were able to continue, but Emma Norsgaard Bjerg was forced to abandon.

Victoire Berteau (Cofidis) attacked with just under 22 kilometers to go, with Antri Christoforou (Human Powered Health) going with her. It initially looked like the two cyclists might be able to maintain the breakaway til the finish, but the peloton managed to catch them with three kilometers remaining.

It was also a tough finish for two-time Olympic medalist Elisa Longo Borghini (Trek-Segafredo), who was leading with 500 meters remaining but took a wrong turn.

After the race, Ellen van Dijk joked about her Trek-Segafredo teammate’s mistake on Twitter, writing, “Smart move, @ElisaLongoB, this way you didn’t have to wait for the shower in the bus.”

Van Dijk went on to call out that “there should never be a gap like this in the last 500m without a guard.”"

After two bike changes and one wheel change, she drifted into a support car and went tumbling onto the pavement. Still, the 38-year-old managed to finish the day without losing too much ground and is now 11th in the general classification (+2:26).

Griner was arrested at a Moscow airport in February. She acknowledged in court earlier this month that she had vape cartridges containing cannabis oil when she arrived in Russia but contends she had no criminal intent and the cartridges ended up in her luggage inadvertently.

During her testimony, the Phoenix Mercury standout described making a grueling 13-hour flight to Moscow from Arizona while recovering from COVID-19. Griner said she still does know how the cannabis oil for which she had a doctor’s recommendation ended up in her bag but explained she had packed in haste while under great stress.

She recalled how her luggage was checked upon her Feb. 17 arrival in Moscow and getting pulled aside after inspectors found the cartridges.

Along with the interpreter provided an incomplete translation, Griner said she was offered neither an explanation of her rights nor access to lawyers and was instructed to sign documents without receiving an explanation of what they implied.

After hours of proceedings she did not understand, she was allowed to hand over her personal belongings to a lawyer before being led away in handcuffs, Griner said. She said she received only a cursory translation of the allegations at her during a Feb. 19 hearing where a court sanctioned her arrest.

Griner faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of transporting drugs. Her trial started July 1. and the five previous court sessions so far were short, some lasting only about an hour.

It is unclear how long the trial will last, but a court has authorized Griner’s detention until Dec. 20. She went to Russia to play for a Russian team in the WNBA’s off-season.

During Tuesday’s court session of about 90 minutes, a Russian neuropsychologist testified about worldwide use of medicinal cannabis, which remains illegal in Russia. Griner’s defense team has submitted a U.S. doctor’s letter recommending the basketball player use medical cannabis to treat pain.

Griner testified Wednesday that she was suffering from pain from injuries sustained during her basketball career. She emphasized that cannabis oil is widely used in the United States for medicinal purposes and has less negative effects than some other painkillers

A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said last week that the legalization of cannabis for medical and recreational use in parts of the U.S. had no bearing on what happens in Russia.

The slow-moving trial and Griner’s five months of detention have raised strong criticism among teammates and supporters in the United States, which has formally declared her to be “wrongfully detained,” a designation sharply rejected by Russian officials.

Griner was arrested in February amid high U.S.-Moscow tensions ahead of Russia sending troops into Ukraine later that month. Some supporters contend she is being held in Russia as a pawn, possibly for a prisoner swap. American soccer notable Megan Rapinoe last week said “she’s being held as a political prisoner, obviously.”

Russian media have speculated that Griner could be exchanged for prominent Russian arms trader Viktor Bout, who is imprisoned in the United States, and that Paul Whelan, an American imprisoned in Russia for espionage, may also figure in an exchange.

U.S. officials have not commented on the prospects for such a trade. Russian officials have said no exchange could be discussed until the conclusion of the legal proceedings against Griner."

To quote Danish cyclist Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig (FDJ Suez Futuroscope), Monday’s stage of the 2022 Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift was “f—ing, s— day.”

That made Tuesday’s victory so much sweeter.

The 26-year-old won the third stage — a hilly, 133-kilometer ride from Reims to Epernay — outlasting the nine other cyclists who made it to the final sprint, including stage two-winner Marianne Vos.

“Losing Marta (Cavalli) crashing and having to come back… I just loved how the team kept the fighting spirit,” Uttrup Ludwig said in an emotional post-race interview.

“To actually do it and be a Tour de France stage winner? (Wearing) this jersey? It just doesn’t get better.”

Vos, who finished second on Tuesday, maintains her place at the top of the general classification standings with a 16-second margin.

The biggest surprise of stage three was the performance of Dutch cyclist Annemiek van Vleuten (Movistar Team), the pre-Tour de France favorite who got dropped multiple times. Van Vleuten finished ninth on Tuesday and currently trails in the general ranking by 1 minute, 14 seconds. After the stage, van Vleuten explained that she has been ill for the last 48 hours.

“Two hours exactly after the first stage, I started to feel not good. Could not eat, could not drink. Super tired. All the symptoms apart from fever, otherwise I could not have started. I felt empty,” the two-time Olympic medalist said in a statement provided by Movistar Team.

While van Vleuten said the climbs were especially tough on Tuesday, the 39-year-old noted that she is starting to feel better and was able to eat a “normal breakfast” ahead of stage three. “I’m getting better and better, so I’m happy so far. I can only focus on what I have in control, so I’m now focused on getting better,” she said.

Also notable on Tuesday was the comeback of Dutch cyclist Demi Vollering (Team SD Work), who — along with Germany’s Liane Lippert — crashed with 14 kilometers remaining. Vollering managed to catch back up with the lead group and only finished eight seconds back.

“The roads are just so slippery. It was almost like I was back on an ice track again,” Vollering said with a bit of a laugh.

She continued: “You can lose it every day. You can win it every day. You cannot fall asleep in the race this year.”

After two days of racing at the 2022 Women’s Tour de France, the yellow jersey belongs to Dutch cyclist Marianne Vos (Jumbo-Visma).

Vos, considered the greatest female cyclist in history, won a dramatic uphill sprint, beating out Silvia Persico (Valcar-Travel & Service) and Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon//Sram Racing) at the line. That trio — plus Elisa Longo Borghini, Elisa Balsamo, and Maike van der Duin — pulled away from the peloton with about 17 kilometers remaining.

“I didn’t expect that we would break away and stay away,” Vos said in her broadcast interview. “(The team) brought me perfectly into this bell lap and to this sprint.”

It was a turnaround from Sunday, the inaugural day of the Tour de France Femmes avec Swift, when Vos was out-sprinted at the line by fellow Dutchwoman Lorena Wiebes (Team DSM). Wiebes is now ranked sixth in the general classification after finishing Monday’s stage 29 seconds back.

Stage two — a 135-kilometer hilly ride from Meaux to Provins — saw multiple, nasty crashes in the final 30 kilometers, including one that took out Italian Marta Cavalli.

Cavalli — who won both the Amstel Gold Race and La Fleche Wallonne Feminine earlier this year — initially resumed racing, but later abandoned.

If you waited til the final of the women’s 100m hurdles to tune-in, you missed some big fireworks.

Just under two hours before Sunday night’s final at the 2022 World Track and Field Championships, Nigeria’s Tobi Amusan broke the women’s 100m hurdles world record in her semifinal heat.

Her time of 12.12 seconds took eight hundredths off American Keni Harrison‘s mark from 2016 — the largest world record drop in the women’s 100m hurdles in 42 years.

Amusan, 25, then got back into the start blocks to do it again.

Her time in the final was even faster (12.06), but because of a tailwind of +2.5 m/s, it didn’t lower the world record further.

Amusan is Nigeria’s first ever track and field world champion. The nation — the sixth most populous in the world with 225 million — entered Oregon22 with nine medals in history (four silver, five bronze), and also picked up a silver in women’s long jump on Sunday night thanks to Esme Brume.

“I’ve been that ‘almost girl’ at every championship and finally I can say, ‘God did it!'” Amusan quipped.

Jamaica’s Britany Anderson claimed silver (12.23), while reigning Olympic gold medalist Jasmine Camacho-Quinn of Puerto Rico picked up bronze (12.23). (Video of the women’s 100m hurdles final is embedded above.)

Alia Armstrong, who just completed her sophomore year at LSU, was the top American in fourth.

Tokyo Olympic silver medalist Keni Harrison — after clipping the first hurdle — hit another three down the stretch and ultimately recorded a DQ.

One year after becoming an Olympic gold medalist, Athing Mu is a world champion, too.

Mu won the women’s 800m on Sunday night at the 2022 World Track and Field Championships, holding off Great Britain’s Keely Hodgkinson in a final sprint down the backstretch to cross the line in 1:56.30.

Hodgkinson claimed silver in 1:56.38 — the same 1-2 result as last summer’s Tokyo Olympics — while Kenya’s Mary Moraa picked up bronze with a personal best of 1:56.71. (Video of the women’s 800m final is embedded above.)

After the race, Mu said she wasn’t feeling her best heading into Sunday night’s final.

“I just physically wasn’t where I want to be,” she said. “I knew it was gonna be a little tough… Thankfully I got the gold.”

Both Mu and Hodgkinson are just 20 years old, something the Brit pointed to after claiming silver: “We’ve got many, many years ahead of us.”

She added: “I’m a bit gutted because I was so close, but it is what it is, and we have world champs next year so we’ll go again.”

Ahead of Worlds, Mu said she aims to run the 400-800 double at a future championship, plus “eventually have a world record under my belt.”

After Olympic breakthrough, Athing Mu leads women’s 800m field

The final day of competition features a jam-packed schedule, including finals in the women’s long jump, 800m, 100m hurdles, and 4x400m relay.

In the women’s 800m, the U.S. could win its first ever world title in the event, with the American contingent led by reigning Olympic champion Athing Mu (Trenton, New Jersey). Mu, 20, owns three of the top five times so far this year.

Fellow U.S. teammates Raevyn Rogers (Houston, Texas) and Ajee Wilson (Neptune, New Jersey), who claimed silver and bronze respectively at 2019 Worlds, should also be in the mix. Rogers also won Olympic bronze last summer, while Wilson claimed the indoor world title earlier this year.

Other events to follow: The U.S. should be a top threat in the women’s 4x400m relay, having claimed the last seven Olympic titles and six of the last seven world championship titles in the event. Allyson Felix will compete in the preliminary round (Saturday evening) after U.S. team officials coaxed her out of her brief retirement following last week’s bronze medal in the mixed 4x400m relay.

The women’s 100m hurdles final is expected to feature a showdown between reigning Olympic gold medalist Jasmine Camacho-Quinn, who represents Puerto Rico, and world record holder Keni Harrison.

Allyson Felix‘s final world championship race?

Competition gets underway on Friday at Hayward Field, where all eyes will be on the 4x400m mixed gender relay, which could potentially be Allyson Felix‘s final world championship race. Felix finished sixth in the 400m at U.S. Championships in June, earning her a spot in Team USA’s relay pool.

With 18 world medals and 13 titles, Felix is already the most decorated athlete in track & field world championship history. But the 36-year-old has the chance to extend both of those records in Eugene before officially retiring next month.

While Tokyo silver medalist Raven Saunders missed out on qualifying, the U.S. has two contenders in Chase Ealey (Los Alamos, New Mexico) and Maggie Ewen (St. Francis, Minnesota).

Could the women’s 100m feature another Jamaican sweep?

It’s hard to overhype Jamaica’s strength in the the women’s 100m, which will have its semifinal and final rounds during the evening session on Sunday. The Caribbean island nation will be represented at Oregon22 by the trio of Elaine Thompson-Herah, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson. The three women swept the Olympic podium last summer in Tokyo and appear poised to repeat the feat in Eugene.

Fraser-Pryce, a four-time 100m world champion, owns the fastest three times of the year so far. Thompson-Herah is the two-time reigning Olympic champion in the 100m (and the 200m), while Jackson beat both athletes at Jamaica’s trials last month. Fraser-Pryce and Thompson-Herah have also shown they are in striking distance of Florence Griffith-Joyner‘s long-standing 10.49 world record, set in 1988.

The biggest surprise of U.S. Championships was Sha’Carri Richardson missing the U.S. team in both the 100m and 200m. The U.S. still has a very fast contingent in 2022 U.S. champion Melissa Jefferson (Georgetown, South Carolina), Aleia Hobbs (New Orleans, Louisiana), and Twanisha “TeeTee” Terry (Miami, Florida).

Valarie Allman, best female discus thrower in a generation, aims for first world championship title

Reigning Olympic discus gold medalist Valarie Allman enters Oregon 22 as the favorite, having recorded six of the top ten throws this year. In April, she broke her American record with a 71.46-meter throw, the world’s best mark in 30 years. (As of this writing, the top 69 throws in history were all recorded prior to 1993, including many dubious marks by athletes from countries with organized doping programs.)

Croatia’s Sandra Perkovic, a two-time Olympic champion, could become the first woman to win five world medals in discus.

Other events to follow on Wednesday:

The women’s steeplechase final will be held in the evening. The U.S. has won at least one medal in the event at each of the last four global championships (Olympics/world championships) thanks to the results of Emma Coburn and Courtney Frerichs. They’ll be joined in Eugene by Courtney Wayment, who had a stellar season for BYU that saw her win the NCAA title and break the collegiate record.

Abby Steiner is best U.S. hope in stacked 200m field

The women’s 200m is expected to feature a stacked field. The U.S. contingent is likely to be led by Kentucky’s Abby Steiner, who had a breakthrough performance at NCAA championships, setting a new NCAA 200m record and finishing on the podium in four events (1st in 200m and 4x400m relay, 2nd in 4x100m relay, 3rd in 100m).

Still, Steiner will face tough competition from veteran international stars, including reigning world champion Dina Asher-Smith of Great Britain and the Jamaican trio of Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah. American Tamara Clark also qualified for the women’s 200m final.

Will Sydney McLaughlin break her world record again?

Sydney McLaughlin has revolutionized the 400m hurdles in the last year. At the 2019 World Championships, she crossed the line in what would have been a world record time, if not for U.S. teammate Dalilah Muhammad who claimed the record (52.16) – and world title – by 0.07 seconds.

McLaughlin has since taken control of that world record, breaking it at U.S. Olympic Trials in 2021 (51.90), then at the Tokyo Olympics (51.46), and then again at U.S. Championships in June (51.41).

Dutch athlete Femke Bol is also expected to to be a top threat. Earlier at Oregon22, the 22-year-old powered the Netherlands to a silver medal in the mixed gender 4x400m relay.

In addition to McLaughlin and Muhammad, the women’s 400m hurdles final will also feature Americans Shamier Little and Britton Wilson.

Also on the schedule at Oregon22:

The morning session will feature the women’s 35km race walk.

The evening session will include finals of the women’s 400m and javelin. Two-time reigning Olympic champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo is the favorite in the 400m. She finished as runner-up in 2019 to Bahrain’s Salwa Eid Naser, who is currently serving a suspension for missed doping tests. None of the three Americans — Talitha Diggs, Kendall Ellis, and Lynna Irby — qualified for the final.

Jamaica looks to repeat in women’s 4x100m relay

Jamaica is the heavy favorite in the 4x100m relay, thanks to the likes of Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson, Elaine Thompson-Herah, plus Kemba Nelson. The world record — set by the U.S. at the 2012 London Olympics — could be on notice.

Other events to keep tabs on: the women’s 5000m final, where the U.S. contingent includes Elise Cranny, Karissa Schweizer, and Emily Infeld. Ethiopia’s Letesenbet Gidey, who won the 10,000m earlier this week in Eugene, posted the top time in qualifying.

One year after claiming Olympic bronze, Ethiopia’s Gudaf Tsegay powered through a chaotic final lap to win the women’s 5000m world title on Saturday night.

With flying elbows in the backstretch, Tsegay separated herself from the field to cross the line in 14:46.29. It is the 25-year-old’s second medal of these 2022 World Track and Field Championships after she claimed 1500m silver last Monday. (Video is embedded above.)

Kenya’s Beatrice Chebet nabbed the silver, while Ethiopia’s Dawit Seyaum picked up bronze.

Immediately after finishing, Tsegay was approached and picked up by a fan who had run onto the track with a Tigray flag (a region in northern Ethiopia). The Ethiopian federal government has been accused of committing war crimes and launching a campaign of ethnic cleansing against people in Western Tigray since November 2020.

Citius Mag founder Chris Chavez tracked down the fan, who identified himself as Mearg Mekonnen and as a “voice for the voiceless.”

“There is genocide going on in my country,” he said. “Both of those athletes are from my country, specifically from my area. They’re not able to see their family, their sisters, their fathers. I’m just telling them, ‘You’re ok. You’re good. You did this.'”

World-record holder Letesenbet Gidey, who won the 10,000m earlier at 2022 Worlds, led for nearly the entire race but couldn’t hang on at the end, finishing fifth.

Defending world champ and reigning Olympic gold medalist Sifan Hassan also fell just short, placing sixth. Hassan, as is her signature style, stuck to the back of the pack for the early laps. She made a move at the bell, but faded in the final meters.

Elise Cranny, the top American finisher in ninth, described the race pace as “very fartlek-y.” As for her own performance, “it’s a bit of a mixed bag,” she said. “It’s trying to be happy with taking steps forward. You gotta crack into the top ten first and take those steps… but you also want to get in that top six, top five, eventually top three. So it’s bittersweet.”

Karissa Schweizer recorded a DNF and appeared to be dealing with an injury as she left the track, but her status wasn’t immediately clear. The third American in the final, Emily Infeld, finished 14th.

“Since I’ve been in the sport, I’ve had to inform [people] that there is no women’s Tour de France, like a full-way bike racing tour,” McGowan told On Her Turf.
“I think it’s important that that Strava is investing in women’s racing and not just women’s racing, but just getting women to the starting line of whatever sport that they’re interested in,” said McGowan.
… And there have been a few teams that have men’s teams that have decided to pay their women riders, the same minimums as the men’s riders — and that’s huge.

“Since I’ve been in the sport, I’ve had to inform [people] that there is no women’s Tour de France, like a full-way bike racing tour,” McGowan told On Her Turf. “But now I get to say that we have one, and that I can actually put that on my bucket list of races to participate in. So that’s super exciting.”

But as the first Black American women on a professional road cycling team, the 35-year-old activist and advocate also sees the resurrected race as way to highlight the importance of intersectionality within a traditionally male-led, predominantly white sport.

“From a representation standpoint, I do wish that there was more diversity within the peloton, and I don’t see that happening in this first edition,” said McGowan of the women’s field.

2022 Women’s Tour de France: How to watch, schedule, race history and more

But while it might not be obvious this year in Paris when the Tour kicks off Sunday, she’s optimistic about pro cycling’s future: “There’s just so many opportunities still left to be had, and we’re constantly pushing for change and betterment for the whole process and the whole community. … We’ll get there.”

Her approach starts with a simple, “never-assume” mentality that begins by making sure opportunities are actually presented to communities of color.

“I think there’s a lot of selection that happens before consideration,” said McGowen, who didn’t take up cycling until she was 26 and made her professional debut in September at Tour Cycliste Feminin International de l’Ardeche, where she recorded a seventh-place finish in the sixth stage. “People assume that people of color don’t want to do something, or won’t want to participate in something, or wouldn’t be interested in something.

“I think that is a bias that I wish that the community would get rid of. Because if you do create opportunities — and present those opportunities — oftentimes people will take them and show up.”

She hopes representation will get an uptick from recent developments within the sport over the last two years, including the fact that women’s world tour teams are now required to pay their riders a minimum salary. Additionally, McGowen praised the investment that industry partners including the popular social platform Strava are making not only in women’s sports but also in more equity, inclusion and ease of entry for women looking to participate and excel in professional competition.

“I think it’s important that that Strava is investing in women’s racing and not just women’s racing, but just getting women to the starting line of whatever sport that they’re interested in,” said McGowan. “I think the reason that my my story resonates with so many people is because they can see themselves in it, even if they’re not trying to race bikes. And so I think creating those opportunities and making space for those people and giving the resources to be the community that is trying to build opportunities is super important.

“And as we see that happening, it’s getting more competitive; racing is getting harder,” she added. “It’s getting more interesting because people can dedicate their time to racing instead of also having to work a second job to live and support the career. … And there have been a few teams that have men’s teams that have decided to pay their women riders, the same minimums as the men’s riders — and that’s huge. Because once you start setting that precedent, then perhaps others will follow.”

As for when she’ll target the Tour for her own competition calendar, she’s taking things slightly slower these days after myomectomy surgery in June to remove multiple uterine fibroids.

“Just trying to take it one day at a time,” said McGowan, who hopes to return to cycling in August. “It’s really, really easy to get ahead of yourself. And I’m not one to shy away from lofty goals. But it would be great to race the tour one day, maybe next year… anything can happen is what I have learned over the course of my life.”

Liv Racing Xstra’s team for the Tour de France Femmes includes Italian Rachele Barbieri, Belgian Valerie Demey, and Dutch riders Thalita de Jong, Jeanne Korevaar, Silke Smulders and Sabrina Stultiens.

On her sixth and final throw — while competing in her sixth and final world championships on Friday night in Eugene — Winger won her first ever medal.

“When I got the call, I locked in and refocused,” Felix said.

Felix leaves quite a big footprint on track. In addition to her bounty of medals, she’s also stared down Nike on pregnancy issues during her journey toward becoming an advocate for women’s right. She also started her own footwear company called Saysh.

3 Vollering will arrive with fresh legs, so to speak, having skipped the Giro to focus on the Tour.
“The goal is to ride for the classification in both the Giro d’Italia and the Tour de France and that will be quite challenging,” van Vleuten wrote on her website.
“I think this combination of the Giro and the Tour can go both ways,” said Kopecky, ranked world No.
“There’s two weeks in between, so I think that’s just enough time to recover and have this super compensation in the Tour de France.","With the start of the first Tour de France Femmes just days away, all eyes are on top-ranked Dutch cyclists Annemiek van Vleuten and Demi Vollering, and their decidedly different paths to the inaugural eight-stage race, which kicks off this Sunday.

For the first time in more than 30 years, a women’s peloton will race in Paris the same day as the men, and Netherlands’ van Vleuten looks to lead the inaugural charge after her recent third career win in the Giro d’Italia Donne. She arrives in Paris with the momentum – and the world No. 1 ranking – but fellow countrywoman and world No. 3 Vollering will arrive with fresh legs, so to speak, having skipped the Giro to focus on the Tour.

“I did now only two times in my life the Giro and both times I was not so good coming out of the Giro,” the 26-year-old Vollering said in a June press conference via Cycling News. “So that was the main thing that I made the decision to not do the Giro because I am afraid to come again not super good out of the Giro. That’s something I don’t want to risk.”

2022 Women’s Tour de France: How to watch, schedule, race history and more

“I want to be good on the last two stages at the end of the Tour,” she added. “So I think it will be hard to do a good Giro and then be good again at the end of the Tour.”

But that’s exactly what 40-year-old van Vleuten plans to do as she aims for back-to-back general classification (GC) titles in the women’s grand tours, where she’s chasing some final glory after announcing her retirement at the end of 2023.

“The goal is to ride for the classification in both the Giro d’Italia and the Tour de France and that will be quite challenging,” van Vleuten wrote on her website. “I like to attack, and one-day races are my passion and heart. That passion does not lie in driving for classification, I do it because I can.”

That confidence helped lead van Vleuten to Olympic gold in the time trial and a silver medal in the road race last summer in Tokyo. It’s also propelled her “all-in” perspective on training and downtime: Ahead of her stacked summer schedule, she spent several weeks training in Andorra with Movistar’s men’s team ahead of its bid in the (men’s) Tour de France, and following her Giro victory, she retreated to Italy for two weeks to “chill.”

“The best place to rest mentally is in Italy, at altitude,” she said. “So I’ll go there, invite some friends, have some fun, chill, bike a little, and then I’ll be ready for the Tour.”

Vollering, meanwhile, has spent the last two-plus months almost exclusively training for the Tour and revealed she’s planned her schedule around it since the route was announced last October. She also spent significant periods of time at altitude in and around her home in Switzerland, including at a climbing camp in the Alps.

“I think I can really do hard training by myself, so I do a lot of hard training work,” she said. “My goal is being good at the end of the Tour de France Femmes, so also I have a few stages in front already where I can get a little bit in the racing mood again if that’s needed. But I think this is the best way for me to be there on my best form. Well, I hope that’s the best way. We will find out when I’m there on the start line.”

Vollering’s SD WORX teammate Lotte Kopecky said she can see both sides of the coin, and the Belgian herself chose to compete in the two races.

“I think this combination of the Giro and the Tour can go both ways,” said Kopecky, ranked world No. 5. “There’s two weeks in between, so I think that’s just enough time to recover and have this super compensation in the Tour de France. But I think this combination is really doable, and there are more riders who are doing this.”

Other contenders include the star-studded lineup at Trek-Segafredo, who will look to support the Italian duo of world No. 2 Elisa Balsamo and No. 4 Elisa Longo Borghini with a team that includes time trial world champion Ellen van Dijk, French road champion Audrey Cordon-Ragot, U.S. time trial champion Leah Thomas, and Dutch U23 time trial champion and U23 European time trial and road champion Shirin van Anrooij."

Wilson nearly passed Mu about 50m from the finish line when Mu retook the lead to win by .07 seconds.","Two-time Olympic gold medalist Athing Mu looks to keep her unbeaten streak alive when she makes her World Track & Field Championships debut this week in Eugene, Oregon. The New Jersey native not only arrives as the reigning Olympic champ in the 800m but also as the U.S. record-holder, and the 20-year-old Mu says she’s just getting started.

“In the years to come … I would love to get way faster, way stronger and just way better,” Mu recently told NBC Sports. “I would love to eventually have a world record under my belt. I would love to run a 400 and 800 double and win gold in both of those in a world championship, or just world event, eventually.

“But, right now I’m just thinking about being consistent. I’m hoping to continue to win golds and continue to go faster and to break barriers.”

Since turning professional ahead of U.S. Olympic Trials in June 2021, Mu has won 19 consecutive races in four different events, including heats, semifinals and finals in the 400m, 600m, mile and 4x400m relay. In Tokyo last August, Mu set a new American record in the 800m with a time of 1:55.21, ending a 53-year win drought for Team USA that dated back to Madeline Manning at the 1968 Olympics. Just two weeks later, Mu bettered her time with a 1:55.04 at the 2021 Prefontaine Classic.

2022 World Track and Field Championships: On Her Turf’s day-by-day guide

Mu has posted the two fastest 800m times in the world this year: 1:57.01 at Rome Diamond League and 1:57.16 in the final at nationals. But Mu faced her first real challenge in the distance from veteran Ajee’ Wilson just last month in Eugene. Wilson nearly passed Mu about 50m from the finish line when Mu retook the lead to win by .07 seconds.

“It was a race,” Mu said afterward. “I just kept on running, kept on fighting. I wanted to win. … I definitely love being pushed. I’m happy I reacted the way I did.”

Along with a world championships title, Mu has her eyes set on breaking the world record of 1:53.28, which was set in 1983 by Czechoslovakia’s Jarmila Kratochvilova and remains the oldest-standing individual world record in athletics.

“All that matters is that you go out there and you go get whatever you believe that you can go get,” said Mu regarding her efforts to turn her career into a legacy. “Always be a go-getter and never worry about what you’re up against because, in the end, it really doesn’t matter about anyone else. It’s all about your own personal experience and your own personal journey and as long as you go out there and get after it every single time you hit the track, and are never afraid, I believe that you can do anything.”

But Mu will have to contend with Wilson again in Eugene, where she’s also likely to face Great Britain’s Keely Hodgkinson. The 20-year-old Hodgkinson, who took silver in Tokyo, has a season-best of 1:57.71, but the two have yet to run head-to-head this year. The women were expected to race at the Prefontaine Classic in May, but Mu withdrew citing a bout with COVID-19.

Competition for the women’s 800m begins Thursday, July 21, with heats, followed by semifinals on Friday, July 22, and the final on Sunday, July 24.

COLORADO Springs, Colo. (AP) — U.S. women’s hockey forward Dani Cameranesi announced her retirement from the national team Wednesday.

Cameranesi, 27, helped the U.S. win gold at the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang and was part of the team that came away with silver earlier this year in Beijing. She also played at three world championships and won gold in 2015 and 2019.

“Five-year-old me would be in absolute awe of the things I’ve done, the people I’ve met and the places I’ve seen — all from playing the absolute best game in the world,” Cameranesi said in a statement released by USA Hockey. “I have been fortunate enough to live out my childhood dream and play the game I love at the highest level, but I’ve reached the point in my career where I’m ready to say goodbye. My decision was not made lightly.”

Cameranesi scored 24 goals and added 34 assists for 58 points in 87 games of international competition. She also led the University of Minnesota to four consecutive Frozen Four appearances, winning two national titles, and played the past three years with the Professional Women’s Hockey Players Association.

The Plymouth, Minnesota, native, previously starred at the International Ice Hockey Federation Under-18 Women’s World Championship in 2012 and 2013. Cameranesi said playing for the U.S. gave her the greatest feeling of her career.

“Dani was a key reason for the U.S. Women’s National Team’s success over the better part of the last decade,” USA Hockey director of women’s national team programs Katie Million said. “She consistently brought a tenacious fire on the ice and infectious smile off the ice. We’re grateful for her contributions.”"

That means vice president of women’s basketball Lynn Holzman continues to report to senior vice president of basketball Dan Gavitt.

College sports’ largest governing body hired a third party to evaluate its response to a scathing report issued almost a year ago that criticized gender inequality in the tournaments.

Among the most visible changes noted in the progress report were “March Madness” branding and increased cross-promotion for both tournaments in 2022, as well as the addition of four teams to the women’s tournament to create a “First Four” event to bring it in line with the men’s tournament structure.

The NCAA men’s and women’s basketball committees jointly rejected a recommendation to hold simultaneous Final Fours in the same city, the report said, and NCAA leadership decided against changing the Division I basketball administrative structure. That means vice president of women’s basketball Lynn Holzman continues to report to senior vice president of basketball Dan Gavitt.

An outside firm was hired to conduct the assessment and that the NCAA was honoring the firm’s request to not be identified, as per company policy, NCAA Associate Director of Communications Meghan Durham told The Associated Press in an email.

“The findings of this assessment illustrate our commitment to advance gender equity at NCAA championships. Thanks to a collaborative spirit, significant accomplishments were achieved this past year,” NCAA President Mark Emmert said. “We have said it before — our work is not finished. Gender equity must remain a priority for leaders throughout college sports and we look forward to continuing to support these efforts moving forward.”

The initial report published in August was done by Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP, which was hired after the NCAA failed to provide similar amenities to the teams in the 2021 men’s and women’s Division I tournaments.

The tournaments were played in “bubbles” because of the pandemic, and players blew up social media with complaints that showed disparities between men’s and women’s weight-training facilities, food, lounge areas and gifts — prompting apologies from NCAA executives.

The Kaplan report said the NCAA failed to uphold its commitment to gender equity by prioritizing its cash-cow men’s tournament “over everything else” and put forth the recommendations that the NCAA has enacted or considered.

The issues that women’s players drew attention to have been addressed, the progress report noted. And in addition to the branding improvements, the NCAA increased full-time staff working on women’s tournament; improved communication between men’s and women’s basketball committees; began a program to identify and track areas that need to be the same, comparable and different in men’s and women’s tournament experiences; hired a third party to produce an annual report on gender-equity initiatives; and issued statements on how gender-equity issues are or will be addressed.

The progress report also pointed out the NCAA increased the 2022 women’s tournament expenses budget by $6.1 million and that an additional $1 million would be added.

Among areas in progress: hiring a full-time employee to focus on women’s and gender-equity issues; initiating third-party assessments of gender-equity progress every five years; emphasizing new corporate sponsorships for the women’s tournament; pursuing promotional and marketing opportunities that benefit both tournaments; building on the increased branding visibility with “March Madness” courts and hoops at the women’s First Four and first and second rounds.

In the future, the NCAA is looking to pursue standalone rights for the women’s tournament once existing media and marketing contracts expire in 2024, the report said, as well as hiring a senior vice president for revenue focusing on both tournaments and creating a women’s tournament revenue distribution plan that’s more in line with that of the men’s tournament.

NCAA revenues surpassed $1 billion in the year before the pandemic and almost $900 million of that was tied to the media rights deal with CBS and Turner for the men’s tournament.

The women’s tournament is part of a package with more than two dozen other NCAA championships that ESPN owns and pays about $34 million per year for through 2023-24. But according to an assessment done for Kaplan by a team of sports media and marketing experts, the women’s tournament will be worth between $81 and $112 million annually beginning in 2025."

Griner was arrested in Russia in February after customs officials said they found vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage. She faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted on charges of transporting drugs.

“For me, the most striking thing is that BG’s not here. BG deserves to be free, she’s being held as a political prisoner, obviously,” Rapinoe said while accepting a trophy for best play at the show honoring the past year’s top athletes and moments in sports.

“Like what are we doing here dressed up like we are when our sister is detained abroad? We haven’t done enough, none of us. We can do more, we can support her more, and just let her know that we love her so much.”

“First, bring BG home. Gotta do that,” tennis great Billie Jean King said.

Griner has pleaded guilty in court and acknowledged possessing the canisters but said she had no criminal intent.

Rapinoe urged her fellow competitors to keep Griner’s face and name on social media.

“Every time we say it in interviews, it puts pressure on everybody,” she said. “It puts pressure on the administration, it puts pressure on Russia, it puts pressure on Putin, it puts pressure on everyone, and it lets BG know also above everything that we love her and that we miss her and that we’re thinking about her all the time.”

NBA Finals MVP Stephen Curry hosted the show and joined WNBA players Nneka Ogwumike and Skylar Diggins-Smith in calling attention to Griner’s plight.

“It’s been 153 nights now that BG has been wrongfully detained thousands of miles away from home, away from her family, away from her friends, away from her team,” Diggins-Smith said. “All throughout that time, we’ve kept her in our thoughts and in our hearts even though we know that ain’t nearly enough to bring her home, y’all.”

Wearing her Phoenix Mercury jersey under his track suit, Curry noted the effort being made to free Griner.

“But as we hope for the best, we urge the entire global sports community to continue to stay energized on her behalf,” he said. “She’s one of us, the team of athletes in this room tonight and all over the world. A team that has nothing to do with politics or global conflict.”

They were applauded by Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, who was in the audience at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.

Katie Ledecky takes home ESPY for best athlete, women’s sports

Olympic swimming champion Katie Ledecky won best athlete in women’s sports.

Ledecky earned two golds and two silvers at the Tokyo Games last year, giving her 10 career Olympic medals. She received her trophy from Maybelle Blair, the 95-year-old who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

“I represent one of the few sports that is also a really important life skill, so I want to encourage all the parents here, anyone watching, to make sure your kids learn how to swim,” Ledecky said. “Our planet is 70% water, so it’s very important.”

Billie Jean King honors 50th anniversary of Title IX

King led off a tribute to the 50th anniversary of Title IX, the federal legislation that prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools that receive government funding.

She was joined by Lisa Leslie, Brandi Chastain, Chloe Kim, Allyson Felix, Aly Raisman and Rapinoe, among others. They spoke against a background of black-and-white photos showing women athletes in action, on the field or in the streets advocating for gender equality. Their comments were interspersed with country singer Mickey Guyton performing her songs “What Are You Gonna Tell Her?” and “Remember Her Name.”

The ESPYS were criticized by South Carolina women’s basketball coach Dawn Staley for not inviting consensus player of the year Aliyah Boston to the show. Boston had hoped to attend and was disappointed not to be asked. She was issued a last-minute invitation but declined it.

ESPN said COVID-19 concerns and a smaller venue forced organizers to prioritize invitees to the show. Boston was nominated in a non-televised category that was handed out a night earlier. She lost to Oklahoma softball star Jocelyn Alo, who took part in the Title IX tribute."

Originally published July 14, 2022

Abby Steiner has already enjoyed a whirlwind year ahead of her debut in the World Track & Field Championships next week in Eugene, Oregon.

The 22-year-old Steiner, who hails from Dublin, Ohio, recently finished off her college career at Kentucky in June, winning the 200m NCAA title in Eugene with a time of 21.80 and setting a new collegiate record. She followed up two weeks later in a test with the pros at the USATF Championships and posted a new personal best at the same track with a 21.77, earning her spot on the U.S. team at worlds.

“The main focus was just to come away with a win, make the team,” said Steiner, whose performance took the world lead until Shericka Jackson ran 21.55 the same day at the Jamaican Championships. “It was nice having had NCAAs at this track; it was kind of a familiar environment, so I knew if I replicated my race that I had at NCAAs with nicer weather, we were going to walk away with a PB.”

2022 World Track and Field Championships: On Her Turf’s day-by-day guide

Steiner marked a new milestone on Thursday, turning pro and signing a deal with Puma.

“It’s a weight off my shoulders,” said Steiner via the Columbus Dispatch. “It’s like everything you have worked for is coming to life. I don’t think it’s really sunk in just because it’s such a real blessing. I couldn’t be more excited about my choice, and I can’t wait for this next chapter with them.”

She’s considered the USA’s best hope to get back on the top of the podium in the 200m since Allyson Felix won gold at the 2009 worlds. But she faces deep international competition from Jackson, defending world champion Dina Asher-Smith of Great Britain, and reigning two-time Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah. Namibia’s Christine Mboma, who won silver in Tokyo, will not at compete due to a thigh injury.

“The goal has always remained to be intentional every day at practice and fulfill all the goals I have for myself and see where that can take me and how that can inspire people,” Steiner added. “There’s been a lot of ups and downs along the way, but it’s been a great journey and I wouldn’t change a thing about it.”

But Steiner’s journey was marred this summer by speculation over her professional contract. Over the July 4 holiday, 10 days before Puma announced the sponsorship, a post on Twitter by Sacramento State track coach Kenny McDaniel claimed that Steiner had signed a $2 million deal with Puma. She addressed the conjecture in a personal statement on social media, noting the invasion of privacy has been “some of the most invasive and bothersome narratives I have seen.”

Steiner implored people to do better.

“Please keep in mind that athletes are human,” she continued. “We are worth more than being used in attempts to gain social media likes. A simple DM to me could have prevented false narratives in our track community. As reporters, former athletes, and coach who should understand the pressures athletes face, I urge you to be mindful of this for the next athlete.”

Competition in the women’s 200m begins with heats on Monday, July 18, followed by the semifinals on Tuesday, July 19, and the final on Thursday, July 21.

Allman’s best throw — 68.30 meters — came in the third round. (A video highlight of the women’s discus final is embedded above.)

China’s Feng Bin delivered the surprise of the night, recording a throw of 69.12 meters in the first round that no one else was able to match. Feng was the eighth in qualification and had never thrown farther than 66 meters prior to Wednesday night’s final.

Croatia’s Sandra Perkovic (68.45m) claimed silver to become the first woman to win five discus world medals. Only two women own more world championship medals in an individual event: China’s Gong Lijiao (discus, 7) and Jamaica’s Merlene Ottey (200m, 6).

American women have had tremendous success in the field events at these 2022 World Championships in Eugene. Chase Ealey won gold in shot put, the first American woman to accomplish the feat. Tori Franklin became the first U.S. woman to claim a world medal in triple jump, picking up bronze. And for the first time in world championship history, the U.S. also put two women on the podium in both pole vault (Katie Nageotte, Sandi Morris) and hammer throw (Brooke Andersen, Janee’ Kassanavoid).

The 33-year-old sprinter is now a mom to three children and her goal is to take a victory lap around beloved Hayward Field with all three in tow.

Current women’s 100m hurdles records:","When Nia Ali steps on the track to defend her world title in the women’s 100m hurdles this week in Eugene, Oregon, she’s got even more on the line than she did in 2019. The 33-year-old sprinter is now a mom to three children and her goal is to take a victory lap around beloved Hayward Field with all three in tow.

“Honestly, we talk about pressure — that’s where all the pressure comes from, like, my children,” Ali said in a recent interview with NBC Sports. “They don’t know what I’m doing. They think it’s all fun and games because when they run, it’s fun. When they race people, it’s fun. When they talk trash, it’s fun. They tell me all the time, ‘You’re not that fast. I will dust you.” And I’m like, ‘Here we go.'”

“I always have to keep in mind their eyes and their viewpoint — that they’re looking at it so innocent and to be able to channel that when I go out there, I’m like, ‘That will be my best approach, just channel it like I am them.’ I mean, they have my DNA. I was once that fearless at some point. I once enjoyed it purely. … They really help me in that, and I want to be able to give back in that experience and have it for all of them.”

Sharing a victory lap with her kids has become a bit of a tradition for Ali, who first took eldest son Titus, now 7, on her celebratory spin after winning the 60m hurdles at the 2016 indoor worlds after earning 100m hurdles silver in the 2016 Rio Olympics. After winning gold in the 100m hurdles at the 2019 Worlds in Doha, she carried then-16-month-old daughter Yuri while Titus skipped, danced and jumped along. Now she’s looking to share a similar moment with 1-year-old son Kenzo.

“Right now, he doesn’t know, but when he gets older, I can guarantee it: The other two will brag about their pictures on the internet, so, I’m really just praying I can get back on that podium and just give my best effort for them.”

2022 World Track and Field Championships: On Her Turf’s day-by-day guide

Ali’s inspiration for returning to competition came while watching partner Andre De Grasse, Canada’s reigning Olympic 200m hurdles champion and father to Yuri and Kenzo, compete at last summer’s Tokyo Games.

“I know it’s probably not what most people would expect, but, honestly, I needed that break,” she said. “…Watching Andre compete and just watching so many fast times from people, it gave me the inspiration and the motivation to be able to say, ‘Oh, I can’t wait to get back out there,’ and just constantly find new ways to get better and just up my game.”

Ali, whose season best is 12.49 seconds, faces deep competition from a field that includes reigning Olympic champion, Puerto Rico’s Jasmine Camacho-Quinn, and Tokyo silver medalist and world-record holder Keni Harrison. Oregon22 marks the world championship debut for Camacho-Quinn, a three-time NCAA champion from South Carolina. The 25-year-old has won eight of the nine hurdles races she’s finished this year, including at the Prefontaine Classic in May at Hayward Field. Harrison also won silver at the 2019 worlds and is a five-time national champion.

About Evian Resort Golf Club’s Champions Course:

The Evian Resort Golf Club’s Champions Course now stands as the only women’s major venue never to have moved since the tournament’s inception in 2000 (then known as the Evian Masters) and its designation as a major in 2013. Perched on the hillside between Lake Geneva and the snowcapped Alps, the Champions Course plays to a par 71 (35-36) and stretches to 6,527 yards.

Located in eastern France in the town of Evian-les-Bains, the club originally opened in 1905 with a nine-hole course, and an additional nine was added in 1922. The entire 18 holes were redesigned by Cabell B. Robinson in 1988-90, with significant renovations done by Steve Smyers along with Jeremy Slessor and Dave Sampson of European Tour Design prior to the 2013 Evian Championship.

Tournament course record: 61, set by Hyo Joo Kim in the first round in 2014, and matched by Jeongeun Lee6 in the second round in 2021 and Leona Maguire in the fourth round in 2021.

Last year at the 2021 Evian Championship:

Australia’s Minjee Lee mounted an epic comeback during last year’s final round at Evian Resort, shooting a bogey-free 64 on Sunday to rally from seven strokes back and then beating 54-hole leader Jeongeun Lee6 in a playoff. Lee won with a two-putt birdie on the first playoff hole.

Lee birdied four of her last five holes of regulation to finish tied with Lee6 at 18-under 266. In the playoff, she hit her second shot to 8 feet, while Lee6 hit hers into a creek in front of the green and could not match birdie.

Her successful sophomore year at the University of Florida included not only winning the NCAA titles in the 400m indoor (50.98) and outdoor (49.99) — and helping the Gators secure team titles at both — but also, she captured her first U.S. title in the 400m (50.22) last month at iconic Hayward Field.

“My interpretation of hard work is consistency,” said Diggs, the daughter of four-time U.S. Olympian Joetta Clark Diggs, who competed in five world championships in the 800m. “It’s something that I pride myself on, something that my mother has instilled in me, just putting your nose down and executing and doing what you have to do.”

2022 World Track and Field Championships: Day-by-day guide to the women’s events at Oregon22

That determination is undoubtedly a reflection of lessons learned from her mother, who witnessed first-hand the gradual progression of women’s sports opportunities during her 25-year career thanks to the advent of Title IX.

“When I look out and see my daughter, the fact is watching her train and watching her do doing some of the same things that I did, it brings me a lot of joy,” Clark Diggs recently told NBC Sports. “… When you look at things the way they used to be, and the way they are now, it’s night and day. I think as parents, it’s important for us to talk about the past and try and connect it to the future.”

“My mother always expressed the importance of you know, taking advantage of every single opportunity that you’re afforded,” said Diggs, whose family tree also includes track-and-field standouts Hazel Clark and Jearl Miles-Clark, her aunts, who amassed 11 worlds appearances between them. Fun fact: Diggs’ maternal grandfather is educator Joe Louis Clark, the subject of the 1989 film “Lean on Me” starring Morgan Freeman.

“My mom has been the most consistent person in my life,” added Diggs. “She was really a trailblazer for Title IX and to see you know her daughter reap some of the benefits — I think that she gets to, in a sense, live through me and feel and resonate with my story as I grow up. I wouldn’t be the person I am today without her.”

Four women in the field at worlds have cracked the 50-second barrier this season, and Diggs is one of them. Her winning performance at the NCAA outdoors marked a personal best at 49.99, making her the fifth-fastest collegian ever in the 400m and the youngest American woman to ever run under 50 seconds in the event.

Diggs advanced to Wednesday’s semifinals by finishing second in her heat. Eight runners from the semifinal round will advance to the women’s 400m final, which is set for Friday."

2022 World Track and Field Championships: Day-by-day guide to the women’s events at Oregon22

Three-time reigning high jump world champion Mariya Lasitskene was absent as a result of World Athletics’ ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes following the invasion of Ukraine. Lasitskene previously competed as an “Authorized Neutral Athlete (ANA),” as a result of World Athletics’ other ongoing ban on Russia due the country’s state-sponsored doping program.

Mahuchikh, the 2021 Olympic bronze medalist who evacuated Ukraine, in March, has been supportive of the World Athletics’ ban.

“Russia is an aggressor country that launched a full-scale invasion of my country,” she told the Associated Press. “Many coaches and athletes have gone to the Army to defend our country; some are in hot spots, and some are imprisoned or killed. Sports infrastructure in many cities is destroyed. We can’t train in our native country.”

Mahuchikh won the 2022 world indoor title after a three-day car ride from her home in Dnipro, Ukraine, to Serbia. The 20-year-old has spent most of the last four months living and training in Germany, where her mother, sister and niece also fled. Her father and grandfather stayed behind in Dnipro.

The U.S. women’s national soccer team (USWNT) qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics on Monday night, defeating Canada 1-0 to win the 2022 Concacaf W Championship.

Alex Morgan scored the lone USWNT goal in the 78th minute, converting on a penalty, which was drawn by Rose Lavelle. (Video of Morgan’s goal is embedded below.)

“Before the final, I did speak to Alex about how she feels about taking the penalty, because obviously, she’s going against her club teammate (Kailen Sheridan),” said U.S. head coach Vlatko Andonovski.

“First, she wanted to take it, and her answer was with confidence, which gave me confidence as well. But also, Alex is a big player, and big players are born for big moments. That’s what makes her special.”

It marked a bit of revenge for the USWNT, who were ousted by Canada in the semifinal round at last summer’s Tokyo Olympics – also by a 1-0, penalty winner.

“They gave us a run for our money, but we prevailed and feel good about the performance,” Morgan said in a Paramount+ post-game interview.

With multiple players currently out due to injury and pregnancy, Team USA’s starting lineup in Monterrey, Mexico, on Monday night (and the overall USWNT Concacaf roster) looked remarkably different than that Olympic semifinal loss, with just five overlapping players in the starting XI: Morgan, Alyssa Naeher, Becky Sauerbrunn, Lindsey Horan, and Rose Lavelle.

Canada, the reigning Olympic gold medalist, will now need to win an Olympic play-off game against Jamaica in September 2023 in order to qualify for the 2024 Olympics.

The final moments of the game were rocky for the USWNT — as well as the Paramount+ broadcast, which dropped off during the 91st minute — and the final whistle came after Naeher made a save in the sixth minute of five minutes of stoppage time.

Thanks to their landmark collective bargaining agreement — which secured equal pay with the U.S. men’s team– each USWNT player will take home a paycheck of $120,000 for winning this tournament.

The U.S. and Canada — as well as Jamaica and Costa Rica — also qualified for the 2023 Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand by reaching the semifinal round of the Concacaf W Championship.

How does the 2022 Concacaf W Championship work?

Eight teams, divided into two groups, are competing in the Concacaf W Championship. The tournament kicks off with round-robin tournament within each group:

Group A : United States, Mexico, Jamaica, Haiti

: United States, Mexico, Jamaica, Haiti Group B: Canada, Costa Rica, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago

How do teams qualify for the Women’s Soccer World Cup?

At the end of round-robin play, the top two teams in each group will advance to the knockout semifinal round and, more importantly, qualify for the 2023 Women’s World Cup.

The two third-ranked teams in each group will qualify for an inter-confederation World Cup playoff, which will be held in February 2023.

What about Olympic qualification?

The winner of the 2022 Concacaf W Championship will qualify for the women’s soccer tournament at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The runner-up and third-place teams will qualify for the Concacaf Olympic play-in, which will be held in September 2023.

To put it bluntly: if you don’t finish in the top-three this July in Mexico, you’re out of the Olympics two years from now in Paris.

Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is the fastest woman in the world. Again.

Fraser-Pryce won the women’s 100m on Sunday night at the 2022 World Track and Field Championships in Eugene, Oregon, in a championship record of 10.67 seconds. In doing so, the 35-year-old becomes the first athlete to win five world titles in an individual running event, as well as the oldest world champion in an individual event on the track.

Fraser-Pryce led a Jamaican sweep of the women’s 100m podium, with Shericka Jackson claiming silver in 10.73 (personal best) and Elaine Thompson-Herah picking up bronze in 10.81. (A video highlight of the women’s 100m final is embedded above.)

The three Jamaican women also swept the podium at last year’s Tokyo Olympics, though in a different order (Thompson-Herah, Fraser-Pryce, Jackson). All three are also slated to compete in the 200m — as well as the 4x100m relay — later this week at Hayward Field.

Brooke Andersen didn’t need to take her final attempt in Sunday’s women’s hammer final at the 2022 World Track and Field Championships in Eugene, Oregon. The 26-year-old was already the guaranteed the world title thanks to her fifth-round throw of 77.56 meters.

But Andersen made the most of her victory lap — or victory spin — anyway, launching the hammer 78.96 meters to put an exclamation point on her win. The Tokyo Olympian came just short of her personal best of 79.02, which she set in April.

“I was looking out across the field and I thought to myself, ‘I’m a world champion,'” Andersen said.

Canada’s Camryn Rogers finished as runner-up thanks to her third-round throw of 75.52 meters, while Team USA’s Janee’ Kassanavoid won bronze with a second-round throw of 74.86m. (A video highlight of the women’s hammer final is embedded above.)

After claiming bronze, Kassanavoid — a member of the Comanche Nation — paid tribute to the native land that this year’s World Championship competition is being held on. The University of Oregon is located on the traditional homelands of the Southern Kalapuya. The Kalapuya people were forcibly removed and relocated following an 1855 treaty that dispossessed them of their land.

“It’s super exciting to come out here and have this huge performance — on this huge scale, in front of the United States, on native land, on native soil — and medal,” Kassanavoid said.

American record holder DeAnna Price, the defending world champion, was unable to compete at Hayward Field after testing positive for Covid-19. Price’s 2019 world title marked the first ever for the U.S. in women’s hammer.

Poland’s Anita Włodarczyk, the four-time world champion and three-time reigning Olympic gold medalist, was also missing from the World Championship field. The 36-year-old suffered an injury in June after sprinting after somebody who broke into her car. She caught the thief, but her leg injury required season-ending surgery.

For the first time in history, an American woman is a shot put world champion.

Chase Ealey won Saturday night’s shot put final at the 2022 World Championships in Eugene, Oregon, thanks to a first attempt of 20.49 meters. She is the first women’s shot put world champion to win on her first attempt, according to Olympic sport historian Bill Mallon. (A video highlight of Ealey’s victory is embedded above.)

With the win, Ealey is the first American woman to win a shot put world title since the event debuted in 1983. (In comparison, the U.S. has claimed nine of the 17 world titles ever awarded in men’s shot put.)

Ealey is also the first American to win a world title at these 2022 World Championships, the first time the event has been held on U.S. soil.

China’s Gong Lijiao, the two-time defending world champion and reigning Olympic gold medalist, finished second with her best throw coming on her fifth attempt (20.39m). The Netherlands’ Jessica Schilder finished third with a national record of 19.77m.

The other American women in the final, Jessica Woodward and Maggie Ewen, finished eighth and ninth, respectively.

Ealey’s world championship win marks the end of a rollercoaster last year for the 27-year-old from Los Alamos, New Mexico.

After dealing with a long case of Covid-19, Ealey didn’t qualify for the Tokyo Olympics last summer, finishing fifth at U.S. Olympic Trials. After a training session with Great Britain’s Sophie McKinna in January, Ealey decided to relocate from Arizona to England in order to train with coach Paul Wilson at the City of York Athletic Club. She set a personal best of 20.51 meters in June to win the 2022 U.S. national title.

Ealey’s winning throw of 20.49 is the third farthest by an American woman, trailing only Michelle Carter‘s American record (20.63m) and Ealey’s own personal best.

World record holder Letesenbet Gidey of Ethiopia leaned at the line to take the win at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, clocking 30:09.94, finishing just eight-hundredths ahead of Kenya’s Hellen Obiri and thirteen-hundredths ahead of Margaret Chelimo Kipkemboi, also of Kenya. (Video highlight embedded above.)

Despite being the world record holder, this is Gidey’s first major world title. She claimed 10,000m silver at the 2019 World Championship and bronze at last summer’s Tokyo World Championships. Gidey infamously was expelled from school as a 13-year-old for refusing to run in PE classes, and was only able to return to class when she agreed to participate.

Ahead of the 2022 World Championships, Obiri told Citius Mag she could drop a 60-second final lap in the women’s 10,000m. And she nearly did, clocking 61 seconds over the final 400 meters to claim her fourth world championship medal (and first in this event).

Even more remarkable? Gidey, who is not known for her kick, managed a 60-second final lap to eke out the win.

The Netherlands’ Sifan Hassan, the defending 10,000 world champion, finished fourth.

Despite her tremendous three-medal performance at the Tokyo Olympics — or perhaps because of it — Hassan entered this year’s World Championships as a bit of a mystery. The 29-year-old had only entered one race so far this season, a 5000m in early July, and her manager said she has been recovering from both the physical and mental toll of last year’s Olympic performance. Hassan is still expected to be a threat in the 5000m later this week in Eugene.

In her world championship debut, 21-year-old Ririka Hironaka of Japan pushed out to an early lead by the second lap, a lead that she held until about the halfway point of the race.

The majority of the field stayed together until the final five laps of the race when Gidey and countrywoman Ejgayehu Taye pushed to the front.

Karissa Schweizer was the top American finisher in ninth. The 26-year-old from Urbandale, Iowa, crossed the line in a personal best of 30:18.05. Alicia Monson (Amery, Wisconsin) was 13th, while Natosha Rogers (Littleton, Colorado) also achieved a personal best with a 15th place finish in 31:10.57.

All told, 11 women in the 19-athlete field achieved a personal best during the 10,000m race. Stella Chesang of Uganda, Caroline Chepkoech Kipkirui of Kazhakstan and Rahel Daniel of Eritrea also set national records. Full results are here.

Allyson Felix concluded her career on Friday night at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, with world championship bronze.

Competing in her 10th — and final — world championships, Felix ran the second leg of the 4x400m mixed relay for the U.S. team that included Elija Godwin, Vernon Norwood, and Kennedy Simon.

The U.S. crossed the line in 3:10.16, behind the Dominican Republic (3:09.82) and the Netherlands (3:09.90). Simon, who was fifth at U.S. Championships in the women’s 400m in June, had a lead heading into the homestretch, but was passed in the final meters by Fiordaliza Cofil (DOM) and Femke Bol (NED).

Friday night’s final likely marked Felix’s final world championship appearance. She is not currently expected to compete in the women’s 4x400m relay next week. That said, she does have one final run left: a street race on August 7 in Los Angeles, hosted by Athleta.

Felix entered Eugene with the most track and field world championship medals (18) and world titles (13) in history, but extends her overall medal count to 19 with the bronze. Usain Bolt, the second most decorated track and field athlete in world championship history, retired with 14 world medals and 11 world titles.

Felix also retires with 30 combined global outdoor championships medals (Worlds/Olympics).

Since that plea, her court sessions have focused on in-person and written testimony to her good character and athletic prowess.
At one point, she held up a photo of fellow WNBA players wearing her name and No.
“The attending physician gave Brittney recommendations for the use of medical cannabis,” said her lawyer, Maria Blagovolina.
The State Department’s designation of Griner as wrongfully detained moves her case under the supervision of its special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, effectively the government’s chief hostage negotiator.","KHIMKI, Russia (AP) — A lawyer for WNBA star Brittney Griner at her drug possession trial in Russia on Friday gave the court a U.S. doctor’s letter recommending she use medical cannabis to treat pain.

Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and standout for the Phoenix Mercury, was arrested at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport in February after customs officials said they found vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage. She faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted on charges of transporting drugs.

In court last week, Griner pleaded guilty and acknowledged possessing the canisters but said she had no criminal intent and said they were in her luggage because she packed hastily in her return to Russia to play for the UMMC Ekaterinburg basketball team during the WNBA’s offseason.

In Russia’s judicial system, admitting guilt doesn’t automatically end a trial. Since that plea, her court sessions have focused on in-person and written testimony to her good character and athletic prowess.

Griner wore a Nirvana T-shirt as she sat inside the defendant’s cage that is customary in Russian courtrooms. At one point, she held up a photo of fellow WNBA players wearing her name and No. 42 on their uniforms in tribute during part of Sunday’s All-Star Game in Chicago.

“The attending physician gave Brittney recommendations for the use of medical cannabis,” said her lawyer, Maria Blagovolina. “The permission was issued on behalf of the Arizona Department of Health.”

Medical marijuana is not legal in Russia.

The defense on Friday also submitted tests she underwent as part of an anti-doping check, which didn’t detect any prohibited substances in her system.

The next hearing of Griner’s case was scheduled for July 26.

U.S. President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have said they are doing all they could to win her release, as well as that of other Americans the U.S. considers “wrongly detained” by Russia, including former Marine Paul Whelan who is serving 16 years on an espionage conviction.

Washington may have little leverage with Moscow, though, because of strong animosity over its military operation in Ukraine.

“In the hearings yesterday and today what became very clear is the tremendous amount of respect and admiration both in the United States and here in Russia where Miss Griner has been playing basketball for seven years, not only for her professional achievements but for her character and integrity,” U.S. Embassy charge d’affaires Elizabeth Rood said outside the courthouse in the Moscow suburb of Khimki, where the airport is located.

The director and team captain of UMMC Ekaterinburg testified on her behalf on Thursday.

Russian media have speculated that Griner could be swapped for Russian arms trader Viktor Bout, nicknamed “the Merchant of Death,” who is serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S. after being convicted of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and providing aid to a terrorist organization.

Russia has agitated for Bout’s release for years. But the wide discrepancy in the seriousness of their cases could make such a trade unpalatable to Washington. Others have suggested that Griner could be traded along with Whelan, who is serving 16 years in Russia on an espionage conviction that the U.S. has described as a setup.

The State Department’s designation of Griner as wrongfully detained moves her case under the supervision of its special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, effectively the government’s chief hostage negotiator. The classification has irritated Russia.

Asked about the possibility of Griner being swapped for a Russian jailed in the U.S., Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, the senior Russian diplomat, has noted that until her trial is over “there are no formal or procedural reasons to talk about any further steps.”

Ryabkov warned that U.S. criticism, including the description of Griner as wrongfully detained and dismissive comments about the Russian judicial system, “makes it difficult to engage in detailed discussion of any possible exchanges.”

Griner’s detention has been authorized through Dec. 20, suggesting the trial could last months. Griner’s lawyers, however, said they expect it to conclude around the beginning of August."

“There was so much pure joy in that moment,” recalled Allman in a recent interview with NBC Sports.

“Truthfully, Eugene world championships — I do want to win,” Allman said.","Reigning Olympic women’s discus champion Valarie Allman earned a bye into this week’s World Track & Field Championships thanks to her 2021 Diamond League overall discus title, but that didn’t mean she held back last month at U.S. nationals, where she captured her fourth consecutive U.S. title.

Allman aims keep the momentum rolling next week in her second appearance at worlds, where she’ll look to become the first American woman to win the world discus title. It’s not out of the question for the 27-year-old, who last summer in Tokyo became only the third American woman to capture Olympic gold.

“There was so much pure joy in that moment,” recalled Allman in a recent interview with NBC Sports. “All of the hard work, the sacrifice, the deferred dream, and finally that moment of a dream coming true and being an Olympic champion felt so good.

“And it also felt like such a weight off my shoulders. To have worked so hard for something, wanted it so bad, [to] be the favorite going into the competition, it was a lot to handle. I felt just so grateful that when that moment came, I was able to be at my best. And on the day, it ended up being the best overall.”

The Delaware native has some notable records on her side ahead of this week’s meet in Eugene, Ore., including the North American record of 71.46m (234 feet 5 inches) from this April at the Triton Invitational in San Diego, marking the world’s best throw in 30 years. She also owns the top eight discus throws on the U.S. all-time list and 14 of the top 15, with all the results coming in the last two years.

2022 World Track and Field Championships: On Her Turf’s day-by-day guide

Perhaps the most meaningful record that Allman holds is the Hayward Field record of 70.01m (229 feet, 8 inches), set at last year’s Olympic Trials in Eugene.

“Hayward is incredibly special to me,” she added. “In my athletic journey, I’ve gotten to compete here over 10 times. One of the first times was as a junior, making my first team, representing United States. And honestly, this last one — this past year at Olympic trials, setting the facility record, securing my first time as an Olympian, made to some moments that have deeply resonated with me and helped me find my footing as a professional thrower on the world stage.”

It won’t be easy, however, as Allman faces a loaded field that includes defending champion Yaime Perez of Cuba and four-time worlds medalist Sandra Perkovic of Croatia. The 32-year-old Perkovic, a two-time gold medalist at the Olympics (2012, 2016) and worlds (2013, 2017), is the only woman to have beaten Allman this season (at the Bislett Games in Oslo, Norway, in June) and could become the first woman to win five world medals in discus.

But all comers must first get past Allman, who shared some lofty goals ahead of Eugene.

“Truthfully, Eugene world championships — I do want to win,” Allman said. “I think the next goal is, I want to compete at the best of my ability. In discus, 70 meters is kind of that mark that everyone talks about as really being absolutely elite. And I think if I’m in 70-meter shape, I’ll feel really proud of the result regardless of what color medal that I walk away with.”

The women’s discus throw begins with qualifications rounds on Monday, July 18, with the final set for Wednesday, July 20.

Four-time Olympian Galen Rupp will race the New York City Marathon for the first time on Nov. 6, when five-time Olympian Abdi Abdirahman will race his final career marathon at age 45.

Rupp, 36, and Abdirahman are part of a men’s elite field that also includes defending champion Albert Korir of Kenya, reigning Boston Marathon champion Evans Chebet, Olympic silver medalist Abdi Nageeye of the Netherlands and 2020 London Marathon winner Shura Kitata.

The other standout Americans are 2016 Olympian Jared Ward, Scott Fauble and Leonard Korir.

Eliud Kipchoge, the world’s top male marathoner, will not run New York City. He is committed to the Berlin Marathon on Sept. 25.

Rupp won the 2017 Chicago Marathon and placed second in Boston in 2017 and Chicago last year, plus earned an Olympic bronze medal in 2016.

On July 17, Rupp placed 19th at the world championships in his native Oregon. Rupp said before the race that he missed training time due to a herniated disk and pinched nerve in his back and a mild COVID bout, according to Runner’s World.

“I’m getting better, believe it or not,” Rupp, 36, said that day. “I did the best I could, but I wasn’t able to get all the work in.”

The last U.S. male runner to win New York City was Meb Keflezighi in 2009.

Abdirahman raced the 10,000m at the Olympics in 2000, 2004 and 2008, then the marathon in 2012 and 2021 with a top overall finish of 10th. Last year, he became the oldest U.S. Olympic runner in history.

The New York City women’s field hasn’t been announced, but Kenyan Peres Jepchirchir has committed to defend her title. In a nine-month stretch, Jepchirchir won Boston, New York City and the Olympics, something no other marathoner has done over the course of a career.

I’m entirely confident that Bob’s leadership and training will have me exactly where I want to be for Paris 2024. I believe that, in the long run, this is the best way for me to continue to develop as an athlete.”

Smith, 20, won 200m butterfly silver and 100m backstroke bronze at the Tokyo Olympics, plus silver on the women’s medley relay. In June, she won the world title in the 100m back, three years after winning the 200m back world title.

Smith broke both backstroke world records at the 2019 World Championships, then deferred matriculating at Stanford for one year after the Olympics were postponed by one year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Minnesota native still holds the 200m back world record.

“I am postponing my college degree to maximize my athletic competitive window and could not be more excited for this journey,” Smith said in the release. “I want to thank [Stanford coaches] Greg Meehan and Tracy Slusser, the Stanford staff and my Stanford teammates for their unwavering support and I wish them continued success.”

Bowman, the career-long coach of Michael Phelps, has been the head coach at Arizona State since 2015. His college group includes Frenchman Leon Marchand, who swept the men’s individual medleys at worlds.

Later Tuesday, Olympic 400m individual medley champion Chase Kalisz indicated that he is moving to Arizona to train under Bowman, his coach before he enrolled at the University of Georgia in 2012. Kalisz’s coach at Georgia, Jack Bauerle, announced his retirement in June.

Three U.S. cyclists, including world cup newcomer Kate Brim, scored double victories in the season’s final UCI Para-Cycling Road World Cup this past weekend.



A 23-year-old native of Lowell, Michigan, who began competing just last year, Brim won gold medals in both the women’s individual time trial and road race H2 in her world cup debut in Quebec City.



Samantha Bosco, a two-time medalist in the Paralympic Games Rio 2016, completed a sweep of this season’s world cup races with wins in the women’s time trial and road race C4.



Joining the double-gold party was Clara Brown, a 2020 Paralympian who won both events in the women’s C3 class.



Six U.S. cyclists combined to win 10 medals over four days of competition from Thursday through Sunday. The world cup was the last competition prior to the UCI Para-Cycling Road World Championships, which take place Aug. 11-14 in Baie-Comeau, Quebec.



Brim, a handcyclist, made the U.S. national team after strong performances in the USA Cycling Para-cycling Road National Championships last month in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Since then, she was training in Colorado Springs, Colorado, with Sarah Hammer-Kroening, a four-time Olympic medalist.



“Of all the athletes I’ve come across kind of in that beginning phase, she has some of the most grit and determination that I’ve seen so far,” Hammer-Kroening told woodtv.com of Grand Rapids, Michigan.



Brim won the time trial Thursday, the first day of competition, and followed up with a road race victory Saturday in a winning time of 1 hour, 27 minutes, 49 seconds.



Bosco went six-for-six in winning time trials and road races at all three world cups this year. After winning two Paralympic bronze medals in 2016, she missed last year’s Paralympic Games in Tokyo due to an injury.



She won Sunday’s road race C4 with a time of 1:48:47.



Brown, a two-time world champion, won the women’s road race C3 with a time of 1:32:56 Sunday after winning the time trial Friday.

Battling Austria’s Mona Mitterwallner to the finish line in the final moment, Batten placed third in the women’s cross-country race at the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup held in Mont-Sainte-Anne, Quebec.



The podium finish was Batten’s best in world cup cross-country racing since May 2021 in Czech Republic, when a second-place finish earned her a spot on the 2020 U.S. Olympic Team for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. She finished ninth in her Olympic debut last year, posting the top American finish.



Olympic champion Jolanda Neff of Switzerland won Sunday’s race with a time of 1 hour, 26 minutes, 53 seconds, but the real battle was happening well behind her on the challenging muddy and rocky course at Mont-Sainte-Anne, a ski resort town located northeast of Quebec City.



Batten, a 23-year-old from Park City, Utah, was in second place on the final lap with Mitterwallner just behind her at multiple parts of the course, sometimes with Mitterwallner’s front wheel just inches from Batten’s rear wheel. Mitterwallner caught up to Batten in the final sprint to the finish line. Both recorded a finishing time of 1:27:49, but Mitterwallner passed Batten at the line to capture second place and 200 world cup points.

Harrison won the race in 49.87 seconds, defeating a field that included Olympic bronze medalist Liudmyla Luzan of Ukraine and defending world champion Katie Vincent of Canada.

But since winning in Tokyo, Harrison, now 20, had not been competing. And this week’s world championships was her first international competition since the Olympic Games.



“I took a lotta, lotta time after Tokyo,” she said on the ICF webstream after winning Sunday’s race. “It’s really awesome to back up here and it feels good to be competing with these awesome women again.”



Harrison powerfully sped ahead in the second half of the race and defeated runner-up Maria Corbera of Spain by more than half a second. Wenjun Lin of China won the bronze medal. Vincent was fifth.



High humidity and temperatures in the 80s tested the paddlers.

Viktor Petrenko, the 1992 Olympic figure skating champion from Ukraine, had a monthly stipend revoked by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in part because Petrenko participated in a figure skating show in Russia in July.

On July 9, Ukraine’s figure skating federation revoked Petrenko’s membership and role as vice president.

“The former athlete made his shameful decision despite the bloody full-scale war that Russia has been waging,” the federation said in a statement, according to a New York Times translation, adding that he performed “in the same team with the supporters of this terrible war.”

Those payments can be suspended or revoked for leaving to work abroad, for being penalized by a national or international sports federation or for stopping directly participating in the development of athletes.

Olympic gold medalist Nevin Harrison returned from a post-Tokyo break to win her second consecutive world sprint canoe title.

Harrison, a 20-year-old from Seattle, won the C-1 200m sprint in 49.87 seconds, prevailing by a significant .66 of a second over Spain’s Maria Corbera at Lake Banook, Nova Scotia.

Harrison said it was her first time racing internationally since Tokyo, where she became the first U.S. woman to win an Olympic canoe or kayak title.

“After the Olympics, I kind of crashed,” said Harrison, the lone American to win a canoe or kayak medal at worlds (or the Tokyo Games). “Shaken up [racing at worlds], nervous for sure. I didn’t train as hard this year.”

In Tokyo, Harrison became the second-youngest woman to win an Olympic title in the sport after legendary German Birgit Fischer-Schmidt, whom some consider the greatest female Olympian in history across all sports with 12 medals and eight golds.

At her last worlds in 2019, Harrison became the first American to earn a world championships medal in a sprint canoe event (Greg Barton won world titles in sprint kayak). She did not compete at last September’s worlds, which took place less than two months after the Olympics.

She picked up canoe after hip dysplasia forced her to stop sprinting on the track in 2016.

Also at worlds, New Zealand’s Lisa Carrington swept the individual sprint kayak 200m and 500m. Carrington, 33, has won the 200m at every Olympics and worlds in which she has competed dating to 2011. She has won a 500m medal at every Olympics and worlds she has competed dating to 2013. The 200m comes off the Olympic program in 2024, so her focus will be on the 500m for Paris.

Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce followed her unprecedented fifth world championship in the 100m by running the world’s fastest time this year at a Diamond League meet in Poland on Saturday.

Fraser-Pryce, a 35-year-old mom, clocked 10.66 seconds, one hundredth faster than she ran to win the world title in Oregon three weeks ago. She beat a field that included top Americans Aleia Hobbs (second place, 10.94), Melissa Jefferson (seventh, 11.18) and TeeTee Terry (eighth, 11.20).

It marked the third-fastest time of Fraser-Pryce’s career. Fraser-Pryce, who won the Olympic 100m in 2008 and 2012, has broken 10.70 seconds six times, all since 2017 childbirth. No other woman has broken 10.70 more than four times in a career.

Fraser-Pryce, already the oldest world champion in an individual event on the track, can in 2024 become the first woman to win three Olympic 100m titles and the oldest Olympic champion in any race on the track.

Full Diamond League results are here. The circuit moves to Monaco on Wednesday, live on Peacock.

Also in Poland, American Trayvon Bromell won the men’s 100m in 9.95 seconds into a .7 meter/second headwind. Bromell, the world 100m bronze medalist, edged training partner and world silver medalist Marvin Bracy-Williams, who ran 10.00. Fred Kerley, who led a U.S. sweep of the men’s 100m medals at worlds, did not enter the meet.

Other world champions picked up victories in Poland, including Jamaican Shericka Jackson in the 200m (21.84, distancing Olympic and world 400m champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo (22.35)), Brazilian Alison dos Santos in the 400m hurdles (47.80 in a race that didn’t have rivals Karsten Warholm and Rai Benjamin), American Michael Norman in the 400m (44.11, topping world silver medalist Kirani James by .44) and Swede Mondo Duplantis in the pole vault (6.10 meters, with world silver medalist Chris Nilsen taking fifth with a 5.53-meter clearance).

On mornings that Popovici didn’t have swim practice, his dad queued videos of Michael Phelps‘ races.
Eight days before Popovici turned 9, Tokyo was awarded the 2020 Games, taking place when Popovici would be 15.
But, in a feat reminiscent of a 15-year-old Phelps’ 2000 Olympic 200m butterfly fifth-place debut, Popovici lowered his personal best by .58 of a second.
The next morning in the 100m free heats, Popovici swam the world’s fastest time of the year to that point.","At 17 years old, David Popovici scaled the heights of swimming this summer. He swept the 100m and 200m freestyles at the world championships in Hungary, a nation that borders his native Romania.

Popovici, the youngest man to win a world title in 15 years, knew he could celebrate by doing just about anything he pleased. So he did on that late June night.

“I wanted to eat something good, and I wanted to eat a lot, and I wanted to stay up late,” he said in a poolside interview three days after his last race at Budapest’s Duna Arena, presumably enough time to rest, and to digest more than just the lasagna, duck, seafood and dessert.

After that feast, Popovici did something that speaks to the unique personality of the self-appointed “Chlorine Daddy.”

“I just wandered the streets,” he said.

In a scene reminiscent of Charles Barkley strolling Las Ramblas in 1992 — well, maybe not quite to that scale — the 6-foot-3 kid mingled with Hungarians and Romanians alike, sharing the afterglow of his victories in the dark of night.

“Sometimes,” Popovici said, ruminating in flip-flops in a chair a few steps from the pool, “you need to feed your brain as well.”

Popovici, born and raised in Bucharest, made the move from junior prodigy to, as Romania’s daily sports newspaper splashed it, “King David” at worlds in Budapest, two years before the Paris Olympics.

“You know, my neck is quite heavy because of the medals,” he said, according to FINA. “So I need to strengthen that part for the next meets.”

The link in Popovici’s Instagram bio provides a comprehensive account of his life up to those breakout world championships. His coach since age 9, Adrian Radulescu, confirmed the veracity of such stories as:

Popovici began swimming at age 4 for two primary reasons: His parents hoped it would tire him out. A doctor recommended it to correct early stage scoliosis.

Reminiscent of Ryan Lochte‘s upbringing, Popovici eschewed training by fiddling with his goggles, asking to go the bathroom or saying his head, shoulder or stomach hurt.

“He couldn’t do a push-up, others could do 100,” Radulescu said, according to the report.

He may have acted like Lochte, but he studied another American. On mornings that Popovici didn’t have swim practice, his dad queued videos of Michael Phelps‘ races.

“He would kind of play the expert and tell me, ‘Look how many under waters [kicks] you’re doing. Look at the way he is flying,'” said Popovici, who was born after Phelps already competed in two Olympics and is so young that he only remembers watching live Phelps’ final Games in 2016. “Like a lecture about swimming. Almost every morning, we would watch him, get inspired.”

That Romanian report also noted other ways Popovici’s parents aided his growth. Such as serving breakfast in bed at 4:30 so that he could eat at an optimal time of two hours before practice. Or mixing milk with cinnamon and honey in the trunk of their car at swim meets, leading passers-by to wonder if he was being doped.

Popovici was called “the Magician” for performing card tricks before meets.

His reward after racing was a trip to the local IKEA cafeteria. “Swedish meatballs and cake,” Popovici recalled in the sitdown interview.

He quickly harbored Olympic ambitions. Eight days before Popovici turned 9, Tokyo was awarded the 2020 Games, taking place when Popovici would be 15. Soon after, his parents made him a cake and printed a T-shirt that said Tokyo 2020, according to the Romanian report.

By 2019, he appeared on his way. Popovici was the fastest Romanian man in the 100m and 200m frees with times sneaking in under the “B” standard for Olympic qualification — not competitive for medals, but enough to get to Tokyo if no countryman went faster.

After the Olympics were postponed, you could tell he really got serious just by looking at him. Popovici buzzed off his shoulder-length brown locks — “Swimming makes living with long hair complicated,” he reasoned.

In 2021, he dropped his 100m free personal best from 49.26 to, three weeks before the Games, 47.56, a time that would have won the 2016 Olympics. Two days later, he dipped to 47.30 to become the fastest man in the world for the year going into Tokyo.

In Japan, he finished fourth in the 200m free, missing a medal by two hundredths of a second. But, in a feat reminiscent of a 15-year-old Phelps’ 2000 Olympic 200m butterfly fifth-place debut, Popovici lowered his personal best by .58 of a second. (He later was seventh in the 100m free.)

Then he pasted a link into his Instagram bio of a post-race Romanian video interview.

“The interviewer asked me, ‘How did it feel losing the podium?'” Popovici said, recalling the back-and-forth after his triumphs in Budapest. “And my reaction was simple and natural. It was, ‘I didn’t lose, I won fourth place.’ And that in itself was and still is an amazing accomplishment for our country and for an athlete alone. I sort of humbled the reporter for a second there.”

Romania, the land of Nadia Comaneci and Simona Halep, last produced an Olympic swimming gold medalist in 2004. A Romanian man has never won an Olympic swimming title.

“It’s not that popular,” Popovici said of swimming back home. “The thing is, it will be now a hell of a lot more popular.”

Thanks in part to a 48-hour stretch that put his face on at least one building in Budapest.

On June 20, a confident Popovici intentionally took a seat in the second row of chairs in the pre-race ready room for the 200m freestyle final at the world championships.

“I wanted to be in the back because I just wanted to see the nerves of everyone,” he said on retired Australian Olympian and coach Brett Hawke‘s podcast. “I had my nerves, of course, but I knew people were more scared of me than I was of them. … I just wanted to enjoy that moment of seeing the little bit of fear in their eyes.”

Minutes later, he won the 200m free in 1:43.21, a world junior record and the world’s best time for any age in 10 years. Australian legend Ian Thorpe, who is 39 yet finished his Olympic career before Popovici was born, draped the gold medal around his neck.

The next morning in the 100m free heats, Popovici swam the world’s fastest time of the year to that point. Before that night’s semifinals, Olympic champion and favorite Caeleb Dressel withdrew on unspecified medical grounds. Popovici swam .47 of a second faster in the semis than his heat, then won gold the next day to become the first man or woman to sweep the 100m and 200m free titles since the very first worlds in 1973.

Popovici regretted not racing Dressel in Budapest. He also made it a point to mention a gesture by Dressel from a year ago. At the Olympics, the American came up to the Romanian and congratulated him on his world junior record from earlier that month.

“He’s a cool, chill guy,” Popovici said.

Next week, Popovici headlines the European Championships in Rome, site of his breakout three weeks before the Tokyo Games. In two years in Paris, Popovici could be part of a European revolution in Olympic men’s swimming with Frenchman Leon Marchand and Italian Thomas Ceccon.

Unlike Marchand, who swims for Phelps’ longtime coach Bob Bowman at Arizona State, Popovici is not expected to leave Bucharest for the NCAA, despite having contact with Stanford, Cal and Texas, among other schools.

The goal for his second Olympics: “Be the best version of myself and try and make history,” he said. Any specific history?

“I don’t want to go too much into it,” he said. “But we want to change the world of swimming in our way.”

The sprints are the showcase. In the women’s 200m, world champion Shericka Jackson of Jamaica takes on Olympic and world 400m champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo of the Bahamas.

Jackson ran the second-fastest time in history at worlds, a 21.45 that was 11 hundredths off Florence Griffith-Joyner‘s world record from 1988. Miller-Uibo, who is expected to focus on the 200m for the 2024 Paris Olympics, could push Jackson to chase that 21.34.

The field also includes Americans Gabby Thomas, the fourth-fastest 200m runner in history, and Tamara Clark and Jenna Prandini, who were second and third at the USATF Outdoor Championships two months ago.

Elsewhere, Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce returns after a record-breaking fifth world 100m title. The 35-year-old mom won worlds in 10.67 seconds, which was seven hundredths off her personal best. Only two women have ever broken 10.60 in the 100m — Griffith-Joyner and Elaine Thompson-Herah.

The world record most likely to fall in Poland is in the men’s pole vault. At worlds two weeks ago, Swede Mondo Duplantis broke it for the fifth time since the start of 2020.

Here are the Silesia entry lists. Here’s the schedule of events (all times Eastern):

7:30 a.m. — Men’s Pole Vault

11:52 — Women’s 100m

Here are five events to watch (statistics via Tilastopaja.org and World Athletics):

Men’s Pole Vault — 7:30 a.m. ET

At worlds, the 22-year-old Duplantis became the second-youngest track and field athlete to ever hold an Olympic gold medal, world championship and world record in an individual event (after Ethiopian distance runner Kenenisa Bekele). From here on out in 2022, he’ll try to become the second male pole vaulter in the last 50 years to record an undefeated season with a global title (American Sam Kendricks, 2017). The rest of the top four from worlds is entered, including silver medalist Chris Nilsen.

Men’s 100m — 10:28 a.m. ET

World champion Fred Kerley isn’t entered, but the other three Americans from the world championships final are: silver medalist Marvin Bracy-Williams, bronze medalist Trayvon Bromell and Christian Coleman, who was sixth in defense of his 2019 World title. Bromell, Coleman and Kerley share third place on the U.S. all-time list with personal bests of 9.76 seconds. Kerley is the only man in the world to break 9.80 this year.

Men’s 400m — 11:06 a.m. ET

A rematch between American Michael Norman and Grenada’s Kirani James, the gold and silver medalists at worlds. Norman is working on an undefeated year in the 400m. The only man to beat James anywhere in 2022 is Norman. Americans Champion Allison and Michael Cherry could play spoiler.

Women’s 200m — 11:28 a.m. ET

From 2012 through 2019, Miller-Uibo beat Jackson in all 17 of their head-to-heads. Since Jackson shifted from the 400m to the 100m/200m last year, she won both of their shared finals in the 200m. Jackson’s 200m personal best before she left the 400m was 22.05; she has since run 21.45. Miller-Uibo’s personal best in the 200m, without ever focusing solely on the event, is 21.74 with three more sub-22s. They are both 28 years old. Will this be the start of Miller-Uibo’s two-year chase to overtake Jackson?

Women’s 100m — 11:52 a.m. ET

Fraser-Pryce led a Jamaican sweep at worlds, but her primary challengers here are the three American entrants from worlds: Aleia Hobbs (sixth at worlds), Melissa Jefferson (eighth) and TeeTee Terry (eliminated in the semifinals). Fraser-Pryce, for all of her accolades, is working on what could be her first full season undefeated at 100m (she won all four of her races, all in Kingston, in the pandemic-shortened 2020 campaign). Hobbs was the last U.S. woman to win a Diamond League 100m more than three years ago, marking the nation’s longest drought since the Diamond League’s inception in 2010.

Botswana 19-year-old Letsile Tebogo drew comparisons to a young Usain Bolt for not only breaking a world junior sprint record, but also how he did it — by beginning his celebration some 20 meters before the finish line.

Tebogo lowered his U20 world record in the 100m from 9.94 seconds to 9.91 at the world U20 track and field championships in Cali, Colombia, on Tuesday night.

He raced out to a lead, and by the time the victory was assured, he turned to his right and began wagging his index finger.

In 2008, Bolt won the Olympic 100m final in 9.69 seconds (a world record he’d break the next year). His celebration began at a similar point as Tebogo, wingspanning his arms and then beating his chest as he crossed the finish in Beijing.

In both cases, one of the immediate reactions was to wonder how much faster the sprinter could have gone by running through the line. Tebogo said 9.8, according to World Athletics.

“If somebody took it as disrespect, I’m really sorry. I saw the fans and [it was so] everybody watching at home can enjoy the race – to remind them a little bit about what Usain Bolt did back in the days,” Tebogo said Tuesday, according to World Athletics. “He’s my idol – the person I look up to.”

Bolt may have been watching. Immediately after Tebogo won, the retired Jamaican legend tweeted, “World Juniors I see.”

When Bolt was 19 years old, he had yet to run a competition 100m. He was then the U20 world record holder in the 200m, a label now held by American Erriyon Knighton. Bolt eclipsed 9.91 in his third career 100m, clocking 9.76 at age 21 in 2008. Later that month, he broke the 100m world record for the first of three times.

There is still another junior record for Tebogo to chase before he turns 20 next June 7. Trayvon Bromell remains the fastest teenager in history, running 9.84 a month before turning 20. An athlete cannot set U20 world records in the year they turn 20.

Tebogo is committed to sprint for the University of Oregon beginning next year.

A ban on Russian gymnasts from international competition due to the war in Ukraine will likely keep its Olympic champion teams from qualifying outright for this fall’s world championships.

The European Championships, the lone pathway for European nations to qualify teams for gymnastics worlds in October and November, start next week. Russia and Belarus athletes have been barred by the European Gymnastics federation (UEG) and the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) until further notice since early March after Russia invaded Ukraine.

When asked if Russia could be reinstated in time to compete at the European Championships that start Aug. 11 in Munich, a UEG spokesperson responded with text from and a link to the early March ban announcement. The competition’s detailed gymnastics schedule does not include Russia in its list of participating nations.

Russia’s gymnastics federation appealed both the UEG and FIG bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). When asked if a decision on the appeals was expected before the European Championships, a CAS spokesperson said Tuesday, “The procedures are ongoing and the decisions are not expected to be announced in the coming days.”

When asked how, if at all, Russia can qualify teams for the world championships without participating at the European Championships, an FIG spokesperson noted the current ban and said the federation will not comment further “as a CAS decision is awaited.”

Last week, the head of Russia’s gymnastics federation reportedly said there is no chance Russian gymnasts will be allowed to compete at worlds.

Bans on Russian athletes in most Olympic sports kept them out of other world championships this summer, including in aquatics and track and field.

Long before the Russian bans, the FIG changed its qualification system for the team event at world championships starting this year. In the past, any nation could compete in the team event at the worlds taking place two years before the Olympics (barring banned athletes and federations, of course).

Now, the 2022 World Championships field is capped at 24 teams, all qualifying via continental meets such as the European Championships.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, the IOC called for Russian and Belarusian athletes to be barred indefinitely from international competition to protect the integrity of the events and the safety of the other participants.

Russia’s ability to qualify gymnastics teams for the 2024 Paris Olympics will not be significantly impacted unless the ban extends to major 2023 competitions.

Last year, Russians won the Olympic men’s gymnastics team title for the first time since 1996 and the women’s team title for the first time since Russia began competing on its own after the 1992 Barcelona Games.

Russians competed in Tokyo as the Russian Olympic Committee team as the nation’s name, flag and anthem were banned due to Russia’s well-publicized anti-doping violations.

He ranks second in the world this year behind 17-year-old Romanian David Popovici, who swam 47.13 at June’s world championships.
In the 100m butterfly at that meet, Chalmers took second and Simpson took third.
Then at the meet (and before the 100m fly final), Chalmers said he had not made up his mind.
“I do nothing but be positive,” Chalmers said, according to the report.","Olympic champion Kyle Chalmers won his signature race at the Commonwealth Games, then celebrated with a shush two days after saying recent “false headlines” about his relationship with Australian teammates threatened his future in swimming.

Chalmers took the 100m free on Monday in 47.51 seconds, a day after recording a Commonwealth Games record 47.36 in the semifinals in Birmingham, Great Britain. He ranks second in the world this year behind 17-year-old Romanian David Popovici, who swam 47.13 at June’s world championships.

“It’s special to win, but unfortunately, I think it’s hard to enjoy the moment when all that’s happened has gone on,” Chalmers said on Australia’s Seven Network. “It makes it a very, very challenging time. I’m grateful that I was able to block it out enough to stand up and win tonight, but I just hope this is a learning point for everyone where no one else has to go through what I’ve had to go through the last couple of days.

“There was points where I thought that I wouldn’t continue on and do the race, but that just lets the media win, right?”

Chalmers, who took 100m free gold and silver at the last two Olympics, was referring to headlines and media questions toward him at the Commonwealth Games about fellow Australian swimmers Emma McKeon, his former girlfriend, and Cody Simpson, who is now dating McKeon.

Earlier, Chalmers shared a Sydney Morning Herald article that reported that other media accused Chalmers of not congratulating McKeon after they were on the victorious mixed 4x100m free relay team Friday.

“Did you watch the whole race?” Chalmers said, according to the newspaper. “I said congratulations and we [McKeon] stood here right alongside you guys and spoke last night. I find that really hard to believe that I didn’t say congratulations after the race.”

McKeon said that Chalmers did shake her hand, according to the Herald, saying, “He did [congratulate me]. We always put a good team together, and mixed relays are always fun.”

Chalmers said the headlines date back to May’s Australian trials. In the 100m butterfly at that meet, Chalmers took second and Simpson took third. Chalmers said before the meet that he planned to skip the world championships, which would have meant Simpson was upgraded to the second and final spot on the world championships team in the event.

Then at the meet (and before the 100m fly final), Chalmers said he had not made up his mind. After the 100m fly final, he decided to take the spot, which meant that Simpson, a pop star who returned to swimming in 2020 after a decade break, would not be on the world team (but would make Commonwealths, where a nation can enter three swimmers per individual event).

“I ask that you please stop writing these false headlines otherwise my time in the sport will be finished,” Chalmers shared on social media on Saturday. “This could end my time in swimming, I hope you are all aware. My mental health right now from all of this over the months is at rock bottom, I really hope that pleases the key board warriors that continue to write false news. Thank you again for the people who love, care and support me. You’ve been there for me everyday through this journey.. and without you I would not have been standing here racing. I would have been retired, but you motivated me, inspired me and helped me get through this battle. For that I am forever grateful.”

Back in May, Simpson said that he and Chalmers “cleared the air” after Chalmers’ decision to take the spot and that “it was all good.”

“He changed his mind, which he has every right to do,” Simpson said then on Amazon Prime. “I respect his decision either way.”

Chalmers said at Commonwealths that he tells Simpson “good luck” and has messaged him post-race, according to the Herald.

“I do nothing but be positive,” Chalmers said, according to the report. “I try and support him on the team but again, people just want clickbait.”

Australia broke the women’s 4x200m freestyle relay world record and Adam Peaty lost a 100m breaststroke at a major international meet for the first time at the Commonwealth Games on Sunday.

Madison Wilson, Kiah Melverton, Mollie O’Callaghan and Ariarne Titmus combined to clock 7:39.29 in Birmingham, Great Britain. They took 1.04 seconds off China’s world record from the Tokyo Olympics.

Titmus, the Olympic 200m free and 400m free champion, recorded the fastest 4x200m free relay split in history of 1:52.82, crushing the previous record of 1:53.45 set by Italian Federica Pellegrini at the 2009 World Championships.

In May, Titmus became the first swimmer other than Katie Ledecky to break a Ledecky world record, taking down Ledecky’s best time in the 400m free.

Titmus skipped last month’s worlds, where she would have faced Ledecky, to focus on Commonwealths.

Titmus and Ledecky have not gone head-to-head since Tokyo and may not do so until next summer’s worlds in Fukuoka, Japan.

Earlier Sunday, the Brit Peaty was fourth in the 100m breast, an event where he won every Olympic, world, European and Commonwealth Games title from 2014 through 2021.

Peaty, who owns the 17 best times in history led by the world record of 56.88, clocked 59.86 in Sunday’s final, two and a half months after breaking a bone in his right foot, causing him to miss June’s worlds.

“Lack of training, lack of racing, it is what it is,” the 27-year-old said on the BBC. “I’m a fighter. Sometimes you have got to have these moments to keep on fighting, really. … This is a huge moment for me, really, because it’s a part of my career now where you choose to go on or keep fighting or whatever. I know this is probably my last Commonwealth Games.”

Had Peaty repeated his semifinal time from Saturday, he would have taken gold over countryman James Wilby. Peaty led by .13 at the 50-meter mark in the final and was passed by three men in the last 20 meters.

Two riders were hospitalized and multiple spectators required medical treatment after a crash catapulted an Olympic gold medalist into the crowd during a Commonwealth Games qualifying race on a high-banked track on Sunday.

England’s Matt Walls was treated in the stands for almost 40 minutes after both he and his bike were flung off the track.

The 24-year-old, who won the omnium at the Tokyo Olympics last year, and Isle of Man rider Matt Bostock were taken to hospital after an incident involving several riders who collided on a turn.

Walls was later released from the hospital.

“Following medical treatment in hospital, Matt Walls has been discharged with stitches in his forehead, scrapes and bruises but thankfully no major injuries,” Team England said in a statement. “We send our best wishes to all other riders and spectators involved in the crash and thank the medical teams for their expert care.”

Bostock had a CT scan from which the initial prognosis was positive, his Isle of Man team said.

The morning session of cycling was abandoned and spectators were asked to leave the Lee Valley velodrome as Walls received treatment behind a temporary screen after the crash.

Witnesses said that because of the gradient of the banking on the track, spectators in the front row could not see the crash unfolding, nor Walls coming towards them.

One man received treatment for cuts to his arm and a young girl also required medical assistance.

British Cycling confirmed on social media that Walls and Bostock were the riders taken to hospital.

“We send our best wishes to the riders and spectators involved in the incident and will provide a further update when we can,” British Cycling posted earlier on Twitter.

Officials from several teams sprinted towards the stricken riders after the crash on the final lap of the second qualifying heat. The final is scheduled for Sunday night.

“I think the crashes are getting worse and it’s because the speeds are getting higher, the positions (on the bike) are getting more extreme,” the five-time Olympic champion Laura Kenny said. “Some of the pursuit positions people are getting in, you see people crashing into the back of people.

“At some point the UCI are going to have to put a cap on these positions. Maybe there should be screens because Matt should not have been able to go over the top and into the crowd, that’s pretty damn dangerous.”

“Bill’s wife, Jeannine, and his many friends and family thank you for keeping Bill in your prayers.
Russell led the University of San Francisco to NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956 and won a gold medal at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.
“The gold medal is very, very, very precious to me,” Russell said in an interview for NBC’s Olympic Show in 1999.
I wanted to be a part of that Olympic experience.”Russell‘s gold medal sold for $587,500 as part of an auction of hundreds of his personal memorabilia items last December.","Bill Russell, the NBA great who after winning Olympic gold anchored a Boston Celtics dynasty that won 11 championships in 13 years — the last two as the first Black head coach in any major U.S. sport — and marched for civil rights with Martin Luther King Jr., died Sunday. He was 88.

His family posted the news on social media, saying Russell died with his wife, Jeannine, by his side. The statement did not give the cause of death.

“Bill’s wife, Jeannine, and his many friends and family thank you for keeping Bill in your prayers. Perhaps you’ll relive one or two of the golden moments he gave us, or recall his trademark laugh as he delighted in explaining the real story behind how those moments unfolded,” the family statement said. “And we hope each of us can find a new way to act or speak up with Bill’s uncompromising, dignified and always constructive commitment to principle. That would be one last, and lasting, win for our beloved #6.”

A Hall of Famer, five-time Most Valuable Player and 12-time All-Star, Russell in 1980 was voted the greatest player in the NBA history by basketball writers. He remains the sport’s most prolific winner and an archetype of selflessness who won with defense and rebounding while leaving the scoring to others. Often, that meant Wilt Chamberlain, the only player of the era who was a worthy rival for Russell.

The battles on the court between the centers were fierce — signature showdowns in the NBA. Russell led the University of San Francisco to NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956 and won a gold medal at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.

Russell, then 22, scored a team-leading 14.1 points per game as the U.S. won all eight games in Melbourne by an average of 53.5 points per game.

“The gold medal is very, very, very precious to me,” Russell said in an interview for NBC’s Olympic Show in 1999. “In terms of trophies and things, it’s probably my most prized possession.”

Russell could have skipped those Games, which were held during the NBA season in November and December, but instead delayed the start of his Celtics career.

“Ever since I was a kid, there were social and physical icons that I always heard about. And you think of these things in awe. And when I got to the age where I qualified for the Olympics, I wanted to go,” Russell said, according to the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Museum. “Then, the honor of The Olympics was to compete. Not to win, but to compete. I really wanted that. If I hadn’t made that Olympic basketball team, I was going to participate in the high jump. I was ranked second in the country in the high jump [Editor’s Note: Track and Field News ranked Russell third in the U.S. and seventh in the world in 1956], so either way, I was going to Melbourne. I wanted to be a part of that Olympic experience.”

Russell‘s gold medal sold for $587,500 as part of an auction of hundreds of his personal memorabilia items last December.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement that Russell was “the greatest champion in all of team sports.”

“Bill stood for something much bigger than sports: the values of equality, respect and inclusion that he stamped into the DNA of our league. At the height of his athletic career, Bill advocated vigorously for civil rights and social justice, a legacy he passed down to generations of NBA players who followed in his footsteps,” Silver said. “Through the taunts, threats and unthinkable adversity, Bill rose above it all and remained true to his belief that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity.

In Boston, Russell left a lasting mark as a Black athlete in a city — and country — where race is often a flash point. In 2011, President Barack Obama awarded Russell the Medal of Freedom. Two years later, a statue of Russell was unveiled on Boston’s City Hall Plaza.

“I cherished my friendship with Bill and was thrilled when he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom,” Silver said in his statement. “I often called him basketball’s Babe Ruth for how he transcended time. Bill was the ultimate winner and consummate teammate, and his influence on the NBA will be felt forever. We send our deepest condolences to his wife, Jeannine, his family and his many friends.”

His family said that arrangements for Russell’s memorial service will be announced in the coming days."

PLANCHE DES BELLES FILLES, France — Veteran rider Annemiek van Vleuten won the women’s Tour de France, which returned after a 33-year absence, on Sunday after clinching the eighth and final stage in style.

The 39-year-old van Vleuten won the stage by 30 seconds from Dutch countrywoman Demi Vollering, who also finished the race second overall. Italian rider Silvia Persico was third in the stage, 1 minute, 43 seconds behind the winner.

In the overall standings, Movistar rider van Vleuten was 3:48 clear of Vollering (Team SD Worx) and 6:35 ahead of Polish rider Katarzyna Niewiadoma (Canyon–SRAM) in third spot.

Van Vleuten had just about enough energy to punch the air in delight when crossing the line after the 76-mile mountain stage in the Vosges mountains of eastern France. It featured two category 1 climbs, the second ascent being the stage-ending trek up La Super Planche des Belles Filles, which finished with a daunting gradient of 23%.

She entered the final stage with a lead of 3:14 seconds over Vollering.

On Saturday’s penultimate stage, Van Vleuten rose from eighth overall to take the yellow jersey from Marianne Vos with more superb climbing in the Vosges.

Van Vleuten added this victory to a long list of achievements, including three Giro d’Italia Femminile titles, Olympic gold in time trial and two world championship golds in the same discipline.

Six years ago, her career was under threat after she sustained fractures to her spine and was placed in intensive care after crashing during the women’s Olympic road race at the Brazil Games.

Vos was among the favorites, but the three-time Giro d’Italia champion ended up in 26th place overall.

American Felicia Stancil won the world BMX racing championships, one year after placing fourth in her Olympic debut in Tokyo.

Stancil, 27, got the hole shot and led through the finish, holding off Swiss Zoé Claessens by one hundredth of a second in Nantes, France on Sunday. Merel Smulders of the Netherlands took bronze, just as she did in Tokyo.

“Growing up, world championships meant so much to me,” said Stancil, who won a youth world title in France at age 10. “This is the one thing I’ve always wanted. I’m in shock right now.”

Beth Shriever, the Tokyo Olympic champion from Great Britain, was eliminated in the semifinals.

Stancil won her first senior global championship, 10 years after claiming the first of back-to-back world junior titles.

She did so coming back from dislocating a hip in her first competition of the year — a January crash onto an asphalt berm — an injury that kept her out about four months, according to USA Cycling.

Stancil became the third U.S. woman to win a world title in the event that debuted at the Olympics in 2008, joining Michelle Cairns (1997) and Alise Willoughby (2017, 2019). Willoughby, the 2016 Olympic silver medalist, placed fourth on Sunday.

Swiss Simon Marquart won Sunday’s men’s final that included zero Americans.

Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles are planning to be the first U.S. Olympic women’s gymnastics team members from Tokyo to return to elite competition.

Carey and Chiles plan to compete at the national championships in Tampa in three weeks in hopes of making the five-woman team for this fall’s world championships.

Carey and Chiles, along with Olympic teammates Suni Lee and Grace McCallum, competed last winter and spring in NCAA gymnastics, which is different from elite.

Carey, the Olympic floor exercise champion, and Chiles, part of the silver-medal-winning Olympic team, took part in a USA Gymnastics national team camp two weeks after the NCAA Championships in April. That signaled their intent to return to elite competition.

Carey took part in another camp in early July, along with the Olympic all-around champion Lee, who will not return to elite competition before 2023.

Simone Biles and McCallum left the door open for returns at some point before the 2024 Paris Olympics but have not taken part in any camps since Tokyo. MyKayla Skinner is the lone member of the team to announce a retirement.

Neither Carey nor Chiles entered this Saturday’s U.S. Classic, a tune-up meet for many (but not all) gymnasts with eyes on nationals in Tampa next month.

The last U.S. Olympic women’s artistic gymnastics team members to return for the following year’s nationals were McKayla Maroney and Kyla Ross in 2013.

Leanne Wong earned her biggest all-around gymnastics title in three years, becoming the first woman in history to follow an NCAA season by winning the U.S. Classic, a tune-up for the national championships.

Wong, who won the world all-around silver medal last October after serving as an Olympic alternate, won the U.S. Classic with 54.4 points. She prevailed by .35 of a point over Shilese Jones, the other established elite in the field just outside Salt Lake City.

Full results are here.

Wong, an 18-year-old rising University of Florida sophomore, had the top score on balance beam and tied with Jones for the best single vault score.

Jones led after posting the top score on the uneven bars, her second event, then was passed by Wong after falling twice off the beam. Wong rallied after a bars fall on her second event.

Wong earned her first elite-level all-around title since the 2019 American Cup, her senior debut. She also won three NCAA regular season all-arounds last winter.

Wong and Jones were eighth and 10th in the all-around, respectively, at last year’s Olympic Trials.

Tokyo Olympians Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles are expected to return to elite competition at nationals in Tampa in three weeks, bidding to make the five-woman team for this fall’s world championships in Liverpool, Great Britain. Like Wong, Carey and Chiles began their NCAA careers last winter.

Ledecky, the 10-time Olympic medalist, swam the fastest 400m individual medley of her career for her third victory in as many nights at the U.S. Championships in Irvine, California, on Thursday.

She clocked 4 minutes, 35.77 seconds to prevail by .89 of a second over fellow Olympian Leah Smith. Her time would have earned bronze at the world championships last month.

She moved from outside the top 20 to No. 14 on the U.S. all-time list, passing 1988 Olympic 400m IM champion Janet Evans and 1992 Olympic 400m IM bronze medalist Summer Sanders.

Ledecky, whose previous best was 4:37.93 from 2016, does not swim the 400m IM at major international meets.

“I’ve got a lot of meters of racing that I would like to do at the big meets, so I think adding the 400m IM is a little bit of a stretch,” said Ledecky, who swam an Olympic record 6,200 meters in Tokyo (all freestyle).

It marked her first personal best in any event in an Olympic-size pool since her most recent world record in 2018.

The previous two days in Irvine, Ledecky swam the fourth-fastest 200m free of her career and won her trademark event, the 800m free, by 19.89 seconds. She did not enter any events on the last two days Friday and Saturday.

Later Thursday, Shaine Casas won the 100m butterfly in 50.40 seconds, a time that would have earned silver at last month’s worlds.

Casas, 22, matched Ian Crocker as the sixth-fastest man in history and the third-fastest American behind world record holder Caeleb Dressel and Michael Phelps, who held the world record before Dressel. Phelps’ best in a textile suit was 50.45.

FBI agents in 2015 knew that Nassar was accused of assaulting gymnasts, but they failed to act, leaving him free to continue to target young women and girls for more than a year.
Indianapolis-based USA Gymnastics told local agents in 2015 that three gymnasts said they were assaulted by Nassar, a team doctor.
But the FBI did not open a formal investigation or inform federal or state authorities in Michigan, according to the Justice Department’s inspector general.
Los Angeles agents in 2016 began a sexual tourism investigation against Nassar and interviewed several victims but also didn’t alert Michigan authorities, the inspector general said.","The FBI has reached out to attorneys representing Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles and other women who were sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar to begin settlement talks in the $1 billion claim they brought against the federal government, according to three people familiar with the matter.

The FBI’s general counsel contacted the lawyers for Olympic gold medalists Biles, Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney and dozens of other women on Wednesday. The FBI’s attorneys told the lawyers for the women that they had received the legal claims and the agency was “interested” in a resolution, including discussions about a potential settlement, the people said.

The people could not discuss details of the negotiations publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

John Manly, a lawyer who represents more than 90 victims, declined to comment when contacted earlier Thursday by the AP. The settlement talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

The victims had brought claims against the FBI for failing to stop the sports doctor when the agency first received allegations against him. FBI agents in 2015 knew that Nassar was accused of assaulting gymnasts, but they failed to act, leaving him free to continue to target young women and girls for more than a year. He pleaded guilty in 2017 and is serving decades in prison.

Indianapolis-based USA Gymnastics told local agents in 2015 that three gymnasts said they were assaulted by Nassar, a team doctor. But the FBI did not open a formal investigation or inform federal or state authorities in Michigan, according to the Justice Department’s inspector general. Los Angeles agents in 2016 began a sexual tourism investigation against Nassar and interviewed several victims but also didn’t alert Michigan authorities, the inspector general said.

Nassar wasn’t arrested until the fall of 2016 during an investigation by police at Michigan State University, where he was a doctor. The Michigan attorney general’s office ultimately handled the assault charges against Nassar, while federal prosecutors in Grand Rapids, Michigan, filed a child pornography case.

The Justice Department in May said that it would not pursue criminal charges against former agents who were accused of giving inaccurate or incomplete responses during the inspector general’s investigation. At the time, Justice officials said they were “adhering to its prior decision not to bring federal criminal charges” after a “careful re-review of evidence.”

The opening of settlement talks comes as senior Justice Department officials, including Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite, who runs the department’s criminal division, met with members of Congress about the case on Thursday. In that meeting with several senators, Polite and others presented proposals to change the law to close what officials see as gaps in the statute that had prevented a case from being brought.

But Polite would not give the lawmakers underlying evidence they had requested.

“The FBI again refused to provide underlying information to support their assumption that a jury wouldn’t convict their agents for botching the Nassar investigation, then trying to cover their tracks,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “It’s the latest example of the Department of ‘Just Us’ trying to avoid accountability for its failures.”

FBI Director Christopher Wray has acknowledged major mistakes and said what happened was “inexcusable.” The FBI later fired the supervisory special agent who had interviewed Maroney in 2015. The Justice Department’s inspector general had harshly criticized that agent and his former boss — the agent in charge of the Indianapolis office — for their handling of the allegations.

“I’m especially sorry that there were people at the FBI who had their own chance to stop this monster back in 2015 and failed, and that is inexcusable,” Wray said at a September 2021 congressional hearing. “It never should have happened, and we’re doing everything in our power to make sure it never happens again.”

Leanne Wong, an Olympic alternate who won last October’s world championships all-around silver medal, headlines the U.S. Classic, the primary lead-up meet for the Aug. 18-21 national championships, live on CNBC and streaming on NBCSports.com/live, the NBC Sports app and Peacock.

Women compete Saturday just outside Salt Lake City. The men, including Olympians Brody Malone, Yul Moldauer and Shane Wiskus, plus world pommel horse champion Stephen Nedoroscik, compete Sunday.

Top gymnasts often use the Classic to fine-tune routines ahead of the national championships, after which teams are named for worlds.

None of last year’s Olympic women’s team members are entered in Classic, though Suni Lee, Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles (who all compete collegiately now) said this year that they plan to return to elite, Olympic-level competition at some point before the 2024 Paris Games.

So the spotlight Saturday will be on Wong after fellow 2021 World Championships team members Kayla DiCello and Konnor McClain withdrew earlier this week. Wong, eighth in the all-around at Olympic Trials, was one of four alternates to the six-woman team in Tokyo.

Wong spent most of her Olympic experience in quarantine after roommate Kara Eaker tested positive for COVID-19. Three months later, she earned all-around silver at worlds with a score that would have placed fifth in Tokyo.

Comparing scores between those two meets isn’t quite apples to apples, but consider that Wong finished between the Olympic bronze medalist (Angelina Melnikova) and Olympic fourth-place finisher (Vladislava Urazova). The Olympic gold and silver medalists Lee and Rebeca Andrade didn’t compete in the all-around at worlds.

Wong, 18, then matriculated at the University of Florida, where she shared second in the all-around at the SEC Championships and placed fifth at the NCAA Championships as a freshman.

Later this summer, Wong will be one of the primary contenders for a spot on the five-woman world team, likely along with DiCello and McClain. So may Katelyn Jong, the 2021 U.S. junior all-around champion who moved up to senior this year, and Shilese Jones, who was 10th at Olympic Trials. Both are entered at Classic.

Classic has been a turning or launching point for star gymnasts in the past. In 2013, Simone Biles was pulled from Classic by her coach after two falls, then went on an eight-year all-around win streak surrounding a two-year break from competition from 2016-18. Her comeback meet in 2018? U.S. Classic.

Katie Ledecky didn’t swim the 200m freestyle at last month’s world championships, but her winning time at the U.S. Championships on Wednesday would have won the world title by nearly a half-second.

Ledecky prevailed in 1 minute, 54.50 seconds at nationals in Irvine, California, distancing Erin Gemmell (who lowered her personal best by 1.27 seconds on Wednesday) by 1.64 seconds. Ledecky is undefeated in domestic 200m free races for eight years.

“I’m really happy with that time,” she said on Olympic Channel. “I didn’t feel so great today, so really wasn’t expecting to go that fast.”

Ledecky swam the fourth-best time of her career. Only Australian rival Ariarne Titmus has gone faster this year — a 1:53.31 at her national championships in May. Titmus, who also broke Ledecky’s 400m free world record at Australian nationals, skipped worlds to focus on the Commonwealth Games that start later this week.

Ledecky passed on the 200m free at worlds in part because the 200m free semis were the same night as the 1500m free final.

China’s Yang Junxuan won the world title in 1:54.92. Neither American made the final.

Ledecky hasn’t decided whether she will re-add the 200m free to her program ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Last year, she was fifth in the 200m free, her shortest event, at the Tokyo Olympics, when she also won the 1500m free in the same session. For Paris, the 1500m free and 200m free are separated by two days, which betters the chances that Ledecky puts it back into her program at Olympic Trials.

Ledecky’s last victory in the 200m free at a major international meet was at the 2016 Rio Games.

In Wednesday’s men’s 200m free, 19-year-old Luke Hobson upset Olympian Kieran Smith and won in 1:46.14. Hobson, who was seventh at April’s world championships trials, lowered his personal best by 78 hundredths.

Matt Fallon, a rising Penn sophomore, won the men’s 200m breaststroke in a personal best by one second, 2:07.91, which would have won silver at the world championships. Fallon skipped April’s world team trials to focus on academics.

Mackenzie Looze, daughter of Indiana coach Ray Looze, won the women’s 200m breast in 2:25.35, a personal best by 2.14 seconds.

Isabelle Stadden upset world team members Rhyan White and Claire Curzan in the women’s 200m backstroke, prevailing in 2:07.29. She now ranks sixth in the world this year and fourth among Americans.

Most of the sports are also in the Olympics, but some are not, such as lawn bowls.

Notable athletes entered include Australian swimming stars Ariarne Titmus, Emma McKeon and Kaylee McKeown, two-time Olympic 100m breaststroke champion Adam Peaty of Great Britain (who will represent England) and rising Canadian swimmer Summer McIntosh.

In track and field: Jamaica’s Elaine Thompson-Herah, who swept the 100m and 200m at the last two Olympics, and Shericka Jackson, who last week won the world 200m title in the second-fastest time in history.

Katie Ledecky extended her 12-year win streak in her trademark event by winning the 800m freestyle on the first day of the five-day U.S. Swimming Championships in Irvine, California, on Tuesday.

Ledecky, who owns the 29 fastest times in history in the event, clocked 8 minutes, 12.03 seconds and won by 19.89 seconds over Kensey McMahon.

“I’m happy with that,” said Ledecky, whose time was No. 19 on the all-time list and 1.8 seconds better than the second-best performer in history, Australian rival Ariarne Titmus. “I didn’t really have any expectations coming into this.”

Last month, Ledecky won the 800m free at the world championships to become the first swimmer to win five consecutive titles in an individual event. They go along with her three Olympic golds in the event.

In two years, Ledecky can become the first woman to win four Olympic titles in the same individual event in any sport. The 800m free at the Paris Games is on the 12th anniversary of her first gold medal in the 800m free at age 15 at the London Olympics.

Ledecky is entered in the 100m free, 200m free and 400m individual medley later at nationals.

Also Tuesday, Olympian Natalie Hinds took the women’s 100m free in 53.53 seconds, a personal best by two hundredths at age 28. Hinds, who prevailed by .33 over Gretchen Walsh, now ranks second in the nation this year behind Torri Huske. Hinds was fourth at the world championships trials in April.

Olympian Zach Apple and Matt King tied for the win in the men’s 100m free in 48.44.

Dakota Luther edged Lindsay Looney in the women’s 200m butterfly by .23 of a second. Both went personal-best times that would have qualified them for worlds at April’s trials.

Luther’s 2:07.02, her first personal best since 2019, ranks her seventh in the world this year and third among Americans behind Olympic medalists Hali Flickinger and Regan Smith. Luther skipped April’s world trials due to academic commitments at Georgia and the quick, one-month turnaround from the NCAA Championships, according to Swimswam.com.

Rising Cal sophomore Gabriel Jett won the men’s 200m fly in 1:54.37, ranking him eighth in the world this year and fourth among Americans behind world team members Carson Foster, Luca Urlando and Trenton Julian.

Russian Olympic Committee president Stanislav Pozdnyakov wrote on the Telegram messaging app Tuesday that the country was working to get its athletes access to qualification events and already making plans for the Olympic village in 2024.

Most Olympic sports have suspended athletes from Russia and Belarus since the invasion of Ukraine began in February, following a recommendation from the International Olympic Committee. However, the IOC has not suspended the Russian Olympic Committee, the body which enters Russian teams for the Games.

“In exactly two years, the Olympic Games start in Paris. Despite all of the circumstances, the Russian Olympic Committee is a full-fledged participant in the Olympic movement,” Pozdnyakov wrote. “We are continuing our systematic preparations for the Games and are also carrying out work to ensure qualifying opportunities and equal presence of our athletes in the Olympic village and at the venues, their participation in events during the Games.”

Qualifying for some Olympic sports has already begun, but others won’t start until next year. If sports federations lift bans on Russian athletes competing in international events such as Olympic qualifiers, that could lead to boycotts by Ukraine.

The International Judo Federation has allowed Russia’s team to keep competing as neutral athletes without their flag or anthem. In response, Ukraine refused to participate when Olympic judo qualifying began last month, in particular because it said that 11 of 24 athletes on the Russian team at the event were members of the military.

Zhou, a 21-year-old who could not compete individually at the Olympics due to COVID, has said he will go back to Brown University this summer and did not know if he could balance competitive skating and classes. Zhou took bronze at March’s world championships, which Chen skipped.

Brown, a 27-year-old who was sixth at the Olympics, is on “a mini break from the competitive grind of training” and will reevaluate next steps in the fall, a representative said.

Other U.S. Olympic skaters previously announced retirements — ice dance bronze medalists Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue and world bronze medalist Liu. The pairs’ team of Ashley Cain and Timothy LeDuc said they are stepping away from competitive skating.

The other top Americans who are entered in the Grand Prix Series include world pairs’ champions Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier, three-time world ice dance medalists Madison Chock and Evan Bates, world junior champion Isabeau Levito and 2018 U.S. Olympian Bradie Tennell.

The Paris 2024 Opening Ceremony will be unlike any predecessor.

The framework for the 2024 Games has already been set, from venues to the sports on the program to competition schedules and how athletes and teams qualify. Let’s go through what the Paris Olympics will look like.

What are the 2024 Olympic dates?

The 2024 Paris Olympics open with non-medal competition on July 24, 2024. The Opening Ceremony is July 26. The first medals are awarded July 27 (likely in shooting). The final medals will be decided on Aug. 11 (likely women’s basketball), the day of the Closing Ceremony. Paris is six hours ahead of New York City, so the primetime events will take place in the afternoon in the U.S.

What will the 2024 Olympic Opening Ceremony look like?

The Paris 2024 Opening Ceremony will be unlike any predecessor. Traditionally, the Opening Ceremony is inside a stadium. Paris organizers moved the ceremony outside — along the Seine River with boats carrying athletes along famous landmarks, climaxing with the Eiffel Tower. The plan calls for 160 boats to traverse nearly four miles in front of an estimated half million spectators (mostly in free-to-watch areas), about 10 times the normal Opening Ceremony crowd in a stadium.

What are the 2024 Olympic venues?

Some of Paris’ most iconic locations will host Olympic competition. Roland Garros, the annual site of tennis’ French Open, will host tennis and boxing. Beach volleyball will be in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower at Champ de Mars. The Palace of Versailles will host equestrian and modern pentathlon. Stade de France, which memorably hosted the 1998 men’s soccer World Cup final won by France, will be the home of track and field. Surfing will be in Tahiti, an island in French Polynesia that is about 9,800 miles from Paris.

What new sports are in the 2024 Olympics?

Breaking — don’t call it break dancing — is the lone sport on the 2024 program that will make its Olympic debut. Other sports that debuted in Tokyo return for Paris — skateboarding, sport climbing and surfing. Baseball and softball, which returned for the Tokyo Games after a 13-year break, were not put on the Paris 2024 program.

Who are the athletes to watch ahead of the 2024 Olympics?

With two years to go, the biggest stars leading into the 2024 Paris Games have plenty of time to emerge. So far in 2022, swimmer Katie Ledecky won another four gold medals at the world swimming championships. Caeleb Dressel, who earned five golds in Tokyo, won another two at the world championships before withdrawing on unspecified medical grounds.

Sprinter Sydney McLaughlin broke her 400m hurdles world record two more times this summer. She may add a second individual event — the 400m without hurdles — or switch events entirely. The U.S. won a record 33 medals at the world championships in Eugene, Oregon, with more Tokyo gold medalists adding world titles in the women’s 800m (Athing Mu) and pole vault (Katie Nageotte) and men’s shot put (Ryan Crouser).

In gymnastics, the national championships in August and world championships this fall will provide a better picture. Suni Lee, the Tokyo all-around champion, said she plans to return to elite, Olympic-level competition, but she’s taking a break this summer. Simone Biles has not said if or when she will return to gymnastics competition.

In team sports, the U.S. already qualified for Tokyo in men’s and women’s soccer. The U.S. women will be without the retired Carli Lloyd, but Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan are still part of the national team, which last won gold in 2012. Global stars Stephen Curry (basketball) and Kylian Mbappé (soccer) could make their Olympic debuts in Paris.

107,nbc,sport,Paris 2024 Olympic competition schedule published in detail,"['paris', '1500m', 'olympic', 'womens', '200m', '2024', 'finals', 'hurdles', 'world', 'competition', 'freestyle', 'schedule', 'published', 'free', '400m']","Paris 2024 Olympic organizers published the first public, detailed version of the Games competition schedule.

For Paris, at least for now, the 1500m and 200m finals are two days apart.
In every previous Olympics since the women’s 400m hurdles debuted on the program in 1984, at least one round of the event was on the same day as a round of the flat women’s 400m.
All time, five women and 45 men have competed in both the 400m and 400m hurdles at the same Games, according to Bill Mallon of Olympedia.org.","Paris 2024 Olympic organizers published the first public, detailed version of the Games competition schedule. Opportunities abound for Katie Ledecky, Sydney McLaughlin and some of the world’s top swimmers and track and field athletes.

The full schedule is here. It was first published on the eve of the two-years-out date from the Opening Ceremony, which will be the first of its kind along the Seine River.

As far as competition, this schedule (which is subject to change, consider what’s been published the latest version) was always going to be intriguing.

Start with swimming. It was previously announced that its schedule would extend from eight nights of finals to nine, leading many to wonder if the women’s 200m freestyle and 1500m free finals would be separated. In Tokyo, the first Games to include the women’s 1500m free, the finals were in the same session, creating a busy night for Katie Ledecky. She placed fifth in the 200m free (which she won in 2016) and won the 1500m.

For Paris, at least for now, the 1500m and 200m finals are two days apart. Ledecky, who dropped the 200m free from her world championships slate last month in part because it overlapped with the 1500m at that meet, said before worlds that she was undecided about the 200m free for 2024.

“It definitely would be more on the table if the schedule does open up a little bit more and creates a little more rest in there,” she said in June before taking gold in all four of her events at worlds.

If Ledecky qualifies for the 2024 Games in the same events as she did in Tokyo — 200m, 400m, 800m and 1500m frees, plus the 4x200m free relay — she could swim eight consecutive days in Paris, but never have to race twice in the same session.

July 27: 400m freestyle heat and final

July 28: 200m freestyle heat and semifinal

July 29: 200m freestyle final

July 30: 1500m freestyle heat

July 31: 1500m freestyle final

Aug. 1: 4x200m freestyle relay final

Aug. 2: 800m freestyle heat

Aug. 3: 800m freestyle final (12th anniversary of Ledecky’s first Olympic title in 800m free in London)

Her slate would culminate with the 800m free final on Saturday, Aug. 3, which could be the first of consecutive crown jewel days of the Games.

In the first Olympics with swimming, track and field and gymnastics finals on both days of the middle weekend, that Saturday’s finals also include the men’s 100m butterfly (Caeleb Dressel‘s trademark event), men’s shot put (where Ryan Crouser is the two-time reigning Olympic champion, world champion and world record holder), women’s 100m (possibly including Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Elaine Thompson-Herah going for a third gold in the event) the end of the decathlon (where France’s biggest track and field star, Kevin Mayer, is reigning world champion and world record holder) and the first night of apparatus finals in gymnastics, which could include the return to action of the all-around gold medalists from earlier in the week.

An American won the last five Olympic women’s all-around titles. What’s more, 2016 champ Simone Biles has teased the idea of making a comeback as a specialist rather than an all-arounder, so if she returns, her individual target would be those apparatus finals that start Aug. 3.

In track and field, Sydney McLaughlin‘s coming decision on what event(s) she will focus on could be impacted by the 2024 Olympic schedule. McLaughlin, after shattering her 400m hurdles world record to win her first world title last week, said anything is possible moving forward, including shifting to the flat 400m, which her coach has said is in her future.

McLaughlin showed what was possible in the closing 4x400m relay at worlds on Sunday by clocking 47.91 seconds on her leg, the second-fastest split in the last 33 years, according to track statisticians.

In every previous Olympics since the women’s 400m hurdles debuted on the program in 1984, at least one round of the event was on the same day as a round of the flat women’s 400m.

In Paris, that will not be the case — in the traditional sense. A woman who advances from first round to semifinals to final of each event would have this schedule:

Aug. 4: 400m hurdles first round

Aug. 5: 400m first round

Aug. 6: 400m hurdles semifinal

Aug. 7: 400m semifinal

Aug. 8: 400m hurdles final

Aug. 9: 400m final

Aug. 10: 4x400m relay final

A caveat is that the Paris Games will introduce repechage rounds, an extra, second-chance round for athletes who do not advance from the first round to the semifinals. That’s something that McLaughlin and the rest of the world’s top athletes shouldn’t have to worry about.

All time, five women and 45 men have competed in both the 400m and 400m hurdles at the same Games, according to Bill Mallon of Olympedia.org. None of the women earned a medal in either event. American Harry Hillman won both events at the 1904 St. Louis Games, where the fields were small and largely American.

Katie Ledecky and Bobby Finke headline the U.S. Swimming Championships in Irvine, California, this week, live on Olympic Channel: Home of Team USA and streaming on Peacock, NBCSports.com/live and the NBC Sports app.

A month after the world championships concluded in Budapest, swimmers are vying for national championships and a springboard into the year before the 2024 Paris Olympics.

In a first, every year in this Olympic cycle includes a world championships. Next summer, they’ll be in Fukuoka, Japan.

Ledecky, who won four golds in four events in Budapest, is entered in Irvine in her trademark event, the 800m freestyle, as well as events she doesn’t swim at major international meets — the 100m free and 400m individual medley.

Her most anticipated race may be the 200m free, which she did not contest at worlds but could add back to her program ahead of Paris.

Others entered include world championships team members Claire Curzan, Leah Smith, Michael Andrew and Shaine Casas.

Paris 2024 Olympic organizers unveiled the Games’ slogan — “Games Wide Open” — on the eve of the two-years-out date from the Opening Ceremony.

“It‘a simple, but for us it’s effective,” Paris 2024 President Tony Estanguet said, noting the slogan is a continuation of the previous bid slogan, “Made for Sharing.” “This idea of sharing with people the energy of the Games is very important.”

That will manifest with events such as the previously announced mass participation marathon that will be held in relation to the Games on the Olympic marathon route.

The Opening Ceremony will be like none before — held outside a stadium along the Seine River with boats carrying athletes along famous landmarks, climaxing with the Eiffel Tower.

The Games — with non-medal competition starting July 24, 2024 — feature 329 medal events, 10 fewer than the record 339 in Tokyo. Paris hosts for a record-tying third time, 100 years after its last time hosting.

Breaking is the lone sport on the Paris program that will make its Olympic debut, though it was held at the last Youth Summer Olympics in 2018.

Competition venues include Roland Garros for tennis and boxing, Champ de Mars near the Eiffel Tower for beach volleyball, the Palace of Versailles for equestrian and modern pentathlon and Tahiti for surfing.

Estanguet said that no discussions have been had yet on the cauldron setup and who may be a final torchbearer. He also said organizers will look at ways for athletes who are not staying in the Paris area, such as the surfers, to celebrate the Opening Ceremony.

Among the upcoming milestones for Paris 2024 is the mascot reveal.

“We tried to add a French touch,” Estanguet said.

Nigerian Tobi Amusan broke the women’s 100m hurdles world record in the semifinals at the world track and field championships in Eugene, Oregon. She went even faster to win the final nearly two hours later.

Amusan, who was fourth at the Tokyo Olympics and at the last worlds in 2019, clocked 12.12 seconds in Sunday’s semifinals at Hayward Field.

In the final, she won in 12.06, but with too much tailwind for record purposes. Jamaican Britany Anderson took silver, followed by Olympic gold medalist Jasmine Camacho-Quinn of Puerto Rico.

Amusan took eight hundredths off American Keni Harrison‘s world record of 12.20 from 2016. It’s the largest time drop for a world record in the event in 42 years.

“At first I was like, where the wind reading at?” Amusan said (the wind was +.9 meters/second, well below the limit of two meters/second). “But then I wasn’t really bothered because the goal is to cross the line first.”

Amusan’s previous personal best was 12.40, set in the first round at worlds on Saturday.

Amusan became a hurdler by chance, according to World Athletics. At age 13 or 14, she went to a meet intending to compete in the flat sprints and long jump. But by the time she arrived, the only event left was a hurdles race. She won that race, and the rest — especially Sunday night — is now history.

Nigerian Tobi Amusan (100m hurdles) and Swede Mondo Duplantis (pole vault) also broke world records Sunday.

Mu and the U.S. men’s and women’s 4x400m relays won on the last day of the 10-day meet in Eugene, Oregon, the first outdoor worlds to be held in the U.S.

In all, the U.S. earned five medals on Sunday to finish with 33, breaking the record of 31 medals won by East Germany in 1987. Its 13 gold medals are one shy of the record that the U.S. holds from 2005, 2007 and 2019.

Notably, the retiring Allyson Felix earned a records-extending 20th career world championships medal and 14th gold for her participation in Saturday’s preliminary heats of the women’s 4x400m.

Sydney McLaughlin anchored the final quartet with a split of 47.91 seconds, making her the seventh-fastest relay performer in history and second-fastest in the last 33 years behind Felix. It could be a sign of things to come as McLaughlin, who smashed her world record in the 400m hurdles on Friday, may move full-time to the flat 400m.

Mu became the first American woman to win a world 800m title, a year after becoming the second American woman to win an Olympic 800m title. She barely held off surging Brit Keely Hodgkinson, the Olympic silver medalist, to her inside over the last 100 meters. Mu is undefeated in outdoor 800m races dating to 2019. On Her Turf has more on the women’s 800m here.

“Today was kind of a rough day for me,” said Mu, who in Tokyo won by a more comfortable .67 of a second. “I just physically wasn’t where I would like to be. I just didn’t feel my best.”

Mu, at 20, became the youngest woman to own Olympic and world titles in an individual track and field event in history. The only younger man to do it was Kirani James of Grenada in the 400m in 2011 and 2012.

TRACK WORLDS: Results

Also Sunday, Amusan ran the two fastest women’s 100m hurdles times in history, though only one counted for a world record. More on Amusan here. Duplantis capped the meet by breaking his own pole vault world record, clearing 6.21 meters (20 feet, 4 inches).

“I did not touch it [the bar], so that gives you confidence that you can go higher,” said Duplantis, one of only two men to pole vault higher than 20 feet outdoors (Sergey Bubka).

Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen added a world 5000m title to his Olympic 1500m crown, taking the lead with 900 meters left and pulling away in the final 200. American Grant Fisher was in third coming around the last curve, stumbled — could have been clipped by another runner — and dropped to sixth.

Ingebrigtsen wants to run the 1500m and 5000m at the Olympics, but ran solely the 1500m in Tokyo because the events overlapped. The 2024 Olympic track and field schedule has not been published, though Ingebrigtsen said before worlds that he petitioned for the events to be separated and that it was rejected.

Kenya finished worlds without a gold medal in any of the men’s and women’s 5000m, 10,000m, marathons and 3000m steeplechases for the first time since the first worlds in 1983.

World record holder Kevin Mayer of France earned his second world title in the decathlon, a day after Olympic gold medalist Damian Warner of Canada pulled up with a leg injury in the 400m. Mayer earned silver medals at the last two Olympics and has a home Games in two years in Paris.

Zach Ziemek took bronze to become the first American medalist in the decathlon since Ashton Eaton retired after his second Olympic title in 2016.

German Malaika Mihambo followed her Olympic gold by repeating as world champion in the long jump, edging Olympic bronze medalist Ese Brume of Nigeria by 10 centimeters.

The track and field season continues with the resumption of the Diamond League circuit with a meet in Poland on Aug. 6, with early commits including Duplantis and world 100m champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce of Jamaica.

Vingegaard, whose only Grand Tour experience was a 46th-place finish in the previous year’s Vuelta a España, ascended to team leader.

This time, Vingegaard had already gapped Pogacar in the Alps and was about to pad his lead in the Pyrenees.","Like any Tour de France champion, Jonas Vingegaard‘s path to victory began well before the three-week, 2,000-mile route that, this year, spanned four different countries.

Vingegaard celebrated his first Tour title on Sunday, riding into Paris to claim a trophy he wrapped up days earlier with dominance through the mountains and help from cycling’s dominant team (which also won its much more long-awaited first Tour title).

He began Sunday’s 21st and final, non-combative stage with a lead of 3 minutes, 34 seconds over Slovenian Tadej Pogacar, whose two-year reign as champion ends. Brit Geraint Thomas, the 2018 Tour winner, takes third. It is the first time since 1989 that all three men standing on the podium know what it’s like to win a Tour.

Belgian sprinter Jasper Philipsen won the last stage. Vingegaard, Pogacar and Thomas finished with the peloton in the same time.

“Now nothing can go wrong anymore,” Vingegaard, who refused to acknowledge his assured victory until after the last stage, said while holding 2-year-old daughter Frida in Paris. “Nobody can take this away from me.”

In the first Tour to start in Denmark, a 25-year-old from North Jutland became the second Dane to finish it on the top step on the Champs-Élysées backdropped by the Arc de Triomphe. (The other, Bjarne Riis in 1996, after retiring a decade later, admitted to doping throughout the 1990s and during that Tour.)

Vingegaard is familiar with that picturesque setting in Paris. Last year, he stood on the runner-up step of that podium, a distant five minutes, 20 seconds behind Pogacar, who then at 22 years old looked like he had no peers. Certainly not Vingegaard, who was not supposed to be on the podium.

TOUR DE FRANCE: Final Standings

Many will start his narrative a handful of years ago. They will share the footage of Vingegaard working in a fish-packing facility to fund his cycling. That story, too rich to ignore, came before he signed with the Jumbo-Visma pro team in 2019.

But if you ask the man himself, he will say that he began believing a day like this was possible during his Tour debut last year. Jumbo-Visma star Primoz Roglic, who squandered the 2020 Tour title in the final time trial, crashed badly in the third stage and withdrew before the ninth in 2021.

Vingegaard, whose only Grand Tour experience was a 46th-place finish in the previous year’s Vuelta a España, ascended to team leader. He was in fifth place at the time.

“We can’t hide you behind Primoz anymore,” he was told.

Three days later, Vingegaard had the day of his young career, dropping Pogacar on Mont Ventoux, the bald “Beast of Provence” that is one of the Tour’s iconic climbs. Pogacar caught back up with help, and his grip on the Tour at the time wasn’t threatened, but it was a sign of what Vingegaard was capable of.

This year, the Dane returned for his second Tour as a co-leader with Roglic. Again, Roglic crashed early and abandoned before stage 15. This time, Vingegaard had already gapped Pogacar in the Alps and was about to pad his lead in the Pyrenees.

Jumbo-Visma, which took over from Ineos Grenadiers as the world’s top team two years ago, was down not only Roglic but also Dutchman Steven Kruijswijk, who was third in the 2019 Tour.

The depth of the outfit shone. Vingegaard was paced on climbs by Wout van Aert, the top sprinter this year, and American Sepp Kuss. In post-stage interviews, he first dedicated his riding to his girlfriend and daughter — “my two girls” — then thanked the team.

The Dutch team formerly sponsored by Rabobank earned its first Tour top-five in 1998 with Dutchman Michael Boogerd (who later admitted to being one of the many 1990s riders who doped). It then cycled through Grand Tour general classification contenders, from Russian Denis Menchov (who won the Giro d’Italia and the Vuelta and had a Tour runner-up stripped due to biological passport violations) to Dane Michael Rasmussen (and his infamous removal while leading the 2007 Tour) to Dutchmen like Robert Gesink and Kruijswijk.

Then came Roglic, the former junior champion ski jumper who was the face of the team as it overtook Ineos. Vingegaard was in the background until last July. This July, he stands alone in the Paris gloaming, no longer a hidden man.

“[Starting] Friday, I’ll be on the couch for one week,” said Vingegaard, who first travels to Denmark for festivities. “I want to celebrate, relax, but then I also want more.”

On Her Turf has more on the women’s 5000m here.","The U.S. women’s 4x100m pulled off the upset. The U.S. men’s 4x100m got upset.

The penultimate day of the world track and field championships produced surprises in the final two races on Saturday night’s program.

Melissa Jefferson, Abby Steiner, Jenna Prandini and TeeTee Terry stunned a Jamaican women’s quartet that included Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah, who swept the individual 100m medals. The U.S. prevailed by four hundredths in 41.14 seconds.

Jefferson had the best split of the leadoff runners, then Steiner outsplit Thompson-Herah by .24, enough for Prandini and Terry to hold off Fraser-Pryce and Jackson’s charge.

“[If] there’s no chemistry, there’s no trust to be able to move the baton through the exchanges, then you aren’t really going to produce what you think you can produce just because you have the three or four fastest women,” Terry said. “Our chemistry was so good that we didn’t even really have to do much when we warmed up.”

Twenty minutes later, Christian Coleman, Noah Lyles, Elijah Hall and Marvin Bracy-Williams delivered silver rather than the expected gold. Canada, which won the men’s 4x100m at the last global championship held in the U.S. at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, edged the Americans by seven hundredths with Andre De Grasse anchoring.

The U.S. had subpar handoffs from Coleman to Lyles and even more so from Hall to Bracy-Williams on anchor.

The U.S. was without Fred Kerley, who won the individual 100m last Saturday as part of an American medals sweep, then suffered a quad injury in the 200m semifinals.

The U.S. is the greatest sprint nation in history, yet has swept the 4x100m golds at just one global championship (Olympics or worlds) in the last 29 years (22 meets). It is a testament that relays are not won purely by raw speed.

“A lot of people see that [silver] as a defeat, but to be honest with the struggles we’ve been having over the years, it’s just nice to get the stick around, run a fast time,” said Lyles, who was on the 2019 4x100m that earned the U.S. men’s lone gold since 2007.

Worlds finish Sunday with nine finals, including the women’s 800m (Athing Mu) and 100m hurdles (Keni Harrison), men’s pole vault (Mondo Duplantis) and decathlon finale and 4x400m relays.

TRACK WORLDS: Broadcast Schedule | Results | U.S. Roster | Key Events

Earlier Saturday, Allyson Felix made a surprise return to help the U.S. women’s 4x400m relay qualify for Sunday’s final. Felix, who thought last week’s mixed-gender 4x400m would be her last major race before retirement, was called in from Los Angeles (while eating hot wings and drinking a root beer float) to return to Eugene for the women’s 4x400m heats.

Felix, who was sixth at nationals in the individual 400m, had the fastest split of the four American women in the heat, but said she does not expect to be asked to be part of the final quartet. Expect 400m hurdles gold and bronze medalists Sydney McLaughlin and Dalilah Muhammad to be subbed in. Felix would still be in line for a record-extending 20th career world championships medal as prelim runners also receive medals.

Gudaf Tsegay gave Ethiopia a sweep of the women’s 5000m, 10,000m and marathon at worlds, taking the 5000m five days after earning silver in the 1500m and then being subbed into the nation’s 5000m lineup. She moved past Olympic gold medalist Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands coming around the final curve. Hassan faded to sixth, one spot behind world record holder Letesenbet Gidey of Ethiopia. On Her Turf has more on the women’s 5000m here.

Kenyan Emmanuel Korir followed his Tokyo Olympic gold with a world title in the 800m Korir overtook Canadian Marco Arop on the final straight. Algerian Djamel Sedjati also passed Arop for silver. No Americans made the final.

Like Korir, triple jumper Pedro Pablo Pichardo of Portugal added a world title to his Olympic gold. No Americans earned a medal in the event for the first time since 2009.

Grenada javelin thrower Anderson Peters, who got his start throwing rocks at mango trees as a kid, repeated as world champion.

Olympic decathlon champion Damian Warner of Canada pulled up with a left leg injury in the 400m, the fifth and final event of the first of two days of the competition. Warner was in the overall lead. Ayden Owens-Delerme of Puerto Rico, the NCAA champion from Michigan, took over the lead going into the last five events Sunday.

Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark will ride into Paris on Sunday as a first-time Tour de France champion after placing second in Saturday’s time trial.

“It’s hard for me to put words on it,” he said. “It’s both a relief, and I’m just so happy and proud.”

Vingegaard began the 25-mile time trial with the Tour title all but wrapped up thanks to a 3-minute, 21-second lead gained through the Alps and Pyrenees the previous two weeks.

He then posted the second-fastest time of the 139 riders in what is called “the race of truth,” trailing Jumbo-Visma teammate Wout van Aert by 19 seconds after nearly 48 minutes on the bike.

Vingegaard extended his advantage in the overall standings to 3:34 over Slovenian Tadej Pogacar, the two-time reigning Tour champion, after more than 76 hours on the bike over the last three weeks.

Geraint Thomas, the 2018 Tour winner, remained in third place overall to round out what will be the final podium on the Champs-Elysees on Sunday.

Vingegaard will become the second Dane to win the Tour after Bjarne Riis, who prevailed in 1996 and, a decade later after retiring, said he used banned performance-enhancing drugs throughout the 1990s, including during that Tour.

Vingegaard, 25, will become the first man to finish second and first in his first two Tours since German Jan Ullrich in 1996 and 1997.

Vingegaard was a revelation of the 2021 Tour, taking a distant runner-up to Pogacar in his second-ever Grand Tour. He started believing he could one day win a Tour when he dropped Pogacar on Mont Ventoux, one of the Tour’s iconic climbs.

“Since last year I always believed I could do it, and now it happened,” he said.

This year, the man who previously worked in a fish factory entered the Tour as a co-leader of Jumbo-Visma with Slovenian Primoz Roglic. But Roglic struggled early on and eventually withdrew after separating a shoulder (and popping it back in) in the first week.

Vingegaard’s victory is also a breakthrough first Tour title for the Dutch Jumbo-Visma outfit, which for years has been considered the best team in stage racing yet was thwarted by Pogacar in 2020 and 2021.

In 2020, Roglic squandered a 57-second lead on Pogacar going into the final time trial.

“What happened two years ago, we all were thinking about it,” Vingegaard said. “We didn’t want it to happen again.”

McLaughlin also matched Edwin Moses‘ feat of breaking the 400m hurdles world record four times over a career, though Moses needed seven years to do it.
“I imagined it, but it was better than I imagined.”American Olympic gold medalist Athing Mu led the qualifiers into Sunday’s 800m final.","Sydney McLaughlin broke the 400m hurdles world record for the fourth time in the last 13 months, clocking 50.68 seconds to complete her trophy case with her first world championships gold medal in the event.

She shattered her previous record from a month ago of 51.14.

“We thought we’d be able to go a little bit faster [than 50.68],” she told Lewis Johnson of NBC Sports. “But we’re super grateful with that time. Anything under 51 was a win for us.”

Since June 2021, she brought the world record down from 52.16 to 50.68. She is nine tenths of a second faster than the second-fastest woman in history, countrywoman Dalilah Muhammad, who took bronze behind Dutchwoman Femke Bol in Eugene, Oregon, on Friday.

McLaughlin, 22, became the second-youngest track and field athlete in history to own the three biggest accolades in an individual event — Olympic gold, world title and world record. Only Ethiopian distance runner Kenenisa Bekele held all three at a younger age.

McLaughlin supplanted Usain Bolt as the second-youngest person to complete the triple by a matter of days.

McLaughlin also matched Edwin Moses‘ feat of breaking the 400m hurdles world record four times over a career, though Moses needed seven years to do it.

McLaughlin has been a generational talent in the event at least since becoming, at 17 in 2016, the youngest U.S. Olympic track and field competitor since 1972.

She was eliminated in the semifinals in Rio, running 56.22 and saying afterward, “If I want to earn mine, I have to work a little bit harder.” She has since become a legend.

What’s next for McLaughlin? Likely a spot in Sunday’s women’s 4x400m relay final should the U.S. qualify and should she want to race one more time.

Then, perhaps, a switch to the flat 400m. McLaughlin’s legendary coach, Bob Kersee, said that she is going to eventually turn to that event and chase that (37-year-old) world record, perhaps after this season, NBC Sports analyst Ato Boldon said last month.

“Me and Bobby are going to go back after the season, decide if this [400m hurdles] is still an event I even want to do, or if we’re going to find something else because I think we’ve accomplished so much in it,” McLaughlin said. “It could be [the flat 400m]. Anything is possible. Bobby will let me know. I follow what he says.”

Worlds continue Saturday with six finals, including the 4x100m relays.

Earlier Friday, Michael Norman became the first American man to win a global title in the 400m since LaShawn Merritt in 2013. Norman, the world’s fastest 400m runner in the last Olympic cycle yet fifth in Tokyo, earned his first individual global medal. It’s the first time since 2007 that the U.S. men sweep the 100m, 200m and 400m golds at an Olympics or worlds.

“A lot of relief right now,” Norman said. “It’s been an extremely long three years, disappointment and life lesson in Doha [2019 World Championships], COVID and then a slap in the face in Tokyo.”

Shaunae Miller-Uibo of the Bahamas added her first world title to her two Olympic gold medals in the 400m, clocking 49.11 to distance Olympic silver medalist Marileidy Paulino of the Dominican Republic by .49. No Americans made the final.

Kara Winger extended a historic meet for U.S. women’s throwers, becoming the first American to win a world championships medal in the women’s javelin. Winger, a 36-year-old who plans to retire after this season, moved from fifth to second on her sixth and final throw. On Her Turf has more on the women’s javelin here.

“This was more than I ever could have imagined,” said Winger, who came back from ACL tear surgeries in 2012 and 2020 and 2015 left shoulder surgery. “I imagined it, but it was better than I imagined.”

American Olympic gold medalist Athing Mu led the qualifiers into Sunday’s 800m final. All of her top challengers also advanced out of the semifinals, including Olympic silver medalist Keely Hodgkinson of Great Britain and two Americans: Olympic bronze medalist Raevyn Rogers and two-time world bronze medalist Ajeé Wilson.

Both the U.S. men’s and women’s 4x100m relays advanced to Saturday’s finals. The men are favorites, even without injured 100m gold medalist Fred Kerley. The women are underdogs to Jamaica, which swept the 100m medals.

Well, well, well.

The most overlooked story of the 2022 offseason is overlooked no longer.

On Tuesday, the NFL suspended Dolphins owner Stephen Ross for the first six weeks of the 2022 season for tampering with former Saints coach Sean Payton and Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady.

Mary Jo White, who was hired to investigate the allegation that Ross and the Dolphins tried to tank in 2019 in order to improve 2020 draft position, ended up investigating whether and to what extent Ross and the Dolphins tampered with Payton and Brady. She found that they did.

“The Dolphins had impermissible communications with quarterback Tom Brady in 2019-20, while he was under contract to the New England Patriots,” the league said in a statement. “Those communications began as early as August 2019 and continued throughout the 2019 season and postseason. These numerous and detailed discussions were conducted by Mr. Beal, who in turn kept Mr. Ross and other Dolphins executives informed of his discussions with Mr. Brady.

“The Dolphins again had impermissible communications with both Mr. Brady and his agent during and after the 2021 season, while he was under contract to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Those discussions began no later than early December 2021 and focused on Mr. Brady becoming a limited partner in the Dolphins and possibly serving as a football executive, although at times they also included the possibility of his playing for the Dolphins. Both Messrs. Ross and Beal were active participants in these discussions.

“In January 2022, the Dolphins had impermissible communications with Don Yee, the agent for New Orleans Saints’ head coach Sean Payton, about having Mr. Payton serve as Miami’s head coach. Miami did not seek consent from New Orleans to have these discussions, which occurred before Coach Payton announced his decision to retire as head coach of the Saints. Following that announcement, Miami requested permission to speak to Coach Payton for the first time, which New Orleans declined to grant.”

“The investigators found tampering violations of unprecedented scope and severity,” Commissioner Goodell said in a statement. “I know of no prior instance of a team violating the prohibition on tampering with both a head coach and star player, to the potential detriment of multiple other clubs, over a period of several years. Similarly, I know of no prior instance in which ownership was so directly involved in the violations.”

The NFL stripped Miami of the team’s first-run pick in 2023, and its third-round selection in 2024. Ross is barred from the team’s facility through October 17, and he cannot represent the club at any team or league event. He is barred from any league meetings before March 2023, and he has been fined $1.5 million.

Beal, the vice chairman and limited partner of the Dolphins, has been barred from all league meetings through the end of the year and fined $500,000.

We asked the league whether Ross and the Dolphins have any appeal rights in this content. League spokesman Brian McCarthy tells PFT that it is “effective immediately.”"

Under the six-game suspension imposed by disciplinary officer Sue L. Robinson on Monday, Watson stood to lose $345,000 from the $230 million deal he signed with the Browns.

The NFL’s decision to appeal could prompt the sides to resume settlement talks, which previously went nowhere. The NFLPA, working with Watson’s camp, wasn’t willing to accept more than 6-8 games. The league would agree to 12 games plus a fine in the range of $8 million.

Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady made a bit of a stir by missing practice on Friday for personal reasons. The stir can officially end. Brady is back.

Joey Knight of the Tampa Bay Times has posted video evidence of Brady at practice.

Brady had missed two practices, and he hadn’t been on the field since news emerged of the fact that the Dolphins tampered with him extensively, from 2019 through 2022. Brady has yet to conduct a press conference since the NFL announced its findings, so he hasn’t been asked about the issue.

Wild guess — the questions he gets from the media covering the Bucs will be far different in tone and content than the questions he’d currently endure from the Boston media.

Although Brady did nothing wrong (per the rules) by being tampered with, the timing and extent of the discussions go far beyond simply taking a phone call and politely declining to pursue the possibility. He and Dolphins vice chair Bruce Beal, a close friend, had numerous communications about the possibility of Brady playing for the Dolphins while Brady was playing for the Patriots and Buccaneers.

Brady has every right to do that. But it’s hard to fully embrace the notion that Tom is all about team when Tom is really all about Tom. He wants to pick his next place to play with the primary goal in mind of whether that organization will help him fulfill his goal of winning not just another Super Bowl but, ideally, all of them.

Once he’s on a team, he’s all about team. Because he needs to be all about team in order to get the thing that Tom is all about.

On one hand, tampering happens all the time in the NFL. On the other hand, quarterback Tom Brady has allowed himself to be tampered with brazenly and blatantly for four straight years.

As determined by the NFL, the Dolphins tampered with Brady in 2019. They tampered with Brady in 2020. They tampered with Brady in 2021. They tampered with Brady in 2022.

The ultimate source and cause of the tampering is Dolphins co-owner Bruce Beal. We flagged that relationship long ago. Consider this article from January 2020, regarding Brady possibly signing with the Dolphins: “Then there’s the Bruce Beal factor. The partner of Dolphins owner Stephen Ross has an option to buy the team whenever Ross decides to sell it. Some believe Ross may decide to sell much sooner than later, with Beal buying the team and selling a sliver of it to Brady.”

Beal and Brady are close friends. Beal was the primary conduit when the Dolphins tampered with Brady while he played for the Patriots.

And Beal could be the reason it all blew up. As one league source told PFT, Beal had been telling his friends in New York City for more than a year about his efforts to bring Brady to the Dolphins. At a time when plenty of teams aren’t discreet about tampering, Beal most definitely was not.

For Brady, there’s no violation of the rules. No player can be disciplined for being tampered with. But he can be criticized by fans and media for it.

Brady, while playing for the Patriots, was talking to the Dolphins about playing for them. Then, while playing for the Buccaneers, he was at it again.

Again, he’s not the first nor the last. It would be naive to assume, for example, that the Broncos didn’t engage in technically impermissible communications with Russell Wilson‘s agent before being authorized to speak to Wilson, and the Packers complained in 2021 (probably accurately) that teams were tampering with Aaron Rodgers.

Yes, tampering happens all the time. For Brady specifically, it literally has happened all the time.

And it wasn’t just the Dolphins who tampered with him. The Buccaneers did in 2020; coach Bruce Arians admitted interest in Brady at the Scouting Combine, while he was still under contract with the Patriots. Surely, other teams talked to him and to agent Don Yee at that same time.

It’s one thing to do it after a season has ended. Being tampered with has a different feel when it happens while football season is happening.

For some Buccaneers fans, the timing may not matter. They may feel betrayed and/or lied to by Brady, who (as we suggested at the time) wasn’t retiring from football but retiring from the Buccaneers. When his path to Miami imploded due to the Brian Flores lawsuit, Brady ultimately decided to return to the Bucs, whose head coach coincidentally (eye roll) decided to step down after Brady came back.

Along the way, there was at least circumstantial evidence of Brady possibly going to the 49ers for a year, from coach Kyle Shanahan skipping the Scouting Combine to Brady visiting his parents that week in San Mateo to the Niners hiring that week former Brady college teammate Brian Griese as the team’s new quarterbacks coach. (Brady’s first choice in 2020, as Chris Simms has said, was the 49ers. They opted to stick with Jimmy Garoppolo.)

The broader point is this. Fans wants players to put team before all else. Plenty of players don’t and won’t. For Brady, team is often a means to an end. And the end is the pursuit of his favorite Super Bowl ring.

The departure of longtime Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels this offseason led head coach Bill Belichick to change up the team’s offensive system, with Matt Patricia — formerly a defensive coach — now calling the offensive plays. So far in training camp, it does not appear to be working.

Reporters on the scene at Patriots camp have described an ugly collection of mistakes and miscommunications, and Monday’s practice appeared to be the worst yet.

As Mark Daniels of the Providence Journal described it, “We’ve seen the offense look routinely disjointed as a new offensive coaching staff tries to install a new offense.”

Words like “disorganization” and “confusion” have been used by reporters at Patriots camp to describe how the Patriots’ offensive players appear to be picking up the new offense.

In Monday’s practice, the Patriots’ first four offensive snaps consisted of a false start by offensive tackle Trent Brown, followed by running back Damien Harris getting stuffed at the line of scrimmage, followed by an incompletion on a miscommunication between Mac Jones and Nelson Agholor, followed by a sack.

Sacks, of course, don’t truly happen in training camp because quarterbacks are off limits, but coaches blow the play dead when a defensive player would have sacked the quarterback, and those plays have been commonplace in Patriots camp. Jones is rarely having much time to throw as the Patriots’ defensive line dominates the offensive line.

There’s still more than a month before the start of the season, and perhaps all the kinks will get worked out by then. But the early reports are that the Patriots’ revamped offense is in rough shape."

So that’s the best explanation; the Dolphins aren’t alone in tampering.","Getty Images

On Tuesday, the NFL announced that the Dolphins had been engaged in a blatant, multi-year tampering effort that targeted a Super Bowl-winning coach and the greatest player of all time, and that victimized three different NFL franchises (Patriots, Buccaneers, Saints). The punishment doesn’t seem to come close to fitting the crime.

“The investigators found tampering violations of unprecedented scope and severity,” Commissioner Roger Goodell said in announcing the discipline. “I know of no prior instance of a team violating the prohibition on tampering with both a head coach and star player, to the potential detriment of multiple other clubs, over a period of several years. Similarly, I know of no prior instance in which ownership was so directly involved in the violations.”

So why did the Dolphins lose only a first-round pick and a third-round pick for it? Sure, owner Stephen Ross is required to stay in New York (where he spends most of his time anyway) through October 23 and pay $1.5 million. Yes, co-owner Bruce Beal also was fined $500,000 and can’t attend league meetings through the end of the year (big deal). For what they actually did, and given the slim chance that they were going to even be caught, it arguably was worth it.

The extent of the prohibited conversations shows just how nonchalantly tampering happens. They talked to Brady in 2019 and 2020, when he was under contract with the Patriots. They talked to Brady and his agent, Don Yee, during and after the 2021 season, while Brady was playing for the Buccaneers. They talked to Yee, who also represents Sean Payton, about hiring Payton before he resigned from the Saints.

(Here’s something to ponder: Would Payton have resigned from the Saints if he didn’t think he would be coaching the Dolphins in 2022?)

It’s unclear how the league set the penalties. Maybe the truth is that it’s unprecedented only insofar as the Dolphins were caught, thanks to the concerns raised by former Dolphins coach Brian Flores and a tanking investigation that found plenty of evidence of attempted tanking but that (thanks to Flores) never became actual tanking.

Other tampering has occurred. As explained in Playmakers, the Cowboys had put everything in place to hire Payton from the Saints in early 2019. That surely didn’t start with the Cowboys following the approved steps of the tampering policy (i.e., calling the Saints, reaching agreement on compensation, and then raising it with Payton). The Cowboys knew Payton was interested, they knew what it would take to get him, and they were ready to surrender the coach in the hand and activate the formal effort to land the Payton in the bush.

Also, the Dolphins weren’t the only Florida team to tamper with Brady. Former Bucs coach Bruce Arians publicly stated his interest in Brady and then-Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers before free agency began in 2020. It was a textbook violation that, like the vast majority of tampering violations, was ignored. Then, after signing Brady, the Bucs pushed to the media a hokey, concocted chain of events that covered their tampering tracks.

Look at it this way. If the Dolphins took advantage of an unauthorized head start in talking to Brady and didn’t get him, surely the team that got him didn’t wait until the start of free agency to speak to him for the first time.

So that’s the best explanation; the Dolphins aren’t alone in tampering. Most if not all teams do it, in some form or another. But, in this case, it gave the league office a way to whack the Dolphins for something, because finding that Ross attempted to lose games generally could have sparked a class action civil lawsuit and/or a criminal investigation as to whether the Dolphins attempted to lose specific games.

Again, Flores saved the day, by refusing to act on the hints his multi-billionaire boss was dropping. The reward Flores got for doing so was to get dropped by an owner who prefers to have coaches who will do what the owner wants, without having to expressly be ordered to do so."

Rob Walton and Greg Penner may be having second thoughts about what they’re about to get themselves into.

When the league’s owners meet next week in Minnesota to approve the purchase of the Broncos by the Wal-Mart heir and his son-in-law, Commissioner Roger Goodell is expected to “read the riot act” to all owners regarding tampering and tanking, in the aftermath of the suspension imposed Tuesday on Dolphins owner Stephen Ross.

As previously mentioned, the league gave Ross a pass on tanking, even though he apparently engaged in at least attempted tanking. Per the source, Goodell regards the issue as being very important, given the legalization of sports wagering. The next person who does it, if there is one, will get it a lot worse, the source predicts.

Ross should have gotten it a lot worse, frankly. He tried to tank. He did precisely what a multi-billionaire would do to send a message to those who hope to continue working for him, without having to actually order the proverbial code red. (Also known as the favorite phrase of Myles Simmons: “Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?”) And, because Flores not only refused to go along but also documented the owner’s efforts to pressure him to lose games in order to win improved draft position, Flores became persona non grata.

The source also predicted that the league will be much more rigorous on tampering. The problem with tampering is that the NFL lacks the resources to properly enforce the rules. It happens all the time, for that very reason. And it’s easy to think Ross wouldn’t have been scrutinized for it at all if the league weren’t already poking around on the tanking issue.

Thus, if the league tries to scare teams straight as to tampering, it likely won’t last for long. And folks will be more careful about it, more discreet. In time, it’ll go back to being rampant and reckless."

Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes learned a valuable lesson in the second half of the AFC Championship Game loss to the Bengals: Sometimes when you play not to lose, that makes you lose.

Mahomes told Kevin Clark of TheRinger.com that after jumping out to a big early lead, the Chiefs became so focused on playing it safe that they stopped doing the things that had brought them to that point.

“The second half of that game: I don’t want to say we relaxed, but I mean when you lead like you did, you want to make sure you win the game, but you don’t want to play like you’re playing not to lose,” Mahomes said. “And I feel like that’s what we did. As a team, we were playing not to lose, we were playing just to get to the Super Bowl. If you look, they didn’t do much different from the first half to the second half. We just didn’t execute at a high enough level. They were playing the same coverages and we weren’t executing. Then momentum gets in the other team’s favor and when you’re playing a good football team, bad stuff happens.”

When Mahomes’ third touchdown pass gave the Chiefs a 21-3 lead in the second quarter, it didn’t look like they were going to need to do much more to get to the Super Bowl. After the Chiefs’ 27-24 loss, Mahomes now knows he can’t allow that mentality to take hold in the middle of a game."

Jimmy Garoppolo is on the team, but he’s not really on the team.

He’s on the team just enough to land on the mandatory preseason depth chart. And he’s buried as the fourth-string option.

Garoppolo is behind Trey Lance, Nate Sudfeld, and Brock Purdy. It’s surprising to even see Garoppolo on the depth chart at all, given that he’s basically using the workplace as a free gym membership.

Two weeks ago, the 49ers finally abandoned the ruse that Garoppolo potentially would be paid $25 million to remain on the team. They’re waiting for a starter with another franchise to be injured and potentially lost for the year or most of it.

The only question at this point, as raised Monday and discussed on Tuesday’s PFT Live, is whether the 49ers would carry Garoppolo on the roster after the reduction to 53 players on August 30. Since his $24.2 million base salary doesn’t become guaranteed unless he’s on the active roster as of 4:00 p.m. ET on Saturday, September 10, maybe they’ll keep him on the 53-man roster for 12 days, while they wait for an eleventh-hour trade opportunity to emerge."

Last week, the Browns issued a strange statement in the aftermath of the decision from Judge Sue L. Robinson, who suspended quarterback Deshaun Watson for six games. The Browns, among other things, seemed to be trying to get the league to respect her ruling. For obvious reasons.

Now, with designee Peter Harvey considering the NFL’s appeal of the matter, Browns owner Jimmy Haslam is embracing a step that the team had hoped the league wouldn’t take.

“I’ll just say we’ll respect and honor the process,” Haslam said at the league meeting in Minnesota convened for the purpose of voting on the purchase of the Broncos, via Mark Maske of the Washington Post.

The Browns also were ready to “respect” Judge Robinson’s decision. The league, which embracing her factual findings, have disregarded her ultimate decision, believing the league believes it didn’t go far enough.

The Browns also insisted that Watson has shown remorse. Judge Robinson found that Watson has not.

There’s one sliver of overlap between management and labor in this case. The NFL Players Association and the Browns both want to minimize Watson’s absence. Remorse or no remorse, player and team want player back on the field.

Still, the Browns know that their broader interests require them to behave as one of the 32 member organizations of the NFL. They’ll “respect and honor” the appeal process. They’ll also likely dislike the outcome.

That said, there’s a silver lining for the Browns in the possibility of a full-season suspension. A 17-game ban would toll Watson’s contract for a full year, extending his commitment through 2027 and dropping his base salary in 2023 from $46 million to $1.035 million."

Bengals receiver Ja'Marr Chase had an outstanding first season in 2021, catching 81 passes for 1,455 yards with 13 touchdowns en route to winning AP offensive rookie of the year.

He was also a second-team All-Pro and selected to his first Pro Bowl.

But given that it was just Chase’s first season, the Bengals feel there’s plenty more out there for him. As one example, Chase appears likely to move around formations more as he begins his second season.

Cincinnati receivers coach Troy Walters noted that there’s a possibility Chase could even line up in the backfield, a la San Francisco’s Deebo Samuel.

“He’s going to be all over the field,” Walters said, via Geoff Hobson of the Bengals’ website. “We’re going to use him as many ways as we can. He’s a quick learner … That’s what great players want to do. They want to play everywhere.

“They understand the value of moving around and how you stress defenses sometimes in the slot. You don’t want defenses to focus on you. He’s embraced that challenge. Just find a way to create mismatches.”

Chase said he feels like lining up in the slot can give him more space to get open because he can get a mismatch with a linebacker or safety instead of a corner on the outside.

“It’s going to make our offense more explosive,” Chase said. “If we sit in there like robots and stay in the same position, they’re going to expect what’s coming. That’s why you move around.”

Chase’s emergence helped the Bengals improve to 13th in total yards and seventh in points scored last season. If he can take a significant jump by moving around more in his second season, that could go a long way to help Cincinnati defend its AFC North title."

Panthers offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo had to backtrack when he referred to Sam Darnold as the team’s starting quarterback in April, so he’s not making any proclamations about who will win this summer’s competition between Darnold and Baker Mayfield.

McAdoo said on Tuesday that he left his “crystal ball” in his other pants and stressed that the team is going to take its time before making any call about who will be on the field against the Browns in Week 1. McAdoo also said that he’s pleased that the quarterbacks “have conversations and help each other out” because a competition could lead to a “a cold, dark room.”

McAdoo then went the colorful route to share his confidence that things will turn out for the best as long as the Panthers are able to keep operating the same way.

This story is why.

The Lead: Ja'Marr Chase

What separates the great players from the very good players? I saw it the other day on a lonely field in the Midwest under a summer afternoon broiler, 92 degrees with 85 percent humidity, when the 2021 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year was the only football player at work.

Ja’Marr Chase was the last of 90 players on the field for the AFC champion Bengals on this dog-day Cincinnati afternoon, prepping to catch footballs shot out of a Jugs machine at short range at 40 mph. Chase started catching them with running back Chris Evans providing some distracting defense to make the catches tougher, but then Evans had to hustle inside for a meeting. So now, other than one other Bengal signing autographs 100 yards away for a few fans, and two equipment guys, the place was Bengal-free. Players and coaches were inside the air-conditioned locker room and offices.

Chase now had one problem: He needed a DB to play defense. He saw the stoop-shouldered boss of Bengals.com, Geoff Hobson, waiting for him to finish the drill so he could ask him a few questions. Hobson asked if Chase needed him to play defense.

“If you want to,” Chase said.

In his last football game, the Super Bowl, Chase was guarded by all-world corner Jalen Ramsey.

Now he’d be guarded by a gray-haired 63-year-old scribe who last played football in the Carter administration.

The object of this drill was not only for Chase to work on catching line-drive throws, but to have someone distract him with a tug on the jersey or wave a white Gatorade towel in his face. Hobson grabbed a towel and prepared to distract Chase from catching fastballs from the machine, just eight yards away.

“Wave it in front of my eyes,” Chase told Hobson.

“THWAP!” came the footballs, one after another, shot out of the machine, a Bengals aide handing them to equipment manager Adam Knollman, who fed them into the machine, each ball speeding 24 feet to the orange-gloved Chase. With Hobson fluttering the towel as each line drive zipped toward them, Chase softly hand-caught them, no body involved. Try that sometime.

The oversized rolling garbage can was empty. I called from the sideline: “How many in there?”

Equipment guy: “Well, about 40 in each.”

“I do three of ‘em,” Chase said. Most of the receivers and backs do one of these huge cans.

One hundred twenty balls. Twenty minutes of footballs shot out of a cannon. Hobson fluttering the towel in his face, no words spoken. Once, Hobson succeeded, distracting Chase so the ball clanged off his hands. (“I can tell my grandchildren I broke up a pass intended for Ja’Marr Chase,” Hobson said later.) Chase stopped the drill, ambled 25 yards downfield, picked it up and tossed it back to the assistant helping Knollman feed the machine with ball after ball.

Seemed an odd thing, Chase chasing the errant ball. Let that one go, I thought. Someone will pick it up later.

“Ja’Marr’s different,” Knollman, the equipment guy, said. “If he misses one, he’ll go get it, and the ball gets thrown back to us. He’ll have to do it again. He has to be perfect. He has to catch every one.”

When it was over, Chase took his helmet off. The sweat flowed in rivulets off his head. “Thank you,” he said to the equipment guys. A walk-through hour to get today’s script of plays down, two hours of practice, a five-minute “Get Better” period of catching tennis balls thrown fast, then 20 minutes of this.

We’d talked before practice. I asked him what he’d say to a kid watching this interview.

“Focus on you,” Chase said. “There’s so much you can control. If you want to be great, you’ve got to work at it constantly, every day, even when you’re tired. Gotta know when to push yourself, gotta know when to over-push yourself.”

This was over-pushing himself. It’s his world.

I said to him pre-practice: “You want to be the best, don’t you?”

“That’s my goal,” Chase said.

“No questions?”

“No questions.”

“What about you against [former LSU mate] Justin Jefferson?”

“I’m better than Justin.”

“Davante Adams?”

“I don’t know if I’m better … but I watch his film all the time. He told me he watches my film. That’s definitely something to keep me working.”

One day last week, Chase’s receivers coach, Troy Walters, used Powerpoint before practice to put up a quote from Bo Schembechler in the wide receivers meeting room.

EVERY DAY YOU’RE EITHER GETTING BETTER OR YOU’RE GETTING WORSE. YOU NEVER STAY THE SAME.

The same day, at practice, Walters, who has been significant in Chase’s growth and ethos, told him: “If you want to be really great, you need to be fundamentally sound every day, even in our walk-through.” Walters noticed on one route that Chase was supposed to take four steps off the line, but instead he took five. He admonished Chase. For the rest of the walk-through, Chase would look back at Walters after practicing a route, to see if he’d done it perfectly.

Chase credits Walters with pushing him and polishing him. After Chase had one of the best rookie seasons by a player in recent history—81 catches, 1,455 yards, 18.0 yards per catch, 13 TDs, then a rookie-record 368 postseason receiving yards—what happened a year ago in his rookie training camp seems so incongruous. Remember when he was dropping everything in sight last summer? Walters sat Chase down, showed him tape of how great he was at LSU and said, essentially, this too shall pass, and hard work will fix everything.

“We had a heart to heart,” Walters said. “He’s a great player. The word that comes to mind is freakish. But he understands the value of work, and how important it is in his success. I think what happened is he hadn’t played in the [2020] Covid season, and he just had some rust.”

There’s a drill Walters does with Chase that makes a lot of sense. Chase faces a wall. Walters stands behind him. With Chase focused on the wall, Walters throws a tennis ball hard. It bounces off the wall to a different place in Chase’s catch radius each time, and Chase tries to react instantaneously and grab it.

“Hand-eye coordination,” Chase told me. “Reaction in a split-second is crucial to being great.”

I didn’t sense a lot of the-missed-Super Bowl-chance haunts us out of the Bengals. My theory: This team won fortunate dogfights at Tennessee and Kansas City when Ryan Tannehill and Patrick Mahomes threw late picks, and Evan McPherson kicked 95-yard field goals in both games to get Cincinnati to the big game. I didn’t sense that losing to that great defensive front and Matthew Stafford/Cooper Kupp is a nightmare for Cincinnati going forward. For the Bengals to get to a second straight Super Bowl, the retooled offensive line needs to build a better shield around Joe Burrow (72 sacks in 21 games, by far the most in football). Chase, Tee Higgins and Tyler Boyd combined for 222 catches, 3,374 yards and 24 TDs last year. It’s absurd to just say, Duplicate that, or do better, but the Bengals need a healthy, full dose of their trio to be great again. Because now the rest of the league looks at the Bengals on the schedule as a challenge, not a bye week.

There’s another reason the uber-popular Chase is particularly valuable to the franchise in a time when the Bengals have taken over the local sports scene: perspective beyond his 22 years. The other day, Knollman said to Chase he appreciated him signing autographs for so many kids after practice.

“These people wait a long time for this,” Chase said. “And it doesn’t last forever.”

Many topics after a full week on the road. I was joined by my NBC producer/videographer team of Kelsey Bartels and Morgan Miller and — surprise! — by new NBC teammate Jason Garrett for weekend stops. Started in Cincinnati Monday. Ended with a Sunday drive to St. Joseph, Mo., for Kansas City camp today. In this week’s column:

Aaron Rodgers, in a don’t-worry-be-happy state these days, tells me about his mind-bending trip to Peru experiencing psychedelic substances…and that’s not even the most significant story in Green Bay, IMO.

Deshaun Watson got off easy, but probably not for long.

The NFL had to hammer Stephen Ross, who I think was fortunate too. But the reverberations, involving Tom Brady and Bryce Young and how the NFL sausage is made, are many.

Packers camp 10

GREEN BAY—In 11 minutes at his locker inside Lambeau Field, Aaron Rodgers used the word “love” 20 times in a 1,597-word conversation. He relayed a recent exchange with veteran teammate Randall Cobb. “He was saying I was such a more gentle person,” Rodgers said with a slight grin that didn’t go away while we spoke. “I said yeah, I love myself a lot better so it’s easier to love other people and give them forgiveness and not jump on somebody’s ass if they make a mistake.”

Of all the things I never thought I’d be writing about covering the NFL, the reigning MVP having a three-day experience with the Quechuan natives in South America ingesting psychedelics would be high on the list. Now that I’ve got your attention, can I interrupt that for a second with a prediction about the 2022 Packers?

I think the addition of new special-teams coach Rich Bisaccia will be more significant to this Green Bay season than the subtraction of a great wide receiver, Davante Adams.

(Maybe it’s me on those psychedelics.)

I think that because history shows Rodgers figures out his targets every year, even when things look dire, and early camp star Romeo Doubs looks like a major early contributor at receiver. In the practice I saw, Doubs physically bested corner Eric Stokes on a long gain over the middle, made a diving catch in a two-minute period and made two other impressive contested catches. The 132nd pick in the draft from Nevada is long and appears unafraid, and the respect he’s getting from defenders was impressive to see. Twice after Doubs torched a DB, others DBs came and tapped him on the helmet, like, We see you, Rook.

Re Bisaccia: The Packers have had lethally bad special teams in recent years—they lost the divisional playoff game to San Francisco last year because of them—and now they have one of the best kicking-team coaches in the game with the addition of the interim Raiders coach last year. Bisaccia’s impact will be huge.

Now…let’s discuss ayahuasca. That was the talk of camp. First I had to learn what ayahuasca is. Per Wikipedia, it is consumed mostly as a tea to promote a placid state of being, and can be done over days: “People who have consumed ayahuasca report having mystical experiences and spiritual revelations regarding their purpose on earth, the true nature of the universe, and deep insight into how to be the best person they possibly can…Westerners typically describe experiences with psychological terms like ‘ego death.’”

I thought of different ways to present this, but then I re-read Rodgers’ words to me, and it’s such an unusual story that I decided to let him tell it. Slightly condensed, here it is, from Rodgers:

“I have a dear friend that I’ve known for 25 years that went on an ayahuasca journey in 2019. He came back, and we played golf one day and he told me all about it. I said, okay, I think it’s time that I do it. So we put together a trip to Peru [in 2020] and had a great experience. Then I went again this offseason and had another beautiful experience. Different, very different. Different size group, different amount of days.

“We sat three different nights with the medicine. I came in with an intention of doing a lot of healing of other relationships and bringing in certain people to have conversations with. Most of the work was around myself and figuring out what unconditional love of myself looks like of myself. In doing that, allowing me to understand how to unconditionally love other people but first realizing it’s gotta start with myself. I’ve got to be a little more gentle with myself and compassionate and forgiving because I’ve had some negative voices, negative self-talk, for a long time. A lot of healing went on. There’s things—images from the nights, the journeys—that will come up in dreams or during the day I’ll think about something that happened or something that I thought about. It’s constantly trying to integrate those lessons into everyday life.”

How’d it change your life?

“Man, it’s hard to answer that question with a short answer. But a lot of different ways. The most important way was really that self-love part. I think it’s unlocked a lot of my heart. Being able to fully give my heart to my teammates, my loved ones, relationships because I can fully embrace unconditionally myself. Just didn’t do that for a long time. I was very self-critical. When you have so much judgment on yourself it’s easy to transfer that judgment to other people. When you figure out a better way to love yourself, I think you can love people better because you’re not casting the same judgment you cast on yourself on other people. I’m really thankful for that.”

I asked about his fraught and estranged relationship with his family in California, and whether that might now get fixed.

“Honestly, that was a big intention I brought into the second journey this offseason,” he said. “I really felt like I wanted to surrender and open up to the medicine for some healing to come through and some direction on how to kind of go about that. And it didn’t. It didn’t necessarily. The big message was unconditionally loving myself is the key to being able to heal all relationships—with them, past relationships with lovers, whatever it might be…So that gives me a lot of hope in healing at some point. There was nothing specific that came through in my three nights of journey, per se, but it was everything to learn how to love myself better because every relationship is changed from that standpoint. Including the way I look at them [family members] and the hope I have for reconciliation at some point.”

I told him what I’d observed in my one-practice snapshot and here in the locker room. (Which I admit is a shallow way to draw any conclusion about a person. I don’t really know Rodgers. This is my Polaroid view of the ’20 and ’21 MVP—that’s it.) He looked happy on the field, thrilled to see practice visitor Jordy Nelson, hugging Nelson’s wife, laughing with Cobb, talking and smiling in an interaction with Doubs. Placid man.

He brought up all the coaches and players who he says make the game fun for him when I asked if there was a time when he was been down on football and now he loved it more.

“I don’t think it’s that,” he said. “I think [love of the game] has just deepened. My love for football has been there since I was 5 or 6 years old. But there’s a difference between loving something and being in love with something. Right? I think we can all relate to that. Loving people or being in love with people, loving things or being in love with things. I think I just fell back in love with football the last few years. It’s due to a mindset but also the people. I really do. I give credit to the Nathaniel Hacketts of the world and Luke Getsy, Justin Outten, Matt LaFleur—and Tom Clements coming back. Randall Cobb coming back and Marcedes Lewis. Robert Tonyan and Allen Lazard and Mason Crosby, and of course David Bakhtiari. All the people who make this thing so fun. I love people. I love my teammates so much. I love the opportunity to do this.

“But I think I just fell in love with it a little bit deeper. Again, I think a lot of that is due to the work that I’ve done on myself. It hasn’t all been just the ayahuasca journey. It’s been therapy. It’s been meditation. It’s been changing habits that weren’t giving me any type of joy. Eating better. Taking care of myself a little bit better. Being more gentle with myself. All those things have allowed me to look at each day with a little more joy.”

So, the obvious question is: does this violate the NFL’s substance-abuse policy? I don’t know. Checked with the league late Friday, and got a no-comment. But it’s likely the league never thought of South American psychedelics when creating the substance abuse policy. I was told over the weekend that the league will very likely not do anything to Rodgers retroactively because he’s not tested positive for a banned substance, and as for the future, who knows?

More in Ten Things below about Rodgers’ football regrets, but I wanted to get to the big thing around the Packers this summer: Wefense.

That’s what Bisaccia calls his special teams. Not offense, not defense, but a patchwork of the entire team in the kicking game. Last year, it was more like awfulfense. Flashback to the divisional game in frigid Lambeau in January. Pack up 10-3. Six minutes left. Niners ball at the Green Bay 19, fourth and one. The defense stones a Niner rush, loss of two, and now the Packers have to run out the clock on a zero-degree wind-chill night. But they do nothing on the fortuitous possession, and they have to punt, and punt front breaks down, and the Corey Bojorquez punt is blocked and recovered for a touchdown. Niners won on a field goal at :00.

Lots of things went wrong, but special teams coordinator Maurice Drayton got fired after a year on the job, a year continuing the tradition of disastrous play on kicking teams. After some aggressive recruiting by coach LaFleur, and a reported $2-million-a-year contract, Bisaccia was a Packer.

Bisaccia’s “wefense” ethos, as he explained Sunday, is that a special teams unit takes players from everywhere on the roster, and all must play unselfishly.

“On a punt team,” he said, “your wing might be a safety, one flyer might be a wide receiver, one might be a cornerback, the personal protector might be a fullback. It takes the whole team. I tell the players, ‘The only ‘I’ I want to hear is what can I do to help us win.’”

Bisaccia has brought a sense of vigor and importance to early practices. When he thought the 11 punt-team players were lethargic coming out of the huddle on one play, he ran 60 yards to get to them and yell: “Get back in the huddle! Come outta the huddle like you mean it!”

LaFleur said Bisaccia “can love players tough better than any coach I’ve ever met. He’s ultra-demanding but earns their respect by really caring about them. It’s an art, what he’s able to do.”

Bisaccia told me this job reminds him of the first NFL job he took—in Tampa Bay in 2002 on Jon Gruden’s staff.

“That was a team, with Warren Sapp and Derrick Brooks and Ronde Barber and John Lynch and Simeon Rice, that was built to win now,” he said. “I feel like I’m in the same position here with Aaron Rodgers and this team. I feel that same sense of urgency. It fuels me.”

The special teams need a jolt. I say Rodgers solves the receiver jigsaw the way he always does. He might struggle a bit replacing the best third- down and red-zone receiver in football, Adams, but give him time. If Green Bay can finally overcome its recent history of blown January chances, Rodgers will be the most vital element. But Bisaccia’s impact must be felt too.

NFL's big decisions

Watson

In the wake of the news that independent arbitrator Sue L. Robinson ruled Cleveland quarterback Deshaun Watson should be suspended for the first six games of the 2022 season, six points:

1. The length of the ban is six games too short. Robinson spends a chunk of the report criticizing the NFL for suggesting a full-season ban with no precedent, or as she says: “The NFL is attempting to impose a more dramatic shift in its culture without the benefit of fair notice to—and consistency of consequence for—those in the NFL subject to the policy.” Come on. Should the NFL have a discipline handbook that says, 10-15 civil lawsuits alleging lewd conduct against—8 games; more than 15—a full season?

2. Robinson’s characterization of the offenses as “non-violent sexual assault” really feels wrong. Technically, I suppose you could say that the acts Watson was accused of were “non-violent,” but the accuser described a perverse act, a crime. Reading Robinson’s ruling, I felt she minimized the acts she finds Watson to have committed. That’s certainly how the most public of Watson’s accusers, Ashley Solis, saw it. “What do the actions of the NFL say to little girls who have suffered at the hands of someone perceived to have power?” she said in a statement after the ruling. “That it is not a big deal. That they don’t care. Tough s—. That’s what I’ve taken from their actions.” Except it’s not over. The system set up to rule on such discipline is obviously league-slanted, because the commissioner or his designee hears the appeal. And it would be surprising if designee Peter Harvey doesn’t add some teeth to the sanction on Watson.

3. I hear there’s not much of a chance for the two sides to settle this case before Harvey rules. But a settlement is the best idea. Increase the sanction to 10 games, let Watson back for the post-Thanksgiving stretch of seven games that includes a game against each division foe. Ten games feels light to me, but in the words of noted middle-ground-seeker Paul Tagliabue, “All’s well that ends.” Period.

4. One influential NFL person told me on this trip that it doesn’t sit well with the league or 31 other owners that the Browns rigged the Watson contract so that his suspension would cause him to lose only a fraction of his 2022 compensation. A suspension of six games, for instance, means Watson would be docked six-eighteenths (there are 18 game weeks, including the bye) of his $1.035-million salary, or $344,655. So if Robinson’s suspension with no additional fine other than six game checks stands, it means Watson would lose 0.7 percent of his $46-million total compensation this year. That’s almost absurd beyond words. I expect Harvey to be under some pressure to levy a multi-million-dollar fine of Watson in whatever he rules.

5. Let’s say Watson misses the first 10 games and comes back to play. That would mean he’d have gone 99 weeks without playing a football game, and he’d be coming back to play with a new team with receivers he’d never played a game with. At one of my camp stops, I asked an offensive coach how he thought Watson would play after such a long layoff. “Everybody’s assuming he’ll come back and be Deshaun Watson. I wonder. He’ll be working out, and he’ll probably find some receivers to throw to while he’s out, but being out that long and coming back with a new team—there’s no guarantee he’ll be that good this year.”

6. Blows my mind Watson has shown no public remorse in this case.

Dolphins

In the wake of the news that the Dolphins were docked first- and third-round picks, and owner Stephen Ross was suspended till mid-October and fined $1.5-miilion for tampering with Tom Brady while the quarterback was under contract to both New England and Tampa Bay, six points:

1. Ross denied virtually everything and seemed outraged at his organization being found guilty of tampering. But he’s lucky the league’s investigation gave him a pass on what could have made the NFL force him to sell the team—charges by Brian Flores that the owner offered him $100,000 per game to lose in order to better their draft position. The league couldn’t conclusively corroborate Flores’ tanking story, which saved Ross.

2. The league has a “legal tampering” period prior to the start of free-agency each year, during which time teams and agents can come to agreements on new contract. But enforcement of regular tampering has been lax, to say the least. There’s a no-harm-no-foul ethos—at least that’s my sense—when it comes to pre-free-agency contact with player agents and players, and I think that’s part of this case. This is Roger Goodell drawing a line and saying, Tampering stops now. You’re all warned.

3. This makes Tom Brady look bad, obviously, like it’s okay for him to play by a different set of rules because he’s Tom Brady. Maybe he knew this was coming, and that’s why he’s had one press availability in training camp, and none since this news came down Tuesday. Whenever he does speak, this is going to be very hard to justify in any way.

4. Great point by a good source: “Usually when you’re investigated for tampering, you’ve succeeded at getting something valuable. Miami got nothing, and it cost them a one and a three. I can’t imagine a worse outcome.”

5. This is the upshot that really hurts Miami: Before this happened, they had their own 2023 first-round pick and also San Francisco’s. Let’s just say Tua Tagovailoa is mediocre this year and Miami decides it wants to try to get in position to move up to get a quarterback in the ’23 draft. Theoretically, if their two picks were in the 15 to 22 range (just spitballing), maybe they could package those two plus their one in 2024 to move up to three or four to get a quarterback. That’s out the window now.

6. This ratchets up the pressure on Tagovailoa. Now there’s really no Plan B for 2023, unless the Miami braintrust falls in love next spring with a Kenny Pickett type talent and he falls in round one. Maybe you’d say it’s great for Tagovailoa—he can play free and easy knowing it’s going to be his job going forward. And maybe that’s the case. But I say there’s just as good a chance he feels the heat of, Dude, you simply cannot fail. He’s certainly set up to win with Tyreek Hill and Mike McDaniel on board now, and he needs to win now.

Titans Camp 20

NASHVILLE—In GM Jon Robinson’s office the other day, we were talking about how the Titans are regularly disregarded when discussing Super Bowl contenders…yet the team is on a three-year playoff streak and was the AFC’s one seed last year. Robinson smiled and said, “I’m gonna play you a song real quick,” he said, and started fiddling with his iPhone.

“Eric Church. ‘The Outsiders.’ That’s who we are,” Robinson said. Now came Church, the country star.

They’re the in crowd, we’re the other ones

It’s a different kind of cloth that we’re cut from

And so on. This is an interesting team with a braintrust that can patch holes as well as any team in football. Robinson and Mike Vrabel built a rock-ribbed defense and strong run game, with a pretty good pass game too (until divisional weekend), and they survived a ridiculous spate of injuries to lock in the AFC’s top seed. Tennessee used a league-record 91 players last year, won 12 games, and became the first team in NFL history to have eight wins over teams with winning records…despite missing Derrick Henry for half the year with a foot injury.

Vrabel gave a Belichickian response when I asked him about the Titans’ image. “I try not to focus on things that don’t matter,” he said. “We just try to build a foundation to help us withstand the ups and downs of an NFL season.”

The last time we saw the Titans was a down of epic proportions—the 19-16 home loss to Cincinnati to end the season. Ryan Tannehill threw three interceptions, one on the Titans’ first offensive play and another, the dagger, on the Titans’ final offensive play of the game. That pick, with 20 seconds left in the fourth quarter of a 16-all game, led to the winning 52-yard Cincinnati field goal at :00. And it led to huge questions about the future of Tannehill in Tennessee. His resume is overall good, but he’s lost three straight playoff games, averaging 17.3 points in the three. It would have cost the Titans a $57.4-million dead-cap charge in 2022 to move on from him, and so that was never an option.

But there’s another part of this story, a mental-health part.

“The game was heartbreaking,” Tannehill told me. “Put me in a dark spot.”

A really dark spot. He’s out of it now, mostly, but for the first time in all his years playing football, the game knocked him for such a mental loop he had to seek professional help.

“I hadn’t really been in that spot before,” he said after a broiler of a practice. “It was weeks and weeks of not really sleeping, and then kind of slowly got better from there, working my way through it. It wasn’t something that I just passively got through. I was intentionally seeking out help, talking to somebody and trying to work through the mental side of it.

“The mental side is such a big thing for everybody in life, but especially in sports. We talk about it as an organization. We have guys that help us with our bodies, help us train. We also have people that help with our minds. Being able to take advantage of that and kind of destigmatize the mental side of things. We’re all gonna go through something at different points in our life. It’s okay, right? Now you have the opportunity to work through it and be intentional about growing through the process and moving forward.

“You’re not pushing away the feelings. You’re acknowledging the feelings. You’re really feeling them and digging through why you’re feeling them, and then moving past it at that point. You’re not stuffing it away and hoping just to never feel it again. You’re acknowledging it, knowing it’s there, and then moving through it.

“Now, it’s a scar. That’s kind of how I’ve described it is that it’s a scar. It’s always there. You remember it. But it’s not a wound anymore. It doesn’t hurt the same. You acknowledge like yeah that sucked. But this is a new year. We have everything out in front of us. What happened last year, whether it was good or bad, it doesn’t matter at this point. You have to take each day as its own and take advantage of it.”

Teammates, staffers, coaches all talk of Tannehill being the same positive guy he’s always been. Now they’ve got to hope he truly is past it and can be the guy who’s gone 30-13 in three Titans seasons. His future in Tennessee probably depends on it.

As for the team, and the mental side of the game, the most important guy in Tannehill’s football life is squarely behind him—and his openness about the mental side of the game.

“We spend a lot of time in this game on our bodies,” Mike Vrabel said. “We need to spend as much time on our minds.”

Bears Camp

I want you to look at this photo of me and Bears wideout Darnell Mooney Friday after practice. I was explaining something about the importance of a quarterback and receiver being in perfect alignment. I said to him: “In that incredible New England comeback from 28-3 in the Super Bowl against Atlanta, guess which wide receiver had the most targets in the fourth quarter and overtime for the Patriots. Malcolm Mitchell.” That’s when his face got that way. Like, who is Malcolm Mitchell? Rookie. Played only one year in the NFL. Bad knee forced him to quit. I said, “When I asked Tom Brady about it, he said there was a reason for it: 112 practices.” All those comeback routes Mitchell ran late in the game and Brady targeted him on were because they’d run them a couple of hundred times in practice, and Brady trusted him implicitly.

My point: I’d just watched Justin Fields practice in the new Luke Getsy offense imported from Green Bay, and I felt very much that it’s a work in progress. Fields rolled right several times, a la Aaron Rodgers, and looked for a receiver, and he ended up tucking it and running. It’s only with time that someone—Mooney, rookie Velus Jones, Dante Pettis, tight end Cole Kmet — or maybe more than one will get in tune with Fields, and the young QB will be able to find a receiver instead of running. Nothing wrong with running, of course — Fields is fleet and quick. But it’s good to know if he rolls right six times a game, he has a legit run or pass option five or six times.

“I’m happy you shared that story with me,” Mooney said. “I’m not sure how long it will take. But that makes perfect sense.”

This is what a new offense is like, and this is what a new regime is like. Rookie GM Ryan Poles says he doesn’t like calling this a teardown, but what do you call a camp roster with 54 of 91 players brand new…and the personnel staff new, and the coaching staff new, and the franchise quarterback in his 16th month on campus?

This is going to take a while, but Poles isn’t taking shortcuts, and that’s good. When Poles traded 31-year-old Khalil Mack to the Chargers for second- and sixth-round picks, it was a signal that Poles and coach Matt Eberflus want to build for the long haul. That’s why I don’t think this is a make-or-break year for Fields. He’ll have every chance to win the job long term, and patience will be a virtue with this staff. Getsy is a teacher of the first order. “Probably the best quarterback coach I’ve had in my life,” said Fields.

When I watched Fields Friday, what I thought needed the most work was his anticipation throws, his rhythm throws. Not to harp on Brady, but what became rote with him was knowing precisely where each receiver would be on each route, so he could throw when the receiver wasn’t looking, certain of the spot he’d be when the ball was released. Fields isn’t there yet.

“We’re working on the rhythm throws,” Eberflus said.

Fields gets it. He knows mastering an offense means being able to throw ball after ball to a spot, not waiting to see him be open. The key will be for Fields and for the fans to understand this will take time, and lots of the final pieces aren’t on this roster yet.

“Each day I feel we take a step forward,” said Fields. That’s important.

I’m not bullish on the Bears to contend this year. On the total rebuilds — Bears, Giants, Texans, Jags — that’s really okay. In fact, it’s preferable. I am bullish on the groundwork being laid by Poles and Eberflus. The respect they have for Bears history, and the desire to get the Bears back to contention, was evident Friday. Eberflus, when setting up his office, wanted to honor the history of the franchise and make every player aware that their jobs are to return the franchise to prominence. In the space behind his desk that most coaches reserve for family photos or mementos, the new coach asked for pictures of the nine Bears with retired numbers. When players sit in his office, he asks them to name at least three of them. Some get Walter Payton. Some get Dick Butkus. But it’s ancient history to most. But they matter, and Eberflus wants to keep them alive for this generation.

Also behind his desk, in the middle of display of the great Bears, are two empty plexiglass shelves, small ones, and two empty spots at the base of the display. Eberflus wanted the two shelves for George Halas Trophies, emblematic of the NFC champions. And he wanted the spaces below to be there for two Super Bowl trophies.

That’s right: Super Bowl trophies. They don’t call them Lombardi Trophies around here, by the way.

Vin Scully: 1927-2022 30

The greatest baseball announcer in history (there, I said it) was pretty good at football too. At the time of his death at 94, it’s fitting to recall his greatest moment in a football booth. He called The Catch, the winning TD grab by Dwight Clark in the 1981 San Francisco-Dallas NFC Championship Game and left football broadcasting immediately thereafter. It was his call to make that his last football call.

Six years ago, Scully was asked if he regretted not grabbing onto the NFL and becoming a huge name announcing football.

I loved his answer. He stayed with his passion.

“Oh, no, not at all,” Scully said. “The reason I did the NFL was, first of all, I was offered the opportunity and I gave it a thought. And I kept thinking, you know, I’ve been doing baseball so long that I could fall into a trap of just doing it by rote and I thought I could use a challenge. So I was offered the opportunity to do football and golf. And I thought, I need to work harder in another sport.

“So I used the NFL as much as I possibly could just trying to wake me up. And I was privileged to work with some wonderful experts. Then I wound up with Hank Stram doing a game that will be memorable, I guess, the one called ‘The Catch,’ with Joe Montana and Dwight Clark. When that game ended, I got on the airplane and I was emotionally worn out from doing it and making sure I didn’t make some horrific mistake. But when I got on the airplane I thought, ‘Okay, I’ve done it. I’ve gotten the boost that I needed for my energy.’ That was it. When the plane landed and I got home, I told my family, ‘That’s a great game on which to call it a football career.’ That was it. It served a marvelous purpose to just to reawaken me, I guess.”

Scully, I always thought, did four things perfectly: He relaxed listeners with a lovely lilting voice, never feeling forced or awkward—just neighborly. He was perfectly informed about everything he discussed. He told incredible stories, and told them like he was sitting next to you, talking to you and only you. He could put a gigantic baseball game or part of it into historical context immediately, such as the historical and social implications of Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth’s home run record playing in the city of Atlanta.

Listen. You can hear him say it. Unrushed. Measured. Important.

“What a marvelous moment for baseball; what a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia; what a marvelous moment for the country and the world. A black man is getting a standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol. And it is a great moment for all of us, and particularly for Henry Aaron.”

Worker bee too. Elliott Kalb, his statistician, tells a story about Scully doing an NBC Game of the Week game at Wrigley Field on a Saturday afternoon. He was due back in LA for a Sunday afternoon game and so had a flight Saturday evening to Los Angeles. On the way to the airport, the car broke down. Scully got out. He hitch-hiked to the airport. He wasn’t going to miss the Sunday game.

Bob Costas offered this:

“The combination of his unique talent, his command of the craft, his pleasing and distinctive voice, his lyrical style, his command of language, his enormous frame of reference. Combine all of that, and then spread it over his 67-year career. A huge amount of baseball history. His first year, 1950, was Connie Mack’s last year managing the Philadelphia A’s. Mack was born in 1862, during the Civil War.

“And…when you take that part into account and the fact that he starts with the Brooklyn Dodgers, not just any team, but Jackie Robinson’s Boys of Summer Dodgers. If he was the voice of any other team, relatively nondescript team, he’d still be a Hall of Fame broadcaster. But he was the voice of the Dodgers. Think of all that history. All those compelling characters. The circumstances of his career elevate his talent, which was already top-of-the-mountain talent.”

Tampa Bay linebacker Devin White, entering his fourth season, on his love of horses. He owns 30 of them.

“As a kid, being from Cotton Valley, La., that’s all we did. Horse country. I always rather have a horse than a dog because you gotta feed the dog, walk the dog. The horse does all the work for you. You just sit on his back. So that made life easy, you know?

“I got a dog now, a Blue Heeler. Look it up. Cattle dog. One of the best dogs I ever had in my life. She follows my horse. I don’t gotta walk her. She follows us when we go on rides.”

Why a horse over a dog?

“The horse does the work. When I go out to enjoy my horse, I’m on his back. Or her back. She’s doing all the moving. I’m just sitting up there. If you’re on a dog walk, you gotta work and the dog’s gotta work. It just makes more sense. I can go hunt on my horse. I can go through trails on my horse. I can do whatever. I can ride my horse to the store. I can’t ride a dog to the store.

“Yup, I ride my horse to the store [in Louisiana]. Tie it up outside, like the old days. Walk in the store, get whatever I need, come out. You stop at the store, tie him up and go in there. I would say a lot of people do that.”

King of the Road

Road-related snippets from the past eight days:

CINCINNATI—Orioles-Reds, Great American Ballpark, Sunday afternoon, lovely day, bottom of the first. Joey Votto coming to the dish. His walkup music: “Jolene,” by Dolly Parton. Just to be sure I wasn’t hearing things, I made sure to listen before his second at-bat—there cannot be a major-league player with Dolly Parton as the walkup singer. Sure enough, this wafted over the speakers when Votto came up a second time:

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

I’m begging you please don’t take my man…

NASHVILLE—The Last Supper with Dom Bonvissuto and fam came at Lockeland Table in East Nashville, a day after he edited Football Morning in America for the last time. Lockeland Table’s one of my favorite spots on the tour. So Dom has left the nest. He edited this column for almost 13 years and is moving to a new gig at Outkick. I have only one negative to report about the meal: Dom had the Southern Hawaiian pizza, with peaches on it. Dom! Come on! Peaches on pizza! So good to see my little buddy, Jude, going into sixth grade this week, and Dom’s wife, Danny, just a terrific person. Goodbye’s not forever, Dom.

NASHVILLE TO TAMPA—Evening flight, Southwest. I have had very good post-Covid fortune about all things air travel, but that ended here. When I boarded, I grabbed the bulkhead window, with the aisle seat occupied and the middle seat empty. A few minutes later, a large man, tall and quite wide, sat in the middle. Unfortunately, I was pressed to my left pretty far. There was no room to move. Two hours of this. Hmmm. I excused myself and moved down to 26B. Center seat, a bit of room. In a past life, I’d be fuming. After 42 years of marriage, I think Ann King’s approach to life—why get bothered by things you can’t control?—is rubbing off. In a year of travel nightmares, I haven’t had a single one. So two hours of an inconvenience…that’s the travel life sometimes.

TAMPA—I want to tell you about rain. End-of-the-earth rain, buckets and buckets of it, .95 inches in an hour, as we left the Bucs training facility a bit after 1 p.m. A bolt of lightning, from sky to earth, with crackling thunder, preceded the incredible storm. The Bucs handed me an umbrella to walk the eight steps to the car my crew pulled up to the front door of the place, and even with umbrella, when I get into the car, I was as wet as if I’d just walked out of the swimming pool. Writing this on a plane to Minneapolis, a few hours later. My socks are soaked through. My sneakers, same. Man, the rain on the gulf coast of Florida is serious.

GREEN BAY—Have I sung the praises of Lodge Kohler enough? It’s my favorite hotel on the circuit by far, with location (across the street from Lambeau Field, in the cool Titletown District), old Packers photos in every room, modern rooms with crazy-good Kohler showers, bottle of Charles Woodson’s “Intercept” pinot noir in the room as a welcome gift. Midwest-friendly. The best. One quibble, and this is Everywhere USA in airports and restaurants and public spaces and it’s really quite mad: Lobby/restaurant music stuck in the eighties. (Seventies, maybe.) Sereneded at breakfast Thursday with Solsbury Hill by Peter Gabriel, Hot Legs by Rod Stewart, Burnin’ for You by Blue Oyster Cult, Long Train Running by the Doobie Brothers, The Joker by the Steve Miller Band. Can’t we progress in music a bit, people?

I owe a bit of an assist on the Green Bay trip to the Packers’ media-relations czar, Jason Wahlers. Ten minutes after leaving my confab with Aaron Rodgers at Lambeau Thursday afternoon, my lower left crown on a molar popped out chewing a protein bar. I asked Wahlers if he knew a dentist who might be able to see me. He found one. His dentist, Matthew Nelson of Parc Village Dental, could see me, and it took him 25 minutes from start of procedure to end to adhesive that baby back in. He was curious about whether I’d talked to Rodgers about the psychedelic mushrooms. I said yes, and he said he’d have to read the column Monday. Thanks for the save, Dr. Nelson.

ON I-94 WEST TO MINNEAPOLIS—Jason Garrett, the new NBC Football Night in America analyst, joined us at Bears camp, fresh off his first NFL show Thursday night in Canton. Two hours sleep. But he was going to see the Bears, Vikings and Packers in three days as part of his homework for the new gig, and he was all smiles when we met him in Lake Forest, home of the Bears. First thing first. The drive. Four hundred miles. “Six hours!” he said. I explained that three decades of training-camp travel in the summer, with storms and flight delays and airport crowds, had sent me to cars almost exclusively. Seven hours or less, with my NBC-appointed helpers doing 70 percent of the driving (I do some; I love driving), and we always drove. In this big Ford Explorer, I could nap or type in the back, fairly efficiently. So Jason was in. We got lunch at Culver’s in Wisconsin—he’d never had the custardy Wisco delight—and he napped for maybe 90 minutes around Wisconsin Dells. Then he woke up. “Want to play a game?” he said. “Twenty questions?” We had three rounds of the people-places-things car-ride time-killer. He went first. On the 16th question, I asked, “Is it George Halas?” Yes. My turn. I picked a Kit Kat Bar. On the 20th question—clutch play here—Kelsey Bartels said, “Is it a Kit Kat Bar?” So it was done, and we were at a late dinner at my favorite Twin Cities spot, Pizzeria Lola, and Garrett was into his pizza, telling stories, totally content. “One of the all-time great days,” Garrett said. Another camp convert!

Six games is an outrage. From Chris, of Cleveland: “Most of my friends agree with me—six games for [Deshaun] Watson is terrible. Way too light. You won’t believe how many people who love the Browns are pissed at this so-called penalty.”

I don’t think it’ll stay at six games, Chris. But as I wrote higher in this column, I think most of the women who were involved in the Watson accusations would strongly disagree with the arbitrator, Sue L. Robinson, minimizing the seriousness of the offenses by calling it “nonviolent sexual conduct.” I would agree with you and those who criticize Robinson’s ruling.

Don’t slight Tomlin’s intelligence. From Chris Wilkinson of McGeheysville, Va.: “I’m a faithful reader of the column. One thing I notice is that you frequently refer to white coaches as brilliant and intelligent. With that in mind, I was disappointed that your profile of Mike Tomlin focused on his leadership and communication. These are important. However, you mentioned little to nothing about his play-calling, schemes, or other qualities establishing his clear intelligence and smarts. It’s important to recognize that these omissions signal implicit bias and feed into racial norms Black people face every day.”

That’s a good point, Chris. Thanks for bringing it to my attention. But I was not writing a profile of Mike Tomlin. I was not writing much about the architecture of the offense or defense, or really anything other than what a good job he does as a leader of men in a time of major transition. I agree that a longer profile of him would call for some of what you say, examination and praise of what he’s done in X’s and O’s and motivation. Your larger point, though, is fair.

Why not Miami? From Tony Reed: I would like to ask why you aren’t going to the Dolphins training camp (it’s my team). It just seems like lots of good storylines this year and as an avid reader I would like to hear your thoughts on what you see in person.”

Hi, Tony. Originally the Dolphins were on my itinerary, but the only day I could fit them into my rubric the way it turned out was a day the players were off. Certainly would have been a good spot to visit with the news of this week.

Why not the Jets? From Jeff Brosnan (on Twitter): “Don’t understand your reasoning for going to Giants training camp and ignoring the Jets who have a better team and far more potential. You’ll mea culpa this down the road.”

Can’t hit ‘em all, Jeff. Picked the Giants because I hadn’t been to their camp in a few years (seven or eight, I think) and because of the fact that they’d done something they hadn’t done since 1979—hire a GM and coach both from outside the organization. I always try to hit teams with good stories and teams that might go far.

RIP Vin. From Charles Freeman of Los Angeles: “Many years and several careers ago, I was a meter reader here in Los Angeles. One of the houses I read in Pacific Palisades was that of Mr. Scully and his family. I‘d sometimes see him at the house and running errands in the Palisades Village. Then, in the early 1980s, I became friendly with Dodgers player Derrell Thomas and got to meet Mr. Scully at the stadium. He was gracious and kind every time I encountered him. We all know his voice and the greatness of his long and legendary career. He’s probably one of the last to ever see both Babe Ruth and Henry Aaron play. He was close to Jackie Robinson and called Fernando Valenzuela’s games decades later. He told us about Koufax’s 4 no-hitters, called Dodgers World Series triumphs and one sad Sunday afternoon in July 1993, he gave us the sad news that Don Drysdale had passed in his Montreal hotel room. Heaven’s radio station has a new announcer tonight.”

Wonderfully put, Charles. Thank you.

10 Things I Think I Think 40

1. I think when owners meet in Minneapolis Tuesday to approve the $4.65-billion bid to buy the Broncos by Rob Walton, it’ll be the formality of formalities. “This meeting could be a five-minute Zoom,” one club exec told me over the weekend. You don’t say no to pockets that deep.

2. I think, with opening night a month from today, the scariest injury news for any team in the league is the elbow soreness that Matthew Stafford has. The Rams have downplayed it. Stafford, after throwing on Saturday, downplayed it. But the Super Bowl champs won’t have a chance to repeat if Stafford misses serious time with an injury. “I felt like I could make any throw I wanted to, but I’m just trying to be smart,” Stafford said Saturday. We don’t know and Stafford probably doesn’t know for sure if it’s going to be an issue, but it bears watching. Closely.

3. I think this is in the category of “contract squabbles I do not understand.” Kareem Hunt, Cleveland running back, is partially holding-in—the new term for being in camp but not practicing because he wants a new contract. Hunt was practicing in some drills and not others during the week, and he was reportedly back in all drills Sunday. He is in the last year of his contract. Due to make $6.25-million this year if he’s active all season (the deal includes per-game roster bonuses). Hunt has been a Brown for three years. He’s averaged 469 rushing yards per season as the team 1b to 1a Nick Chubb. I understand his point; he thinks he should be paid like a starting running back because he is as good as one. Hunt won a rushing title while in Kansas City. But football doesn’t work that way, particularly at running back. Backups, even excellent ones, don’t get paid like starters particularly in an era of declining running-back value.

4. I think I like the fact that some teams—the Vikings and USFL in the spring, Seattle upcoming—are bringing in Jay Glazer to talk to players about mental health. Glazer wrote a book (“Unbreakable: How I turned my depression and anxiety into motivation and you can too”) on his struggles, and teams noticed. It’s so good to see him use his platform and his struggles growing up to reach others who might be feeling the same pain and feel they can’t talk about it. Ran into him Saturday at the Vikings. Glazer’s message to players, in part: “You guys don’t just do tackling drills when you miss tackles. You always practice that. That’s proactive. Mental health is too reactive—you usually address it when the sky is falling. That’s got to change. Be proactive. You have an amazing support system sitting to your right and left. Teammates. Having a team can get us through the gray of depression and anxiety. Lean on each other. Talk to each other. Everyone I’ve opened up to about my mental health struggles, it’s only made us closer. Be there for each other. Vulnerability is true strength.”

5. I think there’s really only one thing that pockmarks Aaron Rodgers’ football legacy: the fact that he’s 7-9, with zero Super Bowl wins and zero NFC titles, in the last 11 postseasons, since quarterbacking the Packers to the Lombardi Trophy in the 2010 season. He bared his soul a bit when I asked him if it hurts to look back on how the last two seasons ended—home playoff losses to Tampa and San Francisco when the Packers had NFC home-field. “I’m hurt by all the playoff losses,” he said, then he reeled them off: “2009, [51-45 to Arizona] the way I started and finished that game. The 49er game in ’13 hurts [23-20 loss]. The loss to the Giants in ’11, we had a chance. We were so good that season. 2014 is the one that always sticks with you [28-22 overtime loss to Seattle]. When you think about the worst losses in your career, I mean both of them were in Seattle—the Fail Mary game in 2012, NFC Championship in the ’14 season. But they all stick with you, because you think about what you could’ve done better. Plays you should’ve made.”

Specifically, I asked about the third-and-11 throw with three minutes left in a 10-10 game against the Niners last January, when, from his own 28, he chose to target Adams in tight double coverage deep downfield instead of Lazard running free for the easiest throw of the night. Lazard was free at the Green Bay 46-yard line, and could have made another 10 or 15 yards, easy, after the catch.

“Of course,” Rodgers said. “You think about all those plays from all the years. Never goes away. Doesn’t mean that you dwell on them or you can’t get past them. You’re a competitor, you remember maybe the failures more than the successes. I think that’s just a part of loving to compete and hating to lose maybe more than you love to win. Doesn’t mean we’re gonna get stuck on it. The finality of this league is so difficult because of how fast it comes on. You lose a game, the next day’s a meeting and that’s the last time that group will ever be together. People are always like, ‘Super Bowl hangover’ or ‘playoff loss hangover,’ but I’ve never believed that because it’s a different team every single year. We have so many different guys now. Guys that we brought in from other teams. We drafted a bunch of guys. A bunch of guys are gone. It’s a new team. We gotta figure out how to win with this team and hopefully get over the hump this year.

6. I think I loved what Dick Vermeil said in his Hall of Fame speech Saturday. “If Mike Jones doesn’t make that tackle at the end of Super Bowl 34, I’m not standing here. I will forever be indebted to all of you people,” Vermeil said. That is so true. Players making plays lead to coaches being in the Hall, and Vermeil recognized it on the biggest day of his career.

7. I think Rick Gosselin is one of the people I admire most in my business—honest to a fault, full of love for football history, so authoritative on all things football. He and the late Paul Zimmerman are the two Hall of Fame voters I respect the most over my 30 years on the selection committee. He has launched rickgosselin.com, and I’ll be bookmarking it. His all-time annual special-teams rankings are one staple of the site, along with think pieces we’re better for having read. Such this one on the rush to enshrine quantity of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

8. I think I often call Gosselin the conscience of the Hall voting panel, and this story encapsulates why. He wonders about numbers playing an outsized role in Hall enshrinement. Five receivers with at least 1,000 catches—Reggie Wayne, Andre Johnson, Steve Smith, Anquan Boldin and Hines Ward, “seemingly waiting their turn for gold jackets.” Gosselin raises the cases of three all-decade receivers from the sixties: Gary Collins, Boyd Dowler, Del Shofner. He makes a point I hope I live by on the committee: Judge players in large part against those in the era in which they played. Writes Gosselin:

“Quantity” of catch is king for receivers now. But “quality” of catch was king for receivers in the 1960s — what did you do with the football after you caught it?

Dowler caught 474 career passes, Shofner 349, Collins 330 and none amassed more than 7,300 career yards with those receptions. So there is no comparison quantity-wise with Boldin, Johnson, Smith, Ward and Wayne. But there also is no comparison in the quality of catch — and those numbers all slant in favor of the pass catchers from the 1960s.

Shofner averaged 18.5 yards per catch, Collins 16.0 yards and Dowler 15.3. Smith averaged 14.3 yards per catch, Johnson and Wayne 13.4, Boldin 12.8 and Ward 12.1. Collins caught 70 career touchdown passes. So did Johnson. But it took Collins 66 fewer games for his 70 than it took Johnson. Collins scored a touchdown every 4.7 catches, Johnson every 15.1 catches. Shofner scored a TD every 6.8 catches, Boldin every 13.1 catches.

Do Boldin, Johnson, Smith, Ward and Wayne deserve discussion for the Hall of Fame? Without question, yes. But so did Collins, Dowler and Shofner…and they never got it. Players should neither be rewarded nor punished for playing in the eras that they did.

9. I think I feel pretty confident about this preseason opinion: Kyle Trask will play the most snaps of any quarterback on the Bucs. Tampa wants to see what it has in the second-year second-rounder, and there’s no time like meaningless August games to do so.

10. I think these are my other thoughts of the week:

a. Column of the Week: Dylan Hernandez of the Los Angeles Times with an emotional beauty on his relationship with Vin Scully. This brought tears to my eyes.

b. Wrote Hernandez, who covered the Dodgers in the late stages of Scully’s play-by-play career:

The first time I spoke to him was in 2007 shortly after The Times hired me to cover the Dodgers. I ran into him in the bathroom of the press box bearing his name. While I thought it would be weird to introduce myself to him there, it occurred to me that it might be weirder to not.

When I told him who I was, he said he had heard of me and started doing that Vin Scully thing where he narrated the details of a person’s life.

“You were born in Los Angeles,” he said. “Your father is from El Salvador; your mother is from Japan. I speak a few words of Japanese myself: Konnichiwa. …”

He went on and on like this. The voice I used to hear on my transistor radio was talking to me, about me. I would have been intimidated if not for his warmth. He insisted that I called him “Vin” instead of “Mr. Scully.”

c. You need to read the Vin/Mr. Scully duel between the kid and the legend. I shan’t spoil it here. It’s beautiful.

d. How great is it to understand that a person at the absolute top of his profession is also a very, very good person? Rest in peace, Vin Scully.

e. I find it wholly sad and really amazing that the Royals dumped former favorite son and friend-of-Mahomes Whit Merrifield to Toronto at the trading deadline. (Great trade, Toronto.) Sam McDowell of the Kansas City Star encapsulated it well.

f. First, the irony of going to Toronto. Merrifield was one of 10 Royals who had to skip a road series at Toronto in July because they were unvaccinated, and he said of getting the vax, “That might change down the road” if he got traded to a team in Canada or a team that could play in Toronto in the postseason. In other words: The games I play for the Royals in Canada aren’t important enough because our team is a loser. It did not go over well. The fans’ favorite player got booed in his next game in KC. Not to over-baseball you, but that was a stunner to me.

g. The trading deadline was fun…except for the part of Christian Vazquez, longest-tenured Sox guy, going to the ‘Stros. I’ll miss the dedication and effort and overall ethos of Vazquez.

h. Beer Can of the Week: Thunder Ann American Pale Ale, from Jackalope Brewing Company, Nashville, Tenn. Look at this crazy can, with a woman in a forest with serpents (trust me).

i. Beernerdness: Doom Pedal White Ale (Fifty West Brewing, Cincinnati) was the best beer on the trip so far. The Cincinnati beer scene is outrageous, with choices out the wazoo. Drank it out of the can. The faint taste of coriander, a staple of these ales, was there, with a smooth finish and bolder than customary (for a Witbier) hoppiness. Loved it.

j. Of course, it wasn’t a trip to Green Bay without the Spotted Cow.

k. Coffeenerdness: Coffee shops are king in Minneapolis. So many good ones. Thanks to FRGMNT (not a big believer in vowels or lower-case, I guess) for being a tremendous work space Saturday and Sunday mornings…and for the terrific lattes.

l. Football Feature Story of the Week: Tyler R. Tynes of GQ (Way to go, Tyler!) with a gem on Ja’Marr Chase.

m. Chase controls what he can control. As Tynes writes, he’s big on perspective and has stressed it with his excitable Dad. Wrote Tynes:

That perspective was always there, even as a kid. Whenever Ja’Marr’s high school, Archbishop Rummel, would drop a game, his father would be “bent out of shape.” But as a teenager, Ja’Marr was a source of calm. He’d tell Jimmy, “It’s just a game, Dad.”

So, even though the Super Bowl represented the first time he’d ever lost a championship game, Ja’Marr processed the defeat quickly. He says he was over it in a few hours. “I was pissed that we lost,” Ja’Marr says. “But man, I gotta be happy I made it this far. I just made it to the Super Bowl. What can I complain about?”

n. So the interesting thing that I found in Cincinnati, by the way, is the non-devastated feeling of the team after the bummer of a Super Bowl loss. Chase illustrated why. Holy crap! We made the Super Bowl! I understand it’s not cool to just get there, but be real. Either team could have won the divisional game at Tennessee, and either team could have won the title game in Kansas City. So another one of those games in the Super Bowl and the Bengals lost? Meh.

o. I just realized I had a football thought in my non-football thoughts. Is that acceptable?

p. Happy 97th(last Wednesday), Marv Levy.

q. Now, get ready for this stunner of a birthday. I had to look at his birth year a few times and say, “Really?”

r. Happy 73rd, Brian Sipe.

s. Seventy-three!!! Did you know…In 1980, only one player (Dan Fouts) threw for more yards than Sipe’s 4,132, and only one player (Steve Bartkowski) threw for more touchdowns than Sipe’s 30.

t. I could not be happier for a verdict than for the $4.1-million Alex Jones has to pay for lying, lying, lying, lying about what happened in Sandy Hook, causing the parents of the dead to undergo even more mental torture because of the threats from sheeple following Jones.

u. Radio Story of the Week: Terry Gross, of NPR’s Fresh Air, on the documentary “Afghanistan Undercover,” secretly filed by filmmaker Ramita Navai on the perils for women in Afghanistan.

v. Per Terry Gross:

The documentary was filmed outside the capital Kabul, in Afghanistan’s provinces, where the crackdown on women’s rights has been particularly harsh. Since coming into power, the Taliban have broken their promise to allow girls to continue their schooling beyond sixth grade. With a few exceptions, women are no longer allowed to work. When out in the street, they are expected to be covered from head to toe with only an opening for their eyes. Many girls and women are disappearing — arrested for violating the morality code or abducted and forced to marry one of the Taliban.”

[Said Navai:] “What’s happening is that the Taliban are abducting women and girls and taking them without the family’s consent, without a bride price. And what usually happens, the pattern that usually follows, is that a Taliban fighter or even a Taliban commander — because we uncovered evidence that this was happening at high levels within the Taliban — will see or hear of a woman they want to marry. A lot of times it’s because there’s a really pretty, attractive young woman or girl that they’ve heard about or they’ve seen at the market, and they approach the family and they try the official route first — ask for a hand in marriage. When the family says no, that’s when they abduct the girl … Every single case that I came across, family members were beaten when the girls were taken.”

w. We’ve got a stake, justifiably, in helping Ukraine defend itself. But I wish we’d pay more attention to Afghanistan.

x. Welcome to Team NBC, Matthew Berry. Nice to have the greatest fantasy football authority ever onboard.

I’ve revised the column with some thoughts on where this story stands as of 9:30 a.m. ET today.

LATROBE, Pa. — Mike Tomlin was back with the punters Saturday afternoon. When you ask those who’ve been around him for years, you always hear, Tomlin coaches the whole team. In the middle of Saturday’s training-camp practice, his focus was incumbent punter Pressley Harvin III and Cameron Nizialek.

“Let’s go!” Tomlin yelled with Harvin poised to boot. “For us, 5.0’s the standard!”

He meant a 5.0-second hang time, which would be exemplary; the average hang time for the league’s top 10 punters in 2021, per Pro Football Focus, was 4.27 seconds. Maybe the standard is 5.0, or maybe that’s the dream. Whatever, Tomlin boomed it out, and Harvin responded with a Ray Guy-like rainmaker down the right side. Great punt.

“The standard!” Tomlin said. “Five point oh!”

Nizialek’s turn. He’s not likely to beat out the vaunted Harvin, the 2021 seventh-round draft pick, but he’s competing. Nizialek took the snap and duck-hooked the punt low down the left sideline, out of bounds. “Ooooooooh,” the crowd responded. Yikes. Not going to make this team, or any one, punting like that.

Tomlin didn’t say anything (at least that I heard). The drill went on. Why is it important? Harvin and Nizialek know it’s a big deal when the head coach takes 12 to 15 minutes to focus entirely on the punters among the 90 players in camp. This isn’t just a July drill to Tomlin. He wants to know what happens when the pressure is on. If you shank one in Latrobe with all the fans loving on you in July, how will you perform with the bright lights on you in Baltimore in a very big game? In this one moment, Harvin passed the test and Nizialek didn’t. So Tomlin could chalk up some mental evidence in one small roster battle.

Tomlin’s usually good theater at this time of year, but I was especially focused on him Saturday because of what’s at stake. With two of the organization’s most important people, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and GM Kevin Colbert, retired since the Steelers last suited up, this is a year of change, a year of what’s-next for one of the league’s top franchises with only one immovable force remaining—Tomlin, entering his 16th year as coach.

In his first 15 years as head man, Tomlin’s never had a losing season, a remarkable run of competitiveness in the dog-eat-dog NFL. (For comparison, Bill Belichick had five losing years in his first 15 as a coach.)

Tomlin didn’t like my post-practice line of questioning about what has been lost here, at one point asking, “You’re hoping that we’re mediocre?” I said no—but this is a year that people look at the Steelers and have no idea what to expect.

I could feel the heat from behind his sunglasses.

“Bring it on,” Tomlin said. “Bring it on.”

“You like that?” I said.

“Bring … it … on. Quote me.”

I think Mike Tomlin loves this setup. Just loves it.

As the calendar turns to August, the pads will go on in camps this week and real football gets closer. But all news will be eclipsed early in the week, and probably longer, by news this morning of a decision in the Deshaun Watson case. Multiple reporters said shortly before 9 a.m. that arbitrator Sue L. Robinson will rule today that Watson would be suspended for six games, would not be fined, and would not be allowed to seek massage therapy outside the auspices of the Browns.

A few thoughts about Watson, and then I’ll take the temperature of the Patriots, Giants and Steelers as I head west and south on my training camp trip.

The decision by Robinson is surprising in its leniency but not stunning. I wrote Sunday night, before the ruling came down: A win for the franchise, I believe, would be a suspension of 10 games or less. I’d be surprised if the league would accept without appeal a suspension of six games or less. I’d thought Robinson, in her first case hearing a league discipline issue, would want to try to be fair to both sides.

The NFL will not consider this fair, and I expect the league to appeal Robinson’s ruling. Of course, the way the appeals process is set up, commissioner Roger Goodell or his designee would hear the appeal, so it’s obviously arranged to go the way the league wants. As Tom Pelissero explained on NFL Network this morning, if the league increased the Watson suspension, the union could sue the league in federal court to try to overturn the league’s decision. So, assuming the league appeals, this story could stretch deep into August, and perhaps beyond.

The NFL Players Association issued a statement Sunday night saying it would abide by the ruling of Robinson—appointed jointly by the league and the union—and called on the NFL to do the same. Under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, after the arbitrator rules in discipline cases either the league or the union can appeal. Now the league has three days to decide whether to appeal.

One thing that will dominate the news in the next day or two is Robinson’s interpretation of the 24 women who came forward and accused Watson of sexual impropriety, and what exactly Watson did. Per Pelissero, Robinson concluded that the pattern of behavior by Watson was egregious, but she called it non-violent sexual conduct. Technically that may be correct, but it feels like Robinson is minimizing what happened in these cases. Watson was accused of exposing oneself to multiple women, and making sexual contact with woman who said they did not want to be touched by Watson’s penis. Pelissero said the league tried to settle with Watson and the union in recent days, but would not go below a 12-game suspension in settlement talks. The union, clearly, wanted to take its chances with Robinson. For now, the Browns and Watson have to be happy that, if this ruling stands, he’ll be eligible to play 11 of 17 games this season. But that’s a pretty big “if.”

The Lead: Steelers

My story in Latrobe begins with a Benedictine monk.

Father Paul Taylor, the president of St. Vincent College, watched practice from the sidelines Saturday in his flowing brown robe. Father Paul is also the Steelers’ team chaplain and priest, and says mass for any players, coaches or staff who wish to attend every Sunday morning. He knows Tomlin well.

“What makes him a great leader is he rises above the fray,” Father Paul told me at practice. “He knows what’s important in his job. And he’s such a good communicator. I think he can see inside the players’ heads.”

Two players told me Tomlin has a good rapport with the players because he’s blunt with them and never hides the truth. That’s important this year, because obviously the major story in camp is life without Roethlisberger, and choosing a successor. A former quarterback here, Charlie Batch, told me as we watched the QB battle play out in front of us: “I think Mike will be totally honest in the team meetings. He’ll tell the team: We have a quarterback battle here. Everyone will get a chance, and the film will speak for itself. Three dogs, one bone. Let’s see what these guys can do. Let’s see who wins the job.”

So the monk and the former quarterback point to communication and honesty about the process of retooling the team. When I relayed the Batch theory about how he’d handle the quarterback battle with the team, Tomlin said it was spot on.

“That’s very accurate,” Tomlin said. “I’m going to talk about the elephant in the room. Our ability to put together a winning formula that allows us to go into stadiums and step out with victory is what it’s about. We’re going through a transition at that position so our formula is going to change to a degree. Our strengths may change, what we lean on, what we work to minimize. That’s just team building. It requires discussion and direction. And [Batch] is right.

“I don’t run from that. I run to that.”

“What’s the newness like? When you’re dealing with some new and important people?”

“I don’t really seek the comfort of a veteran group,” Tomlin said. “I approach building a team the same every year. That’s how I’m wired. I understand the question, but it’s just not my style.”

That’s what I’d want out of my head coach. Roethlisberger’s gone. Okay. Who’s up? And will we throw it 60 percent or run it to hide whatever zits we have in the passing game? Can Najee Harris handle a 300-carry load if need be? Those are the things Tomlin tries to figure out this year—but they’re the things, at different positions, he’s tried to figure out every year.

It’s too early to draw any conclusions on the quarterbacks six weeks from opening day. But there was one major clue about how it’s trending on Saturday: In an early passing period of practice, in the tight red zone, the reps were split 4-2-1, Trubisky-Rudolph-Pickett. From what I gleaned, the opening-day assignment, Steelers at the Super Bowl Bengals, is Trubisky’s to lose.

Of course, things like this period factor into the ultimate decision. Trubisky was one of four, and Pickett nailed his one chance with a perfect touch throw for a touchdown to free-agent wideout Tyler Vaughns. “We’re at the very early stages of this. Everyone’s gonna get an opportunity to show their capabilities, for sure,” Tomlin said. As it should be.

“Coach Tomlin is very transparent about the situation,” Trubisky said. “Ever since I got here, it’s been really impressive to me how he leads the team as a football coach. He’ll even tell you. It’s not an accident that he gets the results he does because he’s such a great leader. I’m just trying to soak in all that knowledge so I can be the best player I can be and we can continue to go out and win games for the Steelers.”

The quarterback position will get the attention. The run defense might be more important. Last year, the Steelers had the worst run defense in the league, and there’s no way they’ll contend this year without fixing that. The retirement of a good two-way lineman, Stephon Tuitt, hurts. And surrendering 5.0 yards per rush is so incredibly un-Steelers-like. Both T.J. Watt and Cam Heyward said that was job one in camp this year—be sure that gets fixed. This is the highest-paid defense in the league, collectively, and they’re relying on a couple of rugged mid-level free-agents, defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi and linebacker Myles Jack, to defend the run significantly better this year.

I think a huge part of this team’s fate relies on something boring: field-position football and clock management. Harvin, the booming punter, has to be better than his 42.6-yard average last year (26th in the league). Pin teams back, play clockball, defend the run lots better, run it for 4.4 yards a clip and keep Najee Harris upright. Those things are vital to making it 16 straight non-losing seasons for Tomlin.

NY Giants Camp 10

Friday: History repeats with the Giants

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — On Feb. 14, 1979, the Giants named Dolphins director of pro scouting George Young the team’s general manager. Young picked another outsider, San Diego offensive coordinator Ray Perkins as head coach. The two imports were hired to revive a moribund franchise.

“It’s a sign the Giants are conforming with the rest of the league,” president and co-owner Wellington Mara said upon hiring Young.

History is repeating itself, almost eerily, for the Giants. For the first time since that February day 43 years ago, the Giants have gone outside the organization for both GM and coach. GM Joe Schoen came from Buffalo and he hired Buffalo offensive coordinator Brian Daboll as coach.

“We need to make some changes in how we do things around here. That was one of the big reasons why we wanted to bring somebody in from the outside,” president and co-owner John Mara said when he hired Schoen.

Like father, like son. Schoen’s mom was four months pregnant with him the last time the Giants went outside the organization for the twin hires. Daboll was 3.

“Wow,” Schoen said when I gave him the history lesson. “That’s crazy. The way this league is today, I don’t think you see that happen again.”

Since the Giants won the Super Bowl 10 years ago, they have won neither the division nor a playoff game, and they’ve averaged six wins a season … with five head coaches. Hiring Young spurred the Giants to a long era of success, including two Super Bowls in the next 12 seasons. Wellington’s son would take that, particularly with the long slog the Giants have been through since stunning the Patriots in Super Bowl 46 a decade ago.

Viewing camp practice Friday—John Mara watched alone on the sideline, the way his father did religiously for years—I thought a couple of things: All 90 of these players, from quarterback Daniel Jones and running back Saquon Barkley on down, are on trial with two new bosses. Of course there are a few, like franchise safety Xavier McKinney and twin tackles Andrew Thomas and Evan Neal, who border on cornerstones, but this might be the most fungible roster of any in the league—and it could be the one that changes the most in the next two years.

Secondly, this offense looks way behind the D early. As the Rolling Stones’ “Paint It Black” aptly boomed through speakers in mid-practice, there were two botched shotgun snaps to the quarterback, a dropped swing pass by Barkley, and Jones throwing a pick-six to cornerback Darnay Holmes. Man, was that ugly. And it didn’t get better before the end of practice. The offense truly painted it black Friday.

One practice in July is one small piece of the jigsaw puzzle for Schoen and Daboll. One of the reasons Mara picked Schoen is that he’s been part of three teams—Miami, Carolina and Buffalo—that went from moribund to the playoffs in short order. “I have faith we’ll get this turned around, but it’s not going to happen overnight,” said Schoen, 43, who looks like a slimmer version of Steve Garvey, well-coiffed and well-dressed, sitting in the Giants’ cafeteria Friday morning before practice. ”I’ve seen how to build teams the right way three or four times, and we’re going to build depth and talent with a steady plan in place.”

Already around the building you hear of Daboll reaching out like none of his predecessors did. In early June, he phoned all 21 members of the media who cover the Giants every day in early July. “Looking forward to working with you,” was his message in 10- to 15-minute conversations with each one. He walks around the business side of the building, introducing himself to strangers, telling each how important everyone in the building is to winning. As one of the veterans in the building told me, “I don’t remember a coach ever telling someone selling suites how valuable he was.” That’s not going to win one play this fall, but it does make people happier in the workplace, particularly when losing has been so prevalent.

Everyone wants to know about Jones’ future, but that’s impossible to know till the games begin. If anything, the schedule gives Jones a fighting chance. Six of the first 10 games are against teams (Carolina, Chicago, Jacksonville, Seattle, Houston, Detroit) that, like the Giants, could struggle to reach .500.

Jones showed his star traits Friday at times—sprinting through the defense for one long run, combining with talented second-round pick Wan'Dale Robinson several times—but he had more bad plays than good ones. “He’s big, he’s strong, he’s athletic, he’s got good mobile skills,” Daboll said, evenly, about Jones. “There’s a lot of different things you could do with a quarterback like that. We’re still tinkering with things to make sure that what I want him to do is be vocal back to me on things that he doesn’t feel comfortable with.”

Robinson, the 5-8, 185-pound rookie receiver from Kentucky, stood out to me with his versatility and confidence; he could earn the starting slot job. “He’s a problem,“ safety McKinney told me. “Very tough to cover.” The Giants are waiting to see more from their $18-million-a-year 2021 free agent, Kenny Golladay, who’s not separating from DBs well early in camp. That signing looks like a disaster. The receiver group’s a work in progress, but Robinson is real shot in the arm for it.

Regarding Saquon Barkley, who’s missed 18 games to injury in the last two seasons, I keep thinking his future’s elsewhere. The Giants are just getting their cap right—they should be in the top seven in cap space next offseason—and I doubt they want to spend more than $12-million on a running back, even if Barkley plays very well this year. Like so many players on the roster, my guess is he’s auditioning for 31 other teams as much as the Giants this fall.

One player who’s quickly become a Daboll/Schoen favorite is McKinney, a Nick Saban favorite while at Alabama. McKinney enters his third year feeling free under new coordinator Wink Martindale. The new DC loves turning his safeties loose. Good for McKinney, who didn’t blitz on a single snap with the former staff last season. That will change, as will his workload. Martindale, in a rarity, gave the green dot to a safety instead of the customary linebacker. The green dot is worn on the back of one defender’s helmet, and Martindale calls the defense into that player’s helmet before each snap. “An honor,” McKinney told me. “That shows the coaches trust me.”

I asked McKinney about the new regime. “We faced so much adversity the past two years. For us, it’s like can’t get any worse,” McKinney said. “We’ve touched the bottom. We’ve seen the bottom. We can only go up. The energy is a lot different in the building. You really feel that team bonding as far as from player to coach, coach to player, staff to coach. We finally feel that family atmosphere we’ve been wanting for a long time.”

Sounds great at the dawn of training camp. But the job this summer and fall is for Schoen and Daboll to begin building a solid base—with the tackles, with Kayvon Thibodeaux and McKinney keying a young defense. With or without Jones. The pain’s not over yet, but no one expected it to be in year one. Patience, Giants fans.

Patriots Camp

Thursday: As Mac goes …

FOXBORO, Mass.—Ten thoughts on the Patriots, three years Post-Tom:

1. It’s now clear that when the Patriots drafted Michael McCorkle Jones in the first round last year, they drafted a player with the ethos of Tom Brady, in all ways. (Well, maybe except for the food.) I met with Mac Jones for 10 minutes after practice, and he was respectful and congenial, but my thought as he answered my questions was, He really wants to get this done so he can go back to football. It’s no coincidence Jones, 22 years younger than his predecessor, studied Brady’s mechanics as a young quarterback, and imitated his tireless work ways. “I always watch people that are good at what they do, whatever it is. If you’re a really good, whatever, pilot, let’s find out what the really good pilots do. That’s my thing. I always try to be a sponge and learn from whoever I can.”

In the practice I watched, with Jones, there was no wasted movements. His mechanics were precise, his confidence obvious. No kidding around. He said in a radio interview last year as a 22-year-old rookie that he went to bed every night at 8:30, which some took as nerdy or a humble-brag. It was neither. He just wanted to be at his best when it was time to do the job the next day. Even in a day when the hung-over quarterback is passe, his dedication seemed—and seems—so Brady-like, so made for a Bill Belichick quarterback.

On this day, he made a perfect throw to DeVante Parker through a tiny window in the end zone but didn’t preen. His practice was businesslike. The player who once was a distant third to Jalen Hurts and Tua Tagovailoa on the Alabama depth chart walked off the field with a better grip on his team’s long-term starting job than either of the guys who once lorded over him. But he doesn’t get too hung up on the improbability of his story, or anything but today.

“I’ll reference coach [Nick] Saban here,” he told me. “But if I ever listened to the internet, I would’ve stopped playing a long time ago. You’re always gonna get people who say that you’re not good enough to do something. I still have so much to prove. I’m always trying to be better than I was yesterday and be better than myself, really. I just try to compete against myself. I know when it’s a good day. I know when it’s a bad day. It’s more about the routine. What did I do before practice to put myself in position? Can I keep it consistent? Can I do it every day? [I] persevere and work each day. That’s all you can do.”

It’s interesting to see a young player take over as unquestioned leader of the team. The ageless vets, Matthew Slater and Devin McCourty, see it happening and like it. Said McCoutry: “He has all of those things we want our quarterback to have. With a year under his belt, he’s a little bit more confident. He has a little bit more command. I told him: ‘Whoever you were in high school, in college, that guy, bring that guy here. You don’t have to be this guy or have to be that guy. We just need you to be Mac Jones. That’s what we’re seeing.”

2. The 70-year-old Bill Belichick looks and coaches a lot like the early-New England Bill Belichick. A couple of months ago, I saw a photo of George Halas coaching in his seventies (he was 21-18-3 in three seasons after turning 70) and he looked 80. Belichick looks 55. Belichick was hands-on coaching the quarterbacks, from what I saw. He spent play after play working with and drilling backup QB Bailey Zappe, who sure is getting a lot of snaps for a fourth-round maybe guy.

3. Big crowd here. Worshipful crowd.

4. DeVante Parker needs to be what he was in Thursday’s practice—a red-zone threat who competes physically for 50-50 balls. Parker won an end-zone duel with starting corner Jalen Mills, which fired up the fans. Parker, 6-3 and 220, needs to play that big in an offense with meh wideouts.

5. Regarding coaching the quarterbacks and calling the offense, it looks like play-calling could land in the headset of senior football adviser/offensive line coach Matt Patricia. We’ll see how that goes. In 26 years as a football coach, Patricia has never had the title of quarterbacks coach, offensive coordinator, running backs coach, wide receivers coach or tight ends coach. Not to say it’s disqualifying, but it’ll be interesting to watch. I won’t be surprised if Belichick eventually has a significant hand in play-calling.

6. Every team should have a leader and conscience like Devin McCourty, who turns 35 in two weeks. “The game’s a grind, and for us, it has to be,” he said. “We’re a team that really has to work at it. Early in camp you see it. You see the last period of practice, we’re yelling and screaming at the offense. I think that’s what it’s about. We have to continuously go after each other. We can’t have it easy. We can’t kinda be cool in a sense and have one of those cool practices. I’m sure you’ll see when you go to other teams, like they’re just getting some work in today. We’re not that. We have a lot of guys that have made plays in this league but are now trying to become consistent players. That’s the hardest thing. We have to take on that challenge and attack it.”

7. No idea who wins one of the most open position battles in football this summer, the corner spot opposite Jalen Mills. The corners all play with black mitts on each hand, to thwart them from grabbing receivers, trying to drill away holding penalties in the secondary. One contender is Malcolm Butler, wearing the oddest number for a corner I’ve seen: 4. He’ll try to make it back into Belichick’s good graces and lineup at age 32.5 after missing last year with an injury. That won’t be easy.

8. Excellent running back depth. Second-year back Rhamondre Stevenson should get the most touches, but it’s still going to be a job-share, mostly with Damien Harris. Stevenson’s a confident runner and, at 230 pounds, will need to be impactful in short-yardage.

9. Does anyone realize how great Nick Folk is? My 2021 all-pro kicker is 55-of-56 inside the 50 in the last two seasons. What an underappreciated player.

10. Josh Uche, drafted to be an impact edge player in the second round in 2020, has had such an invisible first two years (four sacks, only 414 snaps). He’ll have his chance this year, and I sense optimism that he can break out. But there’s pressure on Uche (and Belichick, who has had some poor drafts recently) to finally be a factor.

Thanks, Dom 20

Over the years—almost 13 of them—many of you might be aware that a man named Dom Bonvissuto has been the editor of my Monday column. I refer to Dom as a conscience as much as an editor, because many late Sunday nights/Monday mornings I’ve needed both.

I’m writing about Dom today because this is the last FMIA column he’ll edit. He’s taken a job with the site Outkick as a senior editor, and it’s good for him. Dom, wife Danny and son Jude live in Nashville, and Outkick is based there, and in many ways it’s a great fit for Dom—an expanded job role, more responsibility at a growing site, close to home, in his beloved Nashville.

Life is change. People better themselves all the time. We’ll continue to get the column out, on time, at Team NBC, and we’ll be good, and very good people will step in for Dom. But it’s hard when the best Monday morning editor I’ve ever had moves on.

I’ve worked with Dom for two stints since 2008, sandwiching a two-year leave to edit at NFL.com. He’s edited about 425 of these Monday pieces, first at Sports Illustrated and later at The MMQB and then NBC. By my count, figuring an average of 9,000 words a week, his bloodshot eyes have read/grammatically fixed/spellchecked approximately 3,816,000 of my words. Many of those edits happened at 3:08 a.m., when I’m not thinking too straight so he has to.

Editing a behemoth like this column isn’t often about saying, Don’t do this. It’s dumb. It’s being fast and clever and knowing what picture fits and what headline is smart. It’s really teamwork. I trusted Dom’s advice on what was the best news of the week, what belonged on top of the column. And other things. Don’t go napping on me now—almost finished, for instance. Now that’s important.

Editors are vital to the process of columns like this. I remember seeing Tom Brady in Montana, on deadline, one week after the 28-3 Super Bowl comeback, and racing through my writing that night/early morning, Brady dissecting every big play in the game. I was just trying to be cogent, trying to be understood, so we could have the column posted by the time people in all time zones woke up. At 3:37 a.m., with the last of 10,943 words filed, Dom sent this email: “We are good. Good night and damn proud to have worked on this.” That was cool to get just before conking out.

Once I closed a column on what I felt was Philadelphia’s precipitous firing of Chip Kelly. I filed this last graf: “Sad. Just very sad.” He changed it to: “Sad.” Period. He wrote me, “It’s better as Sad. Not a big fan of the repeat.” Dom was correct. Make words count.

I looked back over some threads of communication between us on Sunday nights. I found one that’s typical, from August 2015, in a week I was traveling to training camps. We communicated 89 times between 10:24 p.m. ET Sunday and 4:26 a.m. ET Monday, many of which happened while I was on a late-Sunday flight into Seattle, making little fixes and adds via wifi, till it was finished.

The 88th communication, from me: “Thanks for your diligence.”

The 89th, from Dom: “No prob. That’s the job.”

The perfect response.

“When we talked,” Dom reflected the other day, “I always said ‘we.’ We’re a team. When the column goes out, it’s our work. Sometimes I think editors and writers can work against each other, maybe take sides and not be flexible. I thought the best way to work was to be collaborative, not combative.”

Words to live by in the business of words. Miss you already, Dom.

On The LIV Story

This LIV golf story fascinates me, and so I asked the golf/football writer I know best, Mark Cannizzaro of the New York Post, to interpret what it all means. Our quick Q&A:

FMIA: I’m not against a sort of free agency in golf, but something rubs me the wrong way about these players taking sick money from the Saudis.

Cannizzaro: “I see it the way you see it except for one thing. The PGA Tour and the LPGA Tour and the Ladies European Tour are all in bed with China. Each has had tournament in China, and the human rights record in China is not better than in Saudi Arabia. So where do you draw the line? Everyone talks about Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist who the Saudi government had killed, which is fair. But there are countless stories of injustice in China. That young Chinese women’s tennis star is missing, the last I knew.”

FMIA: What’s the impact of LIV, really? Is there anything really wrong with a second tour?

Cannizzaro: “The worst thing in golf now is some of the greatest players in the game are playing on the PGA Tour, and some on the LIV. The game is being divided. It’s bad for golf. The way I see it, the PGA Tour doesn’t have a leg to stand on in banning the golfers who play in LIV events. There should be no reason why they should be suspended if they play their mandated 15 PGA events a year. It’s clear the Saudi money is pretty bottomless. They’ve gained more momentum than they thought they would. They’ve been empowered. Somehow there has to be a coexistence between the two. The PGA Tour is going to have to soften their stance.”

FMIA: Has this whole thing ruined Phil Mickelson?

Cannizzaro: “Phil is 52. He’s a year and three months removed from his remarkable win in May 2021 at the PGA Championship. His results since then, even prior to the LIV controversary, are not good. But it’s pretty clear to me that he’s been affected by it. He is the face of it, the one who taken the biggest beating. Golf is such a mental game. You have to have a peaceful mind, and it doesn’t look like he has that.”

FMIA: Tiger Woods hasn’t seemed tempted at all by the big money of the Saudis. Why?

Cannizzaro: “Well, he certainly doesn’t need the money. Legacy is a big deal to Tiger. Tiger is a big golf nerd. He is heavily aligned with the PGA Tour. He’s not going to cross the PGA.”

FMIA: Off topic a bit, but how about Tiger’s future? Post-car-accident, is it over for him?

Cannizzaro: “I believe that it’s over for Tiger to win a golf tournament again. I don’t know physically how much better he’s going get. It was remarkable that he came back to play the Masters, and it was a great accomplishment that he made the cut. The biggest indicator about his future was as soon as he figured he was able to compete, he targeted the British Open at St. Andrews. It’s his favorite course. Flat walk, won there twice, loves it. I was shocked he didn’t make the cut. A course like that is often won by golfers who know the nuances of it, and the fact he shot two bloated scores was eye-opening. At 46, he’ll get incrementally stronger. I don’t think ceremonial golf is imminent. But he might be at the stage where it’s more realistic to expect him to play all four majors, and his annual events in the Bahamas and maybe Genesis, his tournament in L.A.”

Quotes of the Week 30

I

“It’s always tough going from Hall of Famer to Hall of Famer.”

—Green Bay QB Aaron Rodgers, poking fun at Davante Adams for saying going from Rodgers to Derek Carr was like going from one Hall of Famer to another. Rodgers will be attempting to make Allen Lazard a Hall of Famer over the next year or two or three.

II

“This is Trey’s team and that’s nothing against Jimmy. We made that decision a year ago and we’re going with that and we’re not going to mess around with that anymore.”

—49ers coach Kyle Shanahan, closing the door on Jimmy Garoppolo starting for the team this year.

III

“Part of the problem in Arizona is the lack of preparation, and it all starts with the quarterback.”

—Former NFL QB Rich Gannon, the 2002 league MVP, writing for The 33rd Team, Mike Tannenbaum’s think-tank pro football site, on the Kyler Murray contract clause that calls for him to spend at least four hours a week away from the facility studying the that week’s game. The Cards announced Friday they were removing the clause from the contract because of the uproar over it.

IV

“I can’t afford to take any shortcuts—no pun intended.”

—Kyler Murray, the 5-foot-10 Arizona quarterback, saying it’s disrespectful to think he doesn’t work on the game plan away from the team facility.

V

“I’m gonna try to compete and get the starting job by any means necessary. Whatever that takes, I’m gonna do.”

—Matt Corral, the third-string Carolina rookie quarterback, who will have to, by any means necessary, beat out Sam Darnold and Baker Mayfield.

Seems unlikely.

VI

“To me there’s common sense and we lack it now in this country. Highland Park, Uvalde, Greenwood, Buffalo. When does it end? When do our elected officials actually do something instead of [playing] their own political game? I’m not anti-gun. But I’m anti-military-style weapons. It blows my mind that an 18-year-old kid can walk in and buy an [AR] 15.”

—Colts GM Chris Ballard.

Voices

This will be a regular part of the column during this year. Each week, I’ll take a part of my conversation with a player or person in the league about some non-X-and-O topic.

Quarterback Josh Allen, Buffalo

On his community’s recovery from the mass shooting at a Buffalo grocery store

“Coach [Sean] McDermott said to us, ‘Raise a hand if anybody wants to go out there and show support.’ There was not a single hand down. Everybody on our team that was at OTAs you saw there. Stefon Diggs flew in that day just to be there, to show his support for the community.

“It’s something that still just feels very, very wrong. Feels very weird. But, to have and share that experience, show our support for the community, we’ve got to continue to find ways to not let it just be like a one-off thing. We want to continue to show that we support this community from all of Western New York. I think what brought the community closer together, we had Micah Hyde’s charity softball game the next day to help. Again, it’s still … within the locker room, it’s still tough. I know in the community it’s still tough. We’re still talking about ways we can help.”

Numbers Game 40

Sobering numbers on the Julio Jones signing in Tampa Bay:

• In his six prime seasons, 2014 to 2019, Jones missed four of 96 regular-season games. He averaged 104 catches and 1,565 yards per season.

• In his last two seasons, 2020 and 2021, Jones missed 14 of 33 regular-season games. He averaged 41 catches and 431 yards per season.

One more sobering metric:

• In those six prime seasons, Jones played at least 75 percent of the Falcons’ snaps each year.

• In the last two seasons, Jones played 38.9 percent of his teams’ offensive snaps.

In other words, manage your expectations, Bucs fans.

Factoidness

I

The Patriots’ fourth-round quarterback, Bailey Zappe, is number 55 in camp. The second-round wideout, Tyquan Thornton, is 51. What gives with the numbers? And how weird was it to see Zappe take most of the second-team snaps the other day while wearing a linebacker number?

It’s a Belichickism. In 2018, he started giving draft picks numbers in the fifties. A few years before that, he took numbers off all draft picks in the spring, and the league forced the Patriots by 2016 to put numbers on them in at least the third phase of off-season practices. I presumed the number thing was to promote the anonymity of the you-ain’t-done-nothing-yet rookie crop, but ESPN’s Mike Reiss promoted another theory: that it forced players to communicate more on the field without the benefit of numbers. Maybe it was that. Or maybe having a quarterback wear 55 was Belichick nose-thumbing at the league.

This year, the top eight Pats’ picks (the last two, center Chasen Hines and tackle Andrew Stueber are 63 and 69, which I’ll explain), got these numbers:

50: First-round G Cole Strange

51: Thornton

52: Third-round DB marcus jones

53: Fourth-round DB Jack Jones

54: Fourth-round RB Pierre Strong

55: Zappe

56: Not issued. Belonged to Hall of Fame LB Andre Tippett

57: Not issued. Belonged to Patriots Hall of Famer Steve Nelson.

58: Sixth-round RB Kevin Harris

59: Sixth-round DT Sam Roberts

With no fifty-something numbers left, the last two picks, Hines and Stueber, got customary numbers in the sixties. Just because.

II

Thursday will mark 22 months since the last touchdown scored by Kenny Golladay, who is paid an average of $1,058,823 per game to score them for the Giants.

Since Oct. 5, 2020, here are the touchdown totals for two former NFC North neighbors: Davante Adams 27, Kenny Golladay 0.

King of the Road 50

Three highlights from life on the road with NBC Sports producers/videographers Kelsey Bartels and Morgan Miller in the past few days:

FOXBORO, Mass. — Robert Kraft give Elton John a game ball on the occasion of his final Massachusetts concert ever Thursday night in Gillette Stadium. The bottom of the ball has “7-4-76 to 7-28-22,” which amazingly means 46 years between Sir Elton’s first and last concerts in Foxboro.

One of the 90,000 in attendance at the July 4, 1976 (our Bicentennial) show at old Foxboro Stadium: Peter King, 19, of Enfield, Conn. I camped out with buddies the night before to get the best seats at the concert, which had festival seating. Highlight of the show: Elton, dressed as the Statue of Liberty, brought Billie Jean King on stage to sing “Philadelphia Freedom.” I told Kraft on Thursday afternoon, and he said, “You should come tonight!” You know, I probably should have. But duty called. At the Yard Goats.

HARTFORD, Conn. — Stayed three innings at Dunkin’ Donuts Park in downtown Hartford to see the local Yard Goats (Double-A team of the Rockies) play the Portland (Maine) Sea Dogs. Man, 6,467 people in this former ghost of a downtown was so great to see. Love to see the vitality in the area, as well as the cool things in the stadium. Three goats in a center-field pen (I got to meet the big black one, “Fancy Pants”). The Yard Goats honored a disabled American veteran between innings; he got a big hand from the crowd, and I’m sure a big part of his evening was having his photo taken with the Dunkin’ Mango Cold Brew Cup mascot. Rich Hill pitched for the Sea Dogs on Red Sox rehab. The ushers wore shirts with GOAT HERDER on the back. Two guys from Enfield sat next to me. Quite a night.

LATROBE, Pa. — Watch this video to the end. It says quite a bit about the fervor of Steeler fans on the first Saturday morning of training camp at St. Vincent College, an hour east of Pittsburgh.

Good advice. From Jeff Haraldson: “Don’t leave Josh Allen hanging with the handshake! Shake his hand!”

Well, Jeff, you’ve got company. As of 6 p.m. Friday, 1 million people had seen me stiff Josh Allen eight days ago at Bills’ camp.

You know you’re a big-time writer when you can leave the best QB in the league hanging. 😂 @JoshAllenQB @peter_king pic.twitter.com/mycT04Zlsv — Chris Simms (@CSimmsQB) July 25, 2022

Rich Eisen had some fun with me on his show, and, at Giants camp, Daniel Jones said: “Saw your shake with Josh Allen.” So … at the end of each one of these camp interviews, I face the camera and say something like, “At Bills camp with Josh Allen, this is Peter King.” Which is what I did in that case, and never saw Allen’s outstretched hand. So when I did, I felt like an idiot, and good for me, Allen chortled about it and asked my camera person, Kelsey Bartels, “Did you get that?” Glad he was a good sport. And that, as Paul Harvey used to say, is the rest of the story.

Susan’s got a point. From Susan Rowell: “So you said this last week about Lamar Jackson: ‘After Jackson’s injury-plagued 2021 season, I remain bugged by his postseason play. He’s 1-3 in four playoff games, with toothless losses to the Chargers (2018 season) and Titans (2019) at home. Do you want to lock in Jackson at $46 million a year, or whatever? … I don’t.’ But you said this week about Kyler Murray, who in one playoff appearance has a 40.9 rating: ‘In Murray’s first three seasons, the Cardinals have gone 24-24-1 in the regular season, and 0-1 in the playoffs. In the NFL, you’ve got no chance without a quarterback. Murray’s not a top-five quarterback, but he does give the Cardinals a good chance to win every game he starts. That makes him worth stratospheric money.’ So Lamar, who was 39-12 in the same period, has to have his worth judged, but Murray is worth the money? That doesn’t make sense to me.”

Very good point, Susan. I could counter by saying that Murray was drafted by a 3-13 team and led it to the playoffs in his third season, that he was going to be a major holdout threat (and into the season, I’d guess) without a new contract because he wasn’t going to play this year for $5.8 million. Jackson has made no such threats, and it doesn’t seem like he has to have a new contract or won’t play the year. Regarding the playoff thing, if Jackson only had the bad playoff game against the Chargers—Baltimore was down 23-3 after 51 minutes and lost 23-17 in 2018—I’d dismiss it. But he’s had four. It does bug me. My gut feeling is he’ll be a good playoff QB in his career, but I would like to see him be like Mahomes in January, even once, before paying him more than Mahomes.

I shouldn’t have dissed Orlando Brown. From Logan Ulrich: “I was disappointed how you characterized Chiefs left tackle Orlando Brown. You know as well as anyone that [contracts] are rarely what they seem to be on the surface … $44 million of the $139 million [deal he turned down] was in the final year of the deal. Odds are that’s money he’ll never see. What’s left is five years and $95 million, $19 million a year which is right in line with the top of the right tackle market and inside the top five at left tackle. I think it’s fair to discuss whether Brown’s gamble on himself is wise and the risk-reward proposition of turning down that offer from the Chiefs, but lumping that situation even remotely near the radioactivity of the Deshaun Watson contract just doesn’t sit well with me.”

That’s fair, Logan. Thanks for pointing it out. But I would add this: The highest paid tackles in football right now are Trent Williams and David Bakhtiari. If you take the last year of Williams’ contract off his six-year deal, it would average $21 million a year. If you take the last year of Bakhtiari’s off the deal, his would average $17.7 million. Paying Brown $19 million a year (knocking off the last year of the contract, as you justifiably say) after he was the league’s 19th-rated tackle among starting tackles last year is beyond fair, in my opinion.

The Gammons paragraph. From Michael Guncheon: “What you pick and choose to include in your column is impressive to me. I don’t get emotional that often, but I would say that your column often brings my emotion to the front. And it isn’t necessarily the obvious. Your paragraph on Peter Gammons, for whatever reason, brought tears to my eyes. It’s not saving the world, but it is keeping my hope for humanity going.”

Thanks a lot, Michael. I think I’m not the only person in the business whose career has been influenced by Gammons. I owe him a lot.

10 Things I Think I Think

1. I think it won’t be a national holiday (not yet, anyway), but you may hear a thing or two about Tom Brady turning 45 on Wednesday. A few notable things to me about the birthday and its significance in NFL history, even though I sincerely doubt Brady, who will be trying to break in a new center after the camp injury to Ryan Jensen last week, will be interested:

a. Brady, per Alex Stern of the Elias Sports Bureau, would be the ninth player to play an NFL game after his 45th birthday. Five are exclusively kickers (Ben Agajanian, Adam Vinatieri, Morten Andersen, Gary Anderson and John Carney). A lineman named John Nesser played two games for the Columbus Panhandles in 1921, while end Bobby Marshall played three games for the Duluth Kelleys in 1925.

b. You read that right: Brady, assuming he lines up to play Dallas in Week 1, would be the first non-kicker at 45 or older to play an NFL game in 97 years.

c. Blanda is the only quarterback to throw a pass after age 45. He completed 7 of 22 after turning 45, though those were mostly mop-up throws, with no quarterback starts, as he wound up his career mostly as a kicker for the Raiders.

d. I doubt Brady’s going to break this mark, but you never know: The oldest player to ever throw an NFL pass was Blanda, on Dec. 21, 1975, at 48 years and 95 days old, per Pro Football Reference. John Madden got Blanda some snaps in the last game of the regular season—Oakland 28, KC 20—at the Oakland Coliseum. Blanda threw a pick to Willie Lanier and completed one of three passes.

e. In other words, a starting quarterback for a Super Bowl contender playing at 45 is without precedent.

2. I think the Deebo Samuel extension (three years, $71.6 million, announced Sunday night) is a nice compromise and rids the Niners of a headache that would have plagued them in September. I like how it was handled. GM John Lynch refused to make any grandiose statements about Samuel when he said he wanted to be traded, and he never got emotional about it. Lynch didn’t know at the time whether Samuel would drive an impossible bargain, or come back to the table to try to get something done. When Lynch made it clear he wouldn’t trade Samuel and then just put the story on simmer for two months, that gave all parties time to reset and cool off. Nice job getting Samuel back, and good for Samuel to cash in after one great season.

3. I think you’re probably seeing some pictures out of training camps with players (linemen, tight ends and linebackers mostly) wearing Guardian Caps, the foam helmet supplement that sits on top of helmets. The idea is to give the head an extra shock absorber when helmet-to-helmet contact occurs, or when the helmet strikes any solid surface. Several coaches, including Mike Tomlin, have been outspoken advocates of the Guardian Caps, mandated at the positions I mentioned through the week of the second preseason game in mid-August. Said Tomlin: “What convinced me is that data that said when one player wears it and hits a player who doesn’t, the impact on the head is 10 percent less. And if both players are wearing them, the impact is reduced by 20 percent.”

No one knows what the data will say after a summer of increased usage of the caps, but the NFL is hoping wearing the device will markedly decrease the number of concussions and sub-concussive hits in the summer. The league has seen an uptick in recent years of concussions in the preseason. “The brain does not acclimate to head impact,” NFL medical director Dr. Allen Sills said. “The Guardian Cap helps mitigate those forces at a time of the season when we see the greatest concentration of them.” It’s a good step. I’d like to see players wear them for every practice, in-season and out.

4. I think the life and times of Bill Russell should be celebrated not just for basketball, but for his contributions to society. As longtime basketball writer Bob Ryan pointed out after Russell’s death Sunday, Russell’s teams played in 21 winner-take-all games (in the NCAA tournament or Olympics, or the final game of an NBA playoff series) and his team was 21-0 in those games. He never averaged more than 19 points a game in his NBA career, but his Celtics teams won 11 titles in his 13 NBA seasons. That stuff won’t be repeated. His social activism is what helped him win the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. He fought hotel boycotts as an NBA player, boycotting a preseason game in Lexington, Ky., once when he and Black teammates were denied hotel rooms. He joined with Muhammad Ali and other athletes in backing Ali’s refusal to be drafted. Russell simply wouldn’t back down in the face of perceived injustice. His final public act in that arena: In 2017, at age 83, he posted a photo of himself kneeling in solidarity with NFL players. He was a model to all citizens to stand for something, and the modern athlete respected the heck out of him for it. “Rest up Bill Russell,” Saints wideout Jarvis Landry tweeted Sunday night.

5. I think, in case you’re scoring at home, my 39th training-camp trip is five sites old, with six more slated this week:

• Seen: Las Vegas, Buffalo, New England, N.Y. Giants, Pittsburgh.

• Scheduled (important word, because life is fungible) this week: Cincinnati, Tennessee, Tampa Bay, Green Bay, Chicago, Minnesota.

• Little things I noticed so far: Derek Carr’s mastery of a new offense with the Raiders, and his love of learning and commanding his team … Bills WR Gabriel Davis’ attention to his craft. His work and soft hands on the Juggs machine post-practice was noticeable … Devin McCourty’s love of football, and after the retirement of his brother, his inability to let it go in New England … The respect the Giants have for safety Xavier McKinney, and the great expectations they have for him, and how he embraces both … The juice rookie Kenny Pickett brought to the Pittsburgh crowd (huge, just huge) with an early-practice touchdown tucked into the left corner of the end zone. Mark my words: Assuming Pickett doesn’t start, the locals will beat the drum for him very early if the starter struggles.

6. I think I noticed this from the dispatch of Mary Kay Cabot of the Cleveland Plain Dealer after the Browns’ first practice of camp open to the public Saturday, on the reception given to Deshaun Watson: “Not only did no one protest, Watson was cheered as he ran out onto the practice field, and again when he left after spending about a half-hour interacting with fans.” Interesting. Not altogether surprising.

7. I think veteran jurist Sue L. Robinson is about to be a household name for the first time in a long legal life.

8. I think I do not like what this says: There was more written and discussed on NFL teams’ alternate helmets in the second half of July than there was on Daniel Snyder and Congress, Deshaun Watson, and any other news that actually means something. (And now, I’ll ask you politely to get off my lawn.)

9. I think this story has had about 16 lives in the past six days, but here’s my take on the Kyler Murray contract clause that became not a contract clause: It’s the dumbest clause I’ve ever seen in an NFL contract. Intentionally or not intentionally (and did someone inside the team actually want to embarrass Murray?), that clause calling for Murray to spend at least four hours studying the game plan in each game week was going to get out. It was too sensational to not get out. And so the result of that would be embarrassing for Murray and point out that the team was worried about whether the young quarterback was devoting enough time to his job. Imagine a clause like that for Patrick Mahomes, or Tom Brady, or Russell Wilson, or Josh Allen, all noted worker bees. They’d laugh. Because of all the darts thrown at Murray (and a few at the team), the Cardinals cut out the clause. But the damage was done to Murray’s reputation. And I can’t help wondering how long it will take to repair the relationship between him and the team.

10. I think these are my other thoughts of the week:

a. Traveling the country, I continue to be amazed at the sheer number of beers. How do all the breweries survive?

b. Waze is incredible. How is it free? “Police in 0.1 mile,” it warned on the Pennsylvania Turnpike on Friday evening, our little crew on the way to Latrobe and the Steelers. Sure enough, there was a Pennsylvania state trooper on the side of the road 10 seconds ahead.

c. Beernerdness: Reader Bjorn Anderson asked for more Beernerdness and Coffeenerdness, so I’ll keep that in mind in the coming weeks. Today’s edition: Castle Island White Ale (Castle Island Brewing, Norwood, Mass.) I’m a fan of the wheat beers/white ales, and this one was a little hoppier than most. Had a big smell and taste of coriander with a good head, though not the same smoothness of an Allagash White. New England’s become a great place for beers of all kinds, and this one, if you like the style, is a good one to sample.

d. Congrats on the weight loss, Greg Bedard. Just awesome. So happy for you.

e. Story of the Week: Michael Finnegan of the Los Angeles Times, with one of the coolest they-almost-got-away-with-it stories of the year.

f. Great dateline, and love the way Finnegan set up his tale:

TIVAT, Montenegro — The private jet banked eastward as it ascended out of Lisbon. After passing Madrid and Barcelona, it flew over the Mediterranean and the Italian peninsula — Rome on the left, Naples on the right.

The husband and wife enjoying the plush cabin with their black dog were convicted swindlers from Los Angeles on the sixth day of a daring getaway. With police worldwide on alert to arrest them, they had slipped off to Portugal and hoped to vanish in the Balkans by nightfall.

Their destination was Montenegro, a mountainous nation a few hundred miles up the Adriatic coast from Greece — an appealing alternative to prison in the United States. At sunset, the splendor of the rugged shoreline came into view as the chartered Cessna Citation VI descended into Tivat, a posh town on the stunning Bay of Kotor, framed by the steep slopes of the Dinaric Alps.

There, the couple would shed their identities as Richard Ayvazyan and Marietta Terabelian, leaders of a family fraud ring that collected $18 million in pandemic relief for sham businesses in the San Fernando Valley. It was one of the many lurid scams by grifters who lied to get rescue loans during the 2020 lockdowns.

Forged Mexican passports with photos expertly embedded would clear the couple’s way into Montenegro. Rich and Mary were adopting new names worthy of a 19th century novel: Roberto Niko De Leon and Nataly Rose Perez Garcia.

g. Is that real life, or the best beach read of the summer?

h. Such a smart way of making sure the reader gets swallowed up into the story. I found my outrage bubbling up when I realized these people had stolen $18 million from you and me, basically, to bankroll a wonderful and undeserved life … not to mention abandoning their three children as they made a getaway. Who does that?

i. Crime Story of the Week: Michael Hall of Texas Monthly with “Murders on the Lake,” about an unsolved triple-murder in Waco in 1982. (H/T from reader Conrad Roblejo.)

j. You’ll need some time to plow through it, but the investigations are compelling.

k. I disagree, “Jeopardy!” Mayim Bialik should be full-time, not in a job-share with Ken Jennings. Ken’s a nice guy, Mayim’s a natural at the gig.

l. As a Red Sox follower, I’d understand trading Xander Bogaerts at the deadline for a top prospect. But not re-signing Rafael Devers long-term? That would be unacceptable.

m. Man, the Reds got a ransom for a pretty inconsistent pitcher, Luis Castillo. They parlayed a very good year for Castillo so far (2.87 ERA, 1.07 WHIP) into a great prospect return from Seattle.

n. Would you pay a gigantic price in players and prospects for Juan Soto, plus a $38-million-a-year deal? That’s a sticker-shock sign and trade.

o. Song of the Week: The Covid/isolation video version of “Something So Strong,” by Crowded House.

p. That song’s a hidden fave of mine, and how great is the technology that allows five people in different locales to play their parts of a great song, and then look how great it sounds when it’s knitted together?

q. Radio Story of the Week: Carrie Feibel of National Public Radio, on the incredible dilemma of ill mothers and reticent doctors as the new abortion laws take effect.

r. This is an apolitical inclusion in the column, included simply for the quality of the story and the quandary we’re in as a society if we don’t figure out what to do with women whose lives are endangered carrying babies they long to bring to term but can’t. From the story:

In the medical profession, doctors will continue to grapple with the new legal restrictions, and the resultant dilemmas in obstetrical care, says Dr. Alan Peaceman. A professor of maternal-fetal medicine at Northwestern. “It’s going to take a while before … the medical community comes to some kind of consensus on where you draw this line, and where you say enough is enough. Because that doesn’t really exist right now. And if you leave it up to individuals, you’re going to get uncertainty and people unwilling to make decisions.”

s. This is not something I have to worry about, but I found it interesting: a segment on Alison Stewart’s WNYC radio show “All of It” about when kids should have smartphones. Stewart interviewed author Catherine Pearlman, who wrote “First Phone: A child’s guide to digital responsibility, safety and etiquette.” (Scroll down to the 22-minute interview late in the show.)

t. Pearlman says there’s no right age to get kids these phones. “The first thing is, ‘What’s the need?’ “ Common sense. Most kids are getting these phones between 8 and 11 now, which surprises me—seems early. But Pearlman has some good guildelines to follow, and good ideas about rules for phone use at a young age.

u. Strong third and fourth episodes of “Wesley,” the Lyman Bostock pod by Tom Rinaldi. What a life (and death) story. I’m bummed out anticipating the tragedy in Episode 5, when, presumably, the story of Bostock, one of the best players in baseball, being murdered on a 1978 road trip, is revealed.

v. Ahhhh, to be Colts owner Jim Irsay and to love and collect artifacts both famous and arcane. On Tuesday night at the AON Grand Ballroom on Navy Pier in Chicago, Irsay will debut his latest prized possession: the “Rumble in the Jungle” boxing title belt won by Muhammed Ali in his fight with George Foreman in Africa in 1974. Jim Brown, a friend of both fighters, will be Irsay’s guest at the event. And it’s free, from 7-10 p.m. All of Irsay’s collection, political and historical and sporting, will be on display.

w. This is apropos of nothing, totally. But I’ve had four people on the trail so far talk to me about the books I reviewed in early June in the Fathers Day book section. At the Giants the other day, John Mara said he read “City on Fire,” by Don Winslow, and was looking forward to Kostya Kennedy’s Jackie Robinson book. I love that. Not that people are reading the books I recommend, necessarily, but that people are reading.

x. Thanks for having me as a guest on your pod, Cam Heyward. Not sure when my episode of “Not Just Football With Cam Heyward” will be live, but he came off the practice field Saturday and sat there by the side of the field and recorded it. Good host. Curious guy. And prepared.

y. When you get to be 65, as happened with me in June, and you look at the training camp schedule, and you see: “Sunday, July 31: Writing Day,” man, it’s nice to be able to sit in a hotel in Cincinnati, navel-gaze a bit, and figure out exactly what you want to write. Squeezing in four innings of Orioles-Reds doesn’t hurt either. Great to be back in my old town.

The pupil in this 17-minute tutorial: quarterback Derek Carr. Every day—on the practice field, or in the hallways of the Raiders’ gleaming practice facility in suburban Las Vegas, anywhere they see each other—McDaniels finds a few minutes to continue the download of his offense, the Super Bowl-winning New England offense, into Carr’s head.

On this day, McDaniels is drawing up protection schemes on a white grease board, and Carr sits taking notes on his tablet. McDaniels is teaching his QB to call and maneuver all of the protections at the line of scrimmage, the way Tom Brady did. That’s part of the lesson. Discipline on double-move pass-routes is the other part. McDaniels tells Carr he doesn’t like the lax technique he saw on one of the routes at practice, so he’s decided to enlist a new coach (sort of) to help get the technique across.

Steph Curry.

“We’ve just gotta be patient on the double-move,” McDaniels said. “If we’re not patient with the first part of the route, how can we expect the second part of the route to work? So we’re gonna show that film today. The Steph Curry film.”

“Perfect,” Carr said.

“The way Curry has the patience and the discipline on his pump-fakes before taking those threes … that’s a perfect example of what I’m talking about,” McDaniels said. “In a double-move, if you don’t run the first route well first, the defender never jumps the play, right? Today we didn’t even run the first route, so the defender never budged—he knew the [receiver] was going up the field. Curry’s pump-fakes are real. They make the defenders go zooming by.”

“Flying out of bounds,” said Carr, who’d seen the tape of Curry pump-faking, waiting, then burying threes. “It’s hilarious.”

This whole session feels more like two peers talking than coach dictating to player. This is not what I recall from McDaniels’ Denver days in his first head-coaching go-round. Players found him too much of a bossman when challenged, and in today’s football, when relationships are being formed, that’s not going to work.

“Oh, I’ve learned a lot,” McDaniels said around 6:45 that evening in his office.

“Give me an example,” I said.

“I’m not Bill [Belichick], and there’s no shame in saying that. Bill’s the greatest football coach of all time, and he’s got his own distinctive way of doing things. So now, my thought process is less, ‘What would we have done in New England?’ It’s more, ‘What would I do?’ I have faith in myself as a coach. The vibe around here is one I should create. It’s not one I should mimic.”

—

Two diverse datelines as camps open around the league: HENDERSON, Nev., and PITTSFORD, N.Y. By the way, one day, try to report in the early evening in Vegas, then get to a little upstate New York hamlet for a 10 o’clock football practice the next morning. That was … interesting.

I’m going to bop back and forth between the two here, giving you my take on the Bills and their Most Important Newcomer, pass-rusher Von Miller, and then on the weight of expectations. (Is there anyone not picking the Bills to win their first Lombardi this year?) You’re going to love the raw honesty of Miller discussing the happiness of being a Bill while having a hole in his heart for leaving the Rams.

Then it’s back to Nevada, where a diving catch by Hunter Renfrow caught the admiring eye of Davante Adams and said something about the Raiders and their beaming coach. Of course, most football teams are wildly optimistic on July 25. I saw two of them up-close over the weekend.

And I’ll give you the biggest issues for all 32 teams entering training camp. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight.

The Lead: Bills Camp

PITTSFORD, N.Y.—The last nine months of Von Miller’s life:

Oct. 21: In his last game as a Denver Bronco, Miller played 33 snaps in a 17-14 loss to Cleveland.

Nov. 1: Denver traded Miller, who was stunned by it, to the Rams for second- and third-round picks in the 2022 draft. “You wanna make God laugh, make plans,” a subdued Miller said.

Jan. 2: In his seventh game for the Rams, Miller was the biggest player on the field, recording two big sacks of Tyler Huntley at Baltimore in a 20-19 win. “This is what you play the game for,” Miller said post-game, and I remember (I was there) hearing how exultant Miller and his mates were through the locker-room door. Miller loved the Rams.

Feb. 13: Six years after his Super Bowl MVP performance for Denver, Miller sacked Joe Burrow twice in the Rams’ 23-20 Super Bowl victory.

Early March: Miller, a free-agent, reportedly told friends he’d re-sign with the Rams because it’s where he wanted to finish his career.

March 16: Miller, torn between the Rams and the significantly bigger money offered by the Bills, chooses Buffalo’s six-year deal with $51-million guaranteed and worth up to $120-million. Buffalo GM Brandon Beane was both happy and surprised by the decision, because the Bills kept hearing his heart was in L.A.

July 7: In Dan Pompei’s profile of him for The Athletic, Miller says the day after he agreed with the Bills, he was having so many second thoughts on the flight to Buffalo to sign that he planned to tell them he’d changed his mind. But the Bills had such a good plan for him that, per Pompei, Miller prayed on the Bills’ home field and decided to sign with Buffalo after all.

July 24: Wearing a blue number 40 jersey, Miller jogged out to his first practice with the Bills on the St. John Fisher campus in a leafy Rochester suburb. He signed autographs for 20 minutes afterward for some of the 5,500 fans who crammed camp.

“Free-agency is crazy,” Miller told me after practice. “You gotta make life-changing decisions, career-changing decisions, in two hours.”

We live in a transactional sporting world, with players famous and unfamous changing teams day after day. When something like Miller happens, and he’s emotional about it, the reaction by some is Man up, millionaire. I’ll change cities for $100 million any day. Well, of course. But think of what Miller went through. He loved L.A., he loved his Super Bowl mates (especially Aaron Donald, as a player and person), he loved playing for Sean McVay. The Rams wanted him back, and he was happy with his moderately reduced workload (he played about 75 percent of the snaps in his 12 Rams games). But then the Bills threw the money and the love at him, and here we are.

Miller went to the Rams’ Super Bowl ring ceremony last week in California. “So hard to let go of L.A.,” he said. “So hard to let go of Coach McVay, [GM] Les Snead and especially Aaron Donald, man. Every time I think about it, man, I get sad thinking about not playing with them anymore.”

I say: Good for him for admitting it. Who can blame Miller for being human, for having a few ounces of regret for leaving a team he’d grown to love. He’s not betraying the Bills; he’s simply getting over a heartbreak. In due time, he’ll be fine, and he’ll be a Bills Mafia favorite. Emotions now, pragmatism later. But let’s be real about the opener, Bills at Rams, Sept. 8, with America watching. That’ll be a tough night for Miller.

Speaking of pragmatism, how will the Bills keep the 33-and-a-half Miller healthy and contributing for 17 weeks of the season and maybe four more in the playoffs? He can’t be an every-down player, and probably shouldn’t play even 75 percent of the snaps.

“We got Von to close games for us,” GM Brandon Beane told me.

So this seems logical to me: The Bills are so good that in games they’re leading big at the start of the fourth quarter, coach Sean McDermott should say to Miller: Take a shower. You’re done. That could save 100, 150 snaps. And for the big ones (at Baltimore, at Kansas City, Green Bay, at Cincinnati, maybe a New England or Miami game), he could give Buffalo 65 snaps. The rest of the time, let a strong rotation of youngsters get time to get better.

McDermott told me: “If I said that we don’t have to rely on him to play full games, and he reads that, he’s gonna be like, ‘Oh no. No way.’ Because that’s how competitors are. Right? I fully expect him to be able to do it if we need it.”

“Peter, it’s the first day of training camp!” Miller said when I asked him about not overdoing it this year. “I don’t want to miss that game-changing play being on the sidelines. Of course I’m gonna listen to the coaches and the GM and everyone I trust here. But I wanna play as much as possible.”

Of course. But McDermott and defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier will need to be conservationists, and adults on the sidelines. The Super Bowl favorite doesn’t need the former Super Bowl MVP to be watching in a parka in a big January playoff games.

Three Bills things:

1. Josh Allen’s a rock star, and more. The crowd was batcrap for him for two hours of practice and then a few signing binges post-practice. I got coffee in Pittsford later and I came upon this devotional candle in his image in the coffeeshop.

At practice Sunday, Bills EVP Ron Raccuia told me he was in the Bills group that went to the site of the mass grocery store shooting in Buffalo in May. He saw Allen approach city and county leaders to offer condolences. “He shook hands with the three politicians, including the mayor of Buffalo, Byron Brown,” said Raccuia. “He spent time talking and listening to each one. And he leans into [Erie County legislator] April Baskin, and I heard him say, ‘April, have you been okay through all of this?’ He meant it. He is one of the most authentic guys I’ve been around.” Athletes are important to communities. Sean McDermott brought up David Ortiz taking the mic after the Boston Marathon terrorism and saying, “This is our f—ing city!” Allen is not Ortiz—yet—but he’s becoming a very big part of the fabric of western New York.

2. Lockdown cornerback Tre’Davious White (torn ACL eight months ago today) is valuable, and is also on the Physically Unable to Perform List. No one’s predicting if he’ll be ready to face the Rams in 45 days, but the Bills will spend lots of manhours getting first-round pick Kaiir Elam ready just in case.

3. Spent some time watching wideout Gabriel Davis, who scored four touchdowns in the playoff loss to Kansas City, catch balls off the JUGS machine. He’s cut, he’s got soft hands, he’s very ready to be a 1b to 1a Stefon Diggs in this offense. He’s a worker bee too. All you fantasy players: Don’t let Davis slip too far down your receiver rankings. He’ll get his targets. Allen throws to the open guy, and Davis is good at getting open.

32 questions, 32 teams 10

The pressing issue in 32 training camps over the six weeks:

AFC East

Buffalo: Can Von Miller solve Buffalo’s only big issue?

GM Brandon Beane addressed pass-rush in the ’20 and ’21 draft with A.J. Epenesa, Greg Rousseau and Boogie Basham, but the three combined for only eight sacks last year. Now Miller comes in to turbocharge the rush from the right side. You can read more higher in the column.

Miami: Will Mike McDaniel be able to unlock Tua’s potential?

Not many teams can match the three-man firepower of Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle and Mike Gesicki, and not many teams have a better left tackle than Terron Armstead. It’s clear this is a make-or-break season for Tua Tagovailoa, and a prime reason why offensive wunderkind McDaniel was imported from the Kyle Shanahan tree. Miami’s got to be significantly better than 25th in total offense, which the ’21 Fins were.

New England: Can Bill Belichick make an iffy roster competitive?

The Patriots have made chicken salad out of chicken feathers most often in Belichick’s tenure, but this summer will really be a test of that practice. Some very iffy drafts and refusing to pay market prices for young stars like J.C. Jackson have made players like 32-year-old Malcolm Butler important rather than marginal. The Patriots need strong camps from lots of questionable players, and not just Mac Jones.

N.Y. Jets: Can the Jets get the max out of Mekhi Becton?

Interesting point made to me by estimable beat man Mark Cannizzaro of the New York Post: Coach Robert Saleh has an interesting thought on young players like supposed franchise tackle Becton, the 11th pick in ’20 draft. “He never make a determination on a player till after the third year,” Cannizzaro said. “And this is the third year for Becton.” This year’s rookie crop is strong, led by corner Sauce Gardner, but this camp is more important for Becton.

AFC North

Baltimore: Can the Ravens get back to normal after a weird year?

Few playoff contenders have more questions entering camp. Reliable receiver Marquise Brown was dealt to Arizona (in effect for rookie center Tyler Linderbaum), so replacing his 91 catches is an issue. Lamar Jackson’s contract thing hovers over the team. A jillion players returning from injury—most importantly Marcus Peters, Marlon Humphrey and J.K. Dobbins—cloud the forecast. Very big summer in Owings Mills.

Cincinnati: Will a bridge get built with Jessie Bates?

When the Bengals drafted safety Daxton Hill in the first round last April, it added more uncertainty to Bates’ situation. Hill’s four-year contract is worth $1 million less than Bates’ franchise number for this year—and Bates refuses to sign that. Bates likely will stay away from camp. Because the Bengals are likely looking to bankroll enough money to sign Joe Burrow long-term, Bates may have to choose between $12.9 million for one year or sitting out the season.

Cleveland: Do you even need to ask?

One story and one story only in Cleveland camp: Counting down the days (hours?) till arbitrator Sue L. Robinson rules on whether Deshaun Watson will be suspended (highly likely) and if so for how long. If it’s a long ban, 10 games or more, the Browns could choose to chase Jimmy Garoppolo for a one-year bridge—though their next two drafts were denuded by the trade for Watson. Or they could play Jacoby Brissett. Neither option is very good.

Pittsburgh: Who wins the Trubisky-Pickett competition?

In his 16th season as Steeler coach, Mike Tomlin will have a QB competition for the first time. Free-agent Mitchell Trubisky probably enters camp in Latrobe as a slight favorite over first-round pick Kenny Pickett from Pitt. There’s no insight to be had on this, yet. Tomlin will let the next five weeks make his decision.

AFC South

Houston: Is Davis Mills “The (Long-Term) Man?”

Before you say, “Oh, stop,” consider that Mills, in his last five games last year, had a passer rating over 100, completed 68.4 percent, and had a 9-to-2 TD-to-pick ratio. The schedule (Colts, Bears, Jags in the first five weeks) gives Mills a chance to build some momentum early.

Indianapolis: Can the defense get stingier?

Of course, the biggest acquisition in the offseason was Matt Ryan, who will be a better leader and should be a better clutch player than Carson Wentz was. But my sneaky-huge pickup for Indy was cornerback Stephon Gilmore, the 2019 Defensive Player of the Year (and soon to be 32). The Indy D gave up 32 touchdown passes and 4,203 passing yards last year.

Jacksonville: How quick can Travon Walker get up to speed?

The first pick in the draft didn’t have a first-pick-in-the-draft resume at Georgia (9.5 sacks in three seasons, zero times first- or second-team all-SEC). But GM Trent Baalke saw the freakish athleticism of Walker, and now, in camp, the world will be watching to see what Baalke saw.

Tennessee: Can Ryan Tannehill regain his mojo?

Tannehill turns 34 Wednesday, which is primetime for quarterbacks these days. But he’s on a streak of one 300-yard game in his last 16 starts, and we all saw him cough up the top-seed Titans’ first playoff game to Cincinnati in a three-pick nightmare last January. Now he’s got to be great without A.J. Brown, and with potential heir Malik Willis pressing him. Camp is very big for Tannehill and this offense.

AFC West

Denver: Will Randy Gregory and Bradley Chubb be worth the investment?

Of course this is the Summer of Russell (Wilson) in Colorado. But we all know he’ll be fine and productive. I say the bigger question mark in camp is honing a pass rush to threaten Patrick Mahomes, Derek Carr and Justin Herbert in a QB-heavy division. Gregory is coming off rotator cuff surgery in March, and Chubb, the fifth overall pick in 2018, hasn’t justified his draft stock after missing 24 games in four seasons. Big summer for them.

Kansas City: Can Mahomes make up for some holes?

Andy Reid’s not used to patching so many things in camp—though he did have to reinvent his offensive line last year. After the trade of ultimate weapon Tyreek Hill to Miami, it’ll be up to Mahomes to make the Mecole Hardman/JuJu Smith-Schuster/Marquez Valdes-Scantling/Skyy Moore combo platter work. Then there’s the burgeoning contract issue with left tackle Orlando Brown, who may not be in camp. And there’s the leadership gulf left by the departure of Tyrann Mathieu on defense. It’s rare this franchise has this many issues in camp.

Las Vegas: Can a shaky offensive line give Carr time to thrive?

Alex Leatherwood was a risky pick by ex-GM Mike Mayock, who was confident he’d develop into a standout right tackle. It didn’t work. Leatherwood led all NFL lineman last year with 65 QB pressures allowed and was moved to right guard early in the season because of it. Leatherwood’s getting another chance this summer at tackle. But in camp, Brandon Parker is getting more snaps at right tackle than Leatherwood. Will Carr have enough time to find Davante Adams downfield?

L.A. Chargers: Can a redesigned D mesh in six weeks?

The Chargers may have five new starters out of 12 on defense (counting the nickel corner): tackles Sebastian Joseph-Day and Austin Johnson, edge-rusher Khalil Mack, corner J.C. Jackson and nickel Bryce Callahan. Brandon Staley will have to see how many snaps the 31-year-old Mack can play, because, like Miller in Buffalo, Mack’s biggest value will come as a closer in big games.

NFC East

Dallas: Can Micah Parsons be cloned?

When your offenses averages four touchdowns a game over two years (Dallas is scoring at a 28-points-per-game clip since opening day 2020), and the record is only 18-16, there’s a major issue to be solved. Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn’s got to solve it. Will he use Parsons, reigning Defensive Rookie of the Year after a 13-sack season, as a puzzle piece all over the front? Can he get one more strong season out of DeMarcus Lawrence (only 14.5 sacks in his last 39 games). It’s clear Dallas needs another impact player, or three, on defense.

N.Y. Giants: Can Brian Daboll turn Daniel Jones’ career around?

John Mara, like it or not, still believes Jones can be a good starting NFL quarterback. Mara thinks the revolving coaching door and weaponry that’s always hurt has doomed Jones. This summer, Daboll, imported after tutoring Josh Allen in Buffalo, will try to put a stamp of competency on Jones—but two disappointing receivers last year, Kenny Golladay and Kadarius Toney, will be closely watched too.

Philadelphia: Will Howie Roseman’s architecture show up this summer?

All eyes will be on quarterback Jalen Hurts, and rightfully so; this is his year to prove he should be the long-term QB. But so many new additions must find niches by the end of August. Start with A.J. Brown, the new star receiver acquired on draft night, who should make beautiful music with DeVonta Smith. But look for college stars Jordan Davis and Nakobe Dean to push for snaps. Hidden gem James Bradberry could be a steal at corner. Lots of summer new from Philly ahead.

Washington: Will Carson Wentz finally find a long-term home?

Mike Florio said it right when Indy dumped Wentz after a terrible finish but a season with 27 TDs and just seven picks: Wentz needs to go to a place to prove himself from scratch. After having the easygoing Doug Pederson and father figure Frank Reich as coaches in his first six pro seasons, Wentz has to prove himself all over again in Washington, and that starts in earnest this summer.

NFC North

Chicago: Ready for massive reconstruction?

It’s good to have the quarterback of the future in-house (presumably). But major change rules the franchise, led by coach Matt Eberflus and GM Ryan Poles. Offensive coordinator Luke Getsy’s a major factor in his first year as an OC, maybe the most important of the newbies, because he’ll be charged with growing the game of the vital Fields. A good sign will be quicker decision-making by Fields, sacked on a league-high 11.7 percent of his drops last year.

Detroit: Can Aidan Hutchinson transform a listless D?

The Lions, after finishing 30th in the league in sacks last year, need to work in camp on making sure Hutchinson hits the ground running in September. There are no good alternatives for coordinator Aaron Glenn’s defense, so grooming Hutchinson is job one on a team that can’t rely on the offense to put up 25 points a game.

Green Bay: Can Rich Bisaccia awaken the sleepy special teams?

You’re surprised I didn’t have the big question being: Can Christian Watson be a serviceable replacement for Davante Adams? I just figure Aaron Rodgers will figure it out, because he usually does. The horrendous kicking game, well, that’s another matter. In the last five minutes of the divisional game against the Niners, the Packers turned a 10-3 lead into a 13-10 loss by having a punt blocked for a TD and surrendering a game-winning field goal. Bisaccia, one of the best kicking game coaches in football, is being paid (reportedly) around $2 million, a league high for special-teams coaches, to rebuild the unit.

Minnesota: Is the Kevin O’Connell/Kwesi Adofo-Mensah team what the Vikings need?

Players tired of Mike Zimmer’s negativity and the fact he couldn’t fix the defense last year. Kevin O’Connell brings more of an analytical bent to his coaching and planning, and GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah breaks rules like in-division trading because he doesn’t think there should be rules. I look for QB Kirk Cousins to be a big beneficiary this summer after feeling beaten down a bit in recent seasons.

NFC South

Atlanta: Can the Falcons not be downtrodden?

Stark headline on the Atlanta Journal Constitution website: “There’s no bright side on eve of training camp.” Well, yikes. This is a year to get the cap right, adjust to post-Matt Ryan life, and see if Marcus Mariota is worth keeping around, or if Desmond Ridder has real promise. A good goal for camp would be to see how quickly Ridder can be ready to take an early screen test.

Carolina: Who wins the QB battle?

Should be a good competition between incumbent Sam Darnold and newcomer Baker Mayfield…and I like Baker to win if he can digest the playbook in the next five weeks. Of course, the future of the head coach and his staff ride on the outcome of how the QBs play. One good facet of the competition: Rookie third-rounder Matt Corral, the Chris Simms darling, should get a needed redshirt year.

New Orleans: Will weapons out the wazoo pay off?

The last time Sean Payton wasn’t the coach of this team was 17 years ago, in 2005. Dennis Allen is the beneficiary of a good team built by GM Mickey Loomis and personnel czar Jeff Ireland, and if Jameis Winston can return strong from his ACL/MCL surgeries with a healed Michael Thomas, his receiver group is better than Drew Brees had in his latter years: Thomas, rookie Chris Olave (with star potential) and vets Jarvis Landry and Tre’Quan Smith. I believe camp will prove one thing: Do not hand the division title to the Bucs so fast.

Tampa Bay: Will the patchwork offense be good enough early?

Easy to say Tom Brady—who turns 45 Aug. 3—is the sports world’s biggest metronome, and he’ll never not be good. But let’s see how the Bucs fare after losing two of their top three tight ends (Gronk, O.J. Howard) and both starting guards (Alex Cappa, Ali Marpet)…and with the uncertainty of when favorite receiver Chris Godwin returns from his Jan. 3 ACL surgery. That’s a lot of ifs for a team with a killer first four weeks: at Dallas, at New Orleans (4-0 versus the Brady-quarterbacked Bucs in the regular season), Green Bay, Kansas City.

NFC West

Arizona: Can the energy of Kyler cure all ills?

With significant contributors Chase Edmunds, Chandler Jones and Christian Kirk all allowed to walk in free-agency, two things are obvious entering camp: Arizona needed money to afford the Murray megadeal, and the Cards might need to score 28 a game to have a playoff shot. Oh, and if James Conner stays healthy, he’s got an outside shot to win the rushing title. Finding a defensive playmaker or two will be a big priority this summer.

L.A. Rams: How big a deal is the Bobby Wagner get?

I’m very bullish on Wagner, still. He’s been PFF’s second- and 11th-rated linebacker in the last two seasons, and he comes home to southern California for the first time in 15 years, since he was a high school star in Ontario, so he’ll be motivated in a big way. With the force of Aaron Donald in front of him, and the Rams unlikely to have him play much more than maybe 60 percent of the snaps, Wagner could be the new juice the world champs need.

San Francisco: Is Trey Lance a player?

He’s an excellent prospect, for sure. And he has the faith of coach Kyle Shanahan, for sure. But this summer will be about whether Lance—who has thrown exactly 389 passes since high school—can return the Niners to the NFL’s Final Four, or perhaps go farther, and with a depleted offensive line. Every practice will be micro-analyzed, as things are with quarterbacks in the NFL. I just wish the football public would give a 22-year-old quarterback who has thrown 101 passes total in his age-20 and -21 years combined a little breathing room.

Seattle: Can a rugged defense win some games like the old days?

Whoever wins the QB job—Geno Smith, Drew Lock, maybe Jimmy Garoppolo, and my bet’s on Smith—will be commanding an okay offense at best. The keys to Seattle being competitive, I think, are Jamal Adams and Quandre Diggs, who, when healthy, make up the most formidable safety tandem in football. This summer they should take charge on a rebuilding D.

Camp: Raiders

Back to the 17-minute meeting, with Carr watching McDaniels draw up protections, and talking about better double-moves.

“This is really my favorite part of the game,” Carr volunteers in the middle of the session. “This is so much fun for me.”

I’m here as an observer, but during one pause, I had to ask Carr: “Were you a guy who watched the Patriots over the years and wonder how they did it?”

Said Carr: “I was always very intrigued with Josh and with coach Belichick. You know, obviously I’m a Raider but I really loved them. I like to watch Tom. I saw completions everywhere. And then you don’t know how they teach it. You don’t know schematically. I don’t know the words of it, but I would watch. Just watch Tom’s eyes and he’d take you to the reads.

“We’re definitely not there yet. But I think we’re playing with smart football players. It’s easier for me to go to Hunter and be like, Hey, versus coverage now, do it like this. I was always enamored with the New England system. Now I’m learning the details of it and I love it even more.”

The meeting encapsulated exactly what is so fascinating about the guts of this sport. Yeah, the Steph Curry thing was cool, but there was one specific coaching point that I can describe only so far that’s cooler. You’ll understand the importance of it as I explain it.

One of the coaching points McDaniels needed to go over with Carr was what he wanted the right tackle to do on a pass route the Raiders will use this year. McDaniels let Carr name the wrinkle on the specific block, the word he’d use in the huddle meaning what one of the 11 people in the huddle should do on the snap of the ball.

The whole thing took two minutes and 11 seconds for McDaniels and Carr to iron out. But think of it: If the tackle performs his block correctly, it could mean a 30-yard gain. Maybe a touchdown. If the tackle fails to execute the block correctly, it could be a gain of one.

Think of the minute coaching points that add up to a complete offense. Think of McDaniels spending two minutes on July 23 instructing Carr on one point for one player on a play that might be called eight times all season.

This is not entertaining, this is not compelling, it won’t be a headline in the press or a highlight on SportsCenter.

“But,” McDaniels said when I asked about it, “it is real. It is football. It is important.”

In all, these 17 minutes total one piece of a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle. Without the meeting, you don’t solve the puzzle.

“With Derek, this meeting will go to the field tomorrow,” McDaniels said. “You’re not wondering if it comes up in the second quarter, ‘Are we gonna do it? Should I close my eyes or not?’ Because you trust that he’s gonna be able to get it right.”

Now for the end game, for the fun. For coach Steph Curry.

In the Saturday afternoon post-practice tape breakdown, McDaniels showed the offending lax double-move route. He didn’t slap down the offender, just asked the offense to watch the play, and then to watch a basketball video: about 20 of the Steph Curry pump-fake/pause/defender-flies-by/calmly-hits-the-three plays. Shot after shot. “Ooooooh,” echoed in the room a few times on nice Curry threes. When it was over, one player said, “Can we watch a few more?”

Leaving Las Vegas (no pun intended, Sheryl Crow), I thought how much work the Raiders, and every team, have to do to be ready for the season. This is going to be an interesting team to watch.

Quotes of the Week 20

I

If it were a seven-game series, yeah, best team wins. That’s ultimately why, when you’re team-building, you never want to go full Rams. Because you need to give yourself three chances at it, four years at it. I know that’s hard for fans to hear.

Mahomes gets it. He’s not one to start grumbling that he’d better get his contract adjusted after two years of a 10-year deal. Now, after seven years…

I might be standing on a soapbox a little bit, but … my biggest takeaway from when I started to the end [is] football turned from a team-first to a me-type attitude … Maybe it’s because I got spoiled when I came in. The team was so important. It was all about the team. Now it’s about me and this-that-and-the-other.

Numbers Game

Kansas City’s six-year streak of AFC West titles is endangered. To discern the reasons, start by looking at the 2022 AFC West, compared to the division of the past few seasons.

Record of Kansas City versus AFC West since 2016: 31-5.

Year-by-year record of KC versus AFC West since 2016: 6-0, 5-1, 5-1, 6-0, 4-2, 5-1.

KC versus AFC West teams since 2016: 12-0 v Denver, 10-2 v Raiders, 9-3 v Chargers.

Kansas City has won the West by 5, 6, and 3 games in the last three seasons. We’re in for a tighter race this year, with the exportation of Tyreek Hill from Kansas City, and the importation of Chandler Jones and Davante Adams in Las Vegas, Russell Wilson in Denver, and Khalil Mack, J.C. Jackson and Sebastian Joseph-Day with the Chargers.

NFL Scheduling Formula Note of the Week: The NFL’s 2023 schedule ensures that Buffalo will play in Kansas City at least five times in 36 months.

January 2021, at Arrowhead: KC 38, Buffalo 24, AFC Championship Game.

October 2021, at Arrowhead: Buffalo 38, KC 20, regular season

January 2022, at Arrowhead: KC 42, Buffalo 36, AFC Divisional Game.

October 2022, at Arrowhead, Buffalo at KC, regular season.

TBD, 2023, at Arrowhead, Buffalo at KC, regular season.

I use the words “at least five times in 36 months” because the Bills could play in the postseason in Kansas City in either or both of the next two seasons.

Nolan Ryan has more strikeouts than any pitcher in baseball history and has thrown more no-hitters (Ryan has seven, Sandy Koufax is second with four) than any pitcher. He had seasons of 383, 367, 341, 329 and 327 strikeouts. He had nine complete-game shutouts in 1972, and two seasons of 26 complete games.

Ryan never won the Cy Young Award.

King of the Road

I

Five vacation highlights, from three trips (Italy, Chicago, Oregon) we put off during COVID:

1. Family time in Oregon. When my wife and I get together with daughters Laura and Mary Beth, and spouses Kim and Nick, and grandkids Freddy, Hazel and newcomer Peter, fun ensues. Freddy is 5-plus, Hazel almost 4, Peter seven months. The tough part with Freddy and Hazel is a long wait at dinner or out for a drink. So at a Willamette wine tasting, I borrowed a Burt’s Bees tube of lip balm and said to Freddy and Hazel, “Who wants to play Magic ChapStick?!!!!” Well, Freddy and Hazel did, that’s for sure. So we were over to the side of the property. I put the tube on a bench and said, “Hey, look at the owl up there!” I hid the Burt’s under my leg, and they looked. No owl. I said we’d have to think of some magic to do to make the ChapStick reappear. They thought and thought and crucial minutes flew by. Finally I said, “Let’s try this: Go touch Kim’s ankles three times. Both ankles.” They ran over, touched their Mom’s left ankle three times, then right ankle three times and ran back. There was the Burt’s Bees, standing on the bench. “THE CHAPSTICK’S BACK!!!” Freddy yelled. Three more of those episodes, and 12 to 15 minutes killed, and most of the adults could have a few sips. Good times.

2. Tuscany. My wife and I could sit and look over the vineyards all day. A couple of days, that’s what we did in the little towns of Lamole and Greve-in-Chianti.

3. Running into Peter Gammons in Chicago. I saw him July 1 at a shop just outside Wrigley Field, just before Red Sox-Cubs. I’d met Peter a few times but had never told what I’d hoped to be able to tell him. “You should know what a big influence in my life that you’ve been,” I told him. “When I was in high school in Connecticut, my father used to get the papers on the weekend, and one was the Boston Globe, and I got addicted to your Sunday baseball notes column. I always thought, ‘That’s what I want to do someday.’ And so, whatever I’ve become, I owe a lot of it you. Thank you.” It was a nice moment. Being in Wrigley is always fantastic, too.

4. Wolves and People Farmhouse Brewery, Newberg, Ore. It’s an outdoor brewpub on a farm. A hazelnut farm. Named after a game the farm owner played as a kid. What great beers. My favorite: Parrett Mountain Pils, a dry, crisp Italian pilsner with a faint lemon vibe in there. The scene was just charming—families, outdoor games, warm and sunny. A great afternoon.

5. The Oregon coast. We drove 102 miles of it. I thought, “This must be the Pacific Coast that Lewis and Clark saw 200-some years ago.” Beautiful and unspoiled in long stretches. Just lovely.

How lucky we are, to be able to take these trips and see the world. I mean, really. We’re so fortunate as a family.

II

Descending into Las Vegas Friday around 1 p.m. PT, our Delta pilot informed us, “Current temperature in Las Vegas is right around 112 degrees.”

I wondered if 110 or 115 really matters very much in the “right around” department.

Lots of reaction to the guest column in which 30 of you gave me your best ideas on how to improve the NFL. Reach me @peter_king on Twitter, or peterkingfmia@gmail.com.

Re: the first overall draft choice. From Stuart Davenport, of Las Cruces, N.M.:

“My idea: Have the two teams with the worst records play for the number one draft pick. This game could be played instead of the Pro Bowl which no one cares about. Also, having announcers, analysts and the guys in the studio pick apart why these teams are so bad on TV for 3 hours and 10 minutes might give incentive for improvements. The winner would get the first overall pick.”

I actually love this idea, Stuart. It’s a gem. Imagine a year with a Trevor Lawrence or Andrew Luck available, and imagine the competitiveness of a game like that—a playoff, essentially, for a franchise quarterback.

Re: spotting the ball better. From Jordan Gehrke:

“I’m a Chiefs season ticket holder and I ran into commissioner Goodell at the AFC Championship Game. I eventually got to ask, ‘Why can’t you guys do something about the spot? Why do we have to wait for the chain gang to come out? Can’t we just put a sensor in the ball, and across the field the way they do in tennis and then know instantly?’ He gave me two answers:

Something about how even then you would still have to decide which part of the football to put the sensor in and how would you ever really know? (I didn’t really buy this.)

He said, ‘And I’ll be honest, you gotta remember, at the end of the day, it’s still a TV show, and…we do like the drama.’

“He gave me a wink and a big smile and kept moving on to other fans. I appreciated the honesty though!”

I’ve heard that a lot, Jordan. The league likes the old-fashioned spotting and the fans having to wait 10, 12, 15 seconds to find out if the first down got made.

Re: fixing the Pro Bowl. From Steve Leppard:

FIX the Pro Bowl. Please. Does the NFL care that the Pro Bowl and skills competitions are terrible? The NBA has the dunk contest and three-point contest and MLB has the home run derby. The NFL has dodgeball. You only need one skills NFL competition at the Pro Bowl: NFL’s Fastest Man. Do a 40-yard dash and the winner gets title and $100,000 cash. Laser-time it and save records like at the combine so you can compare fastest of all time.”

The best idea of all would be to simply eliminate the Pro Bowl. You want the NFL’s fastest man? Fine. Just have that. Allow each team to enter one player. Have four heats with eight players per heat; two from each heat make the finals. Have an eight-player final. Five races in all. Make it a two-hour TV show. Nice idea, Steve.

Re: playing a Super Bowl at Lambeau. From Todd Bushmaker, of Green Bay:

“Regarding playing the Super Bowl at Lambeau, as a Packers fan and resident of the Green Bay area, I have to say this has been hashed through a million times. It would be an awesome spectacle but the fact is Green Bay cannot accommodate all the support requirements, traffic, media circus, and side events. Even counting hotels, restaurants, convention halls and other facilities within a 100-mile radius, the NFL machine just uses up too much infrastructure to make it practical up here, and we’ve come to terms with that. However, the NFL really needs to award something else to Green Bay. Most obviously we’ve applied to host the draft and are doing so again; the Packers and the Visitor and Convention Bureau have figured out that at least is possible. Let’s get ‘er done!”

Todd, technically you’re right. But this would have to be a Milwaukee/Madison/Appleton/Green Bay effort. Logistically it would be hard, but it would also be a one-time thing. The NFL could have events in all four of those cities (or at least Green Bay and Milwaukee, with overflow fans lodging in the other two cities. And yes, the inconvenience of busing 130 miles from Madison or 105 from Milwaukee in the winter wouldn’t be fun. But I love the idea of the big game at Lambeau, logistics be darned.

Re: ending games at a decent East Coast hour. From John Kirkpatrick, of Escalon, Calif.:

“One part of the column really got under my skin … the Eastern Time Zone people saying how many more people in Eastern time zone there are than the Pacific. Like we don’t matter. Starting a weekday game at 4 p.m. PT is really hard for all us Pacific time people who work for a living too. My money is just as important as yours!

Thanks, Peter, for letting me vent!”

Point made, and rather well. Thanks John.

10 Things I Think I Think 50

1. I think five things interest me about the Kyler Murray signing in Arizona:

The deal is either $46.1-million a year for five years in new money, or $38-million a year for seven years—folding in the last two years of his original contract. The new money is more than most people in the league thought Murray would get after the Cardinals started 10-2 last year then fizzled badly down the stretch. As one executive said in the wake of the deal: “$46.1 million is some crazy s— for Kyler Murray.” Here’s why I get it: The Cardinals were an irrelevant team when Murray got drafted with the first pick in 2019, coming off a 3-13 season. Murray was drafted to lift a franchise. In Murray’s first three seasons, the Cardinals have gone 24-24-1 in the regular season, and 0-1 in the playoffs. In the NFL, you’ve got no chance without a quarterback. Murray’s not a top-five quarterback, but he does give the Cardinals a good chance to win every game he starts. That makes him worth stratospheric money. Agent Erik Burkhardt will have some great stories to tell about an offseason in which he negotiated a new deal for client and Cards coach Kliff Kingsbury, advised on a new deal for Cards GM Steve Keim (Burkhardt is not his agent, but they are friends), heavily criticized the franchise right after those two deals got done for dragging feet on the Murray contract, and then negotiated a new deal for the QB. I would bet a lot of money if Burkhardt hadn’t stomped his feet last February about Murray’s deal that it wouldn’t have gotten done before training camp. The full guarantee of about $103 million is good news for the next two teams with quarterback megadeals to sign—the Chargers and Justin Herbert, and the Bengals and Joe Burrow. (I’m not a fan of making a big deal about guarantees in contracts for starting quarterbacks, because, in this case for example, the chances of Arizona cutting Kyler Murray sometime in the next five years are tiny.) Guarantees are more important because owners have to escrow 75 percent of guaranteed money in contracts. An owner like Jimmy Haslam, who has an empire of truck stops, can find $175 million to put in escrow for a Deshaun Watson contract. But because the Bengals and Chargers are mainly family-owned—as is Arizona—the funding rules hurt their ability to have huge guarantees in contracts. The funding rules, by the way, should be done away with. Teams have so much guaranteed media money coming in every year that they’re not in danger of defaulting on contracts. Point on QB contracts is this: It’s arguable now, and the Bengals and Chargers will surely make the case after Murray and Derek Carr signed deals that were not fully guaranteed, that the Watson deal is an outlier.

2. I think the weird story of the week is the impasse in negotiations between Kansas City and left tackle Orlando Brown, acquired from the Ravens in a trade last year. Here’s why it’s so weird: Adam Schefter reported that Kansas City offered to make Brown the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history: five years, $139 million, an average of $27.8 million per year. In terms of the most insane contract-related decisions of 2022, this is in the top two. For the record: One, the Browns paying a man with 24 sexual civil cases pending against him a fully guaranteed $45 million a year for five years … Two: A pretty good but not great left tackle turning down a deal that would make him the richest player in the trenches in the 103-year history of the league.

3. I think there are three factors to consider here:

1. Brown, per Schefter, nixed a deal worth $1.64 million per game. Travis Kelce’s contract pays him $621,287 per game.

2. In PFF rankings of offensive tackles who played a minimum of 800 snaps last year, Brown was the 19th-rated tackle in football.

3. Well, there’s not really a third. I’m just totally befuddled why a smart person like Brown, with one of the best jobs a tackle could ever have (blocking for Patrick Mahomes, playing in a Nirvana place like Kansas City, making more money than any lineman ever), would turn down that offer.

4. I think I had an interesting conversation with a sports attorney Saturday, an opinionated sports attorney. I asked this smart person: “What’s your gut feeling on the sanction for Deshaun Watson?” The attorney said an interesting thing: The arbitrator, Sue L. Robinson, will be making her first decision as a referee straddling the line between the NFL and the NFL Players Association, and she’ll want to be seen as very fair; so it will be tough for her to accede to what the NFL reportedly wants—a minimum of a full year’s suspension.

5. I think that Man City-Bayern Munich friendly at Lambeau Field Saturday night could be a sign of things to come. “We’d love to do it again,” Packers president Mark Murphy told me Sunday night. “Everyone in our organization loved it, and the teams seemed thrilled about it. Their people said, ‘We have never played in a stadium like this one.’ They loved the history of it. They loved our surface [an artificial base with natural grass].” Murphy said tickets were sold to people from all 50 states and to fans from 19 countries (“It’s the most diverse crowd we’ve ever had at the stadium”), and the only damper was a pair of weather delays that shortened the game from 90 to 80 minutes. Murphy said a normal Packer home game brings about $15 million in local economic impact, and he estimated this game brought in at least $10 million. One interesting point: “Some of our players came in a couple days early for camp, because they wanted to see the game. I saw Aaron Rodgers in the Man City locker room talking to one of their legends.” So many of the major European teams like to broaden their brands in the offseason, so I’d expect the Packers to work to make another game happen in 2023 or ’24.

6. I think (and this is a weird meteorological note here) that one amazing thing about covering a Raiders practice in the middle of the summer, during the day, is how different the experience is when clouds are present. On Saturday, practice started at 8:30 a.m. Accuweather said 99 degrees in Henderson, Nev. We saw only slivers of the sun for the next two hours, and the temperature was 100 at 9 a.m., 99 at 10 a.m., and 104 at 11 a.m., as the last players left the field. There was a breeze throughout. It wasn’t awful. After practice, coach Josh McDaniels said, “What a day! Wasn’t this nice? It was 111 yesterday.” Crazy, but 100 with cloud cover is not as big a deal as 86 with blazing sun.

7. I think I don’t care about the Patriots not naming offensive or defensive coordinators. I just don’t. It’s a Belichick thing. He’s mysterious. Part of him, I’m sure, isn’t sure who should call the offensive plays, and as such it’s hard to name a coordinator if that man isn’t going to call the plays.

8. I think my favorite passage of the week was Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk on the third David Tepper/Carolina Panthers executive this year leaving the organization. The mayhem around the Panthers extends to the failed practice facility and office complex the team stopped in mid-construction after a dispute over it with officials in Rock Hill, S.C. The organization looks like a mess. Writes Florio:

The off-field turmoil in the organization meshes with the team’s on-field struggles. Tepper has tried to spend his way into contention, spending big on head coach Matt Rhule, who enters 2022 on the hot seat (even if Tepper won’t admit it). Tepper also has pinballed his way through a variety of quarterbacks in search of a franchise player who will elevate the team to perennial playoff qualifier. Since 2020, the team has tried (and failed) to make it work with Teddy Bridgewater, Sam Darnold, and Cam Newton. Recently, the Panthers traded for Baker Mayfield, a buy-low proposition that Tepper hopes will cause the team to soar into one of the seven postseason berths in the NFC.

His experience through nearly five years as an NFL owner underscores the reality that no amount of success in the line of work that positions someone to buy an NFL team guarantees success. Financially, the Panthers will print as much cash as every other franchise. Competitively, Tepper’s team continues to be an also-ran. The natural frustration for a multi-billionaire who has previously seen everything he touch turn to gold but who now can’t buy his way to the top of the standings may be the common denominator in so many employees being run off.

9. I think Tepper is learning—as jillionaires Stephen Ross in Miami, Jimmy Haslam in Cleveland and Woody Johnson in New York have learned before him—that no matter how much money you walk in the door with, your team will never be good without a consistent quarterback.

10. I think these are my other thoughts of the week:

a. Podcast of the Week: Tom Rinaldi of FOX Sports with “Wesley,” the incredibly dramatic and incredibly under-told story of the life and times and murder of Lyman Bostock. “Wesley” was Bostock’s middle name.

b. I grew up a huge baseball fan. One fall Sunday afternoon in my senior year at Ohio University, I heard the news that the previous night, in Gary, Ind., Lyman Bostock was gunned down after having dinner with his uncle there. Murdered. WHATTTTT!!!!!!!! Bostock was fourth in the American League in batting average (.323) in 1976, and second (.336) in 1977, and in 1978, the Yankees and Angels had a free-agent bidding war for his services. He chose the Angels. On the last day of his life, a Saturday afternoon in September 1978 he went two-for-four in the middle of a packed Angels lineup (Grich, Lanford, Bostock, Baylor, Rudi), then drove to Gary for dinner. He was murdered at 10:20 that night by a man who thought his wife was having an affair with Bostock. (They were not.) Amazingly, the Angels played their game 15 hours later at Comiskey Park. I still shake my head about that.

c. Eight-part pod. I’ve heard the first two episodes. Two more out today, with two more each of the next two Mondays. Anyway, you all know Rinaldi as a great storyteller, which is what he is here. I never knew so many things, and I’ve always thought the only in-season murder of a major-league player in the history of baseball was one of those stories that needed to be told in long form. Who better than Rinaldi?

d. What overwhelms me with sadness after listening to the first two episodes is not that we didn’t get to see a possible Hall of Fame career play out. (He hit .311 in four seasons, and died at 28.) What hurts is not getting to see what Bostock would have accomplished off the field. He was heavily involved in civil-rights causes in college (at what is now Cal State-Northridge), and had to serve three weeks in an L.A. jail for his part in leading the takeover of a campus building when Blacks thought they were being repressed on campus. Rinaldi does a good job of illuminating the person Bostock was. I highly recommend the pod.

e. And yes, in a future column, I will discuss the Andrew Luck podcast by Zak Keefer of The Athletic. Need to listen to it in full. But I hear good things.

f. Story of the Week: Campbell Robertson of the New York Times, on the story of a wealthy Kentucky man who constructed what he thought was an impenetrable home with a luxury bunker made to survive a nuclear or civil war.

g. The headline: “He built a home to survive a Civil War. Tragedy found him anyway.” That’ll get you to read the story, or at least it should. And the words that follow are just as riveting. Tragedy befell the C. Wesley Morgan family with the murder of daughter Jordan, and now they’re trying to find some new normal.

h. Wrote Campbell:

On a warm evening at a public campground in central Kentucky, Mr. Morgan, 71, sat in a folding chair, watching his wife, Lindsey, and 14-year-old daughter, Sydney, take a walk among the campers and R.V.s. He was spending his nights in agony over Jordan’s death, he said. She had been shot at least 11 times in her bed. Just thinking about it, he said, was like being strangled.

His days were spent overseeing repairs to his bullet-riddled house and talking to potential buyers.

He had built the house in the Obama years, when he was convinced society was on the verge of collapse. Here his family could live in secluded comfort, and if the social fabric truly tore apart, as he expected it would, they could wait out the chaos in an abundantly stocked underground bunker. Now he couldn’t wait to be rid of it.

“Our life hasn’t been right since I started construction on that son of a bitch.”

i. What a story.

j. Educational Story of the Week: Hannah Seo of the New York Times, on some myths about the body’s need for water, and about the foods that matter to keep you hydrated:

k. Why did I pick this story to highlight? Because of this, per Seo:

Taking in liquids is crucial, but hydration can go beyond simply drinking water. The popular belief that we all need to be drinking eight cups a day to be truly hydrated persists, though it has been debunked again and again.

“There’s really no data behind the eight glasses of water a day thing,” said Dr. Dan Negoianu, a nephrologist at the University of Pennsylvania. For example, “just because your urine is dark, that doesn’t prove that you’re dehydrated.”

l. I had no idea the eight-glasses-of-water-a-day thing had been debunked. I thought I should be doing that. Anyway, it’s informative and good to know that vegetables and fruits can hydrate us very nicely, and almost exclusively if we choose.

m. You know who’s got a really interesting Substack? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Very good writer. Pulls zero punches.

n. Kareem on the Elvis movie is biting and insightful. So cool to see him flex his writing muscles here, and elsewhere.

o. Wrote Abdul-Jabbar:

I feel about Elvis the way I feel about most biopics of musicians: it will do until a good one comes along. That’s because these movies often are so rigidly formulaic that it’s like going on a blind date that turns out to be someone you dated once in high school 20 years ago—and they haven’t changed a bit. You already know everything they’re going to say—every joke, every anecdote, every everything.

…That’s the movie Elvis. The only reason to stay is the vibrant and energetic music. When Elvis sings, the movie bursts into glorious technicolor. The rest of the time: black-and-white meh. Basically, the movie is nothing more than a bland delivery system for the tasty soundtrack, like a gallon of white rice with only a couple tablespoons of delicious curry tikka floating on top.

p. Kareem from the top rope!

q. Happy 76th anniversary, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. Wow. Just wow.

r. Happy 60th, Dean Biasucci. Man, that makes us old guys feel older.

s. I found it sad last week—maybe it’s a big reason why I’m languishing in sixth place in my rotisserie baseball league—that for the first time ever the baseball All-Star Game featured a player I’d never heard of. Joe Mantiply. When I looked over the rosters last Monday, I said, “Who is Joe Mantiply?” Arizona relief pitcher. Two saves, nice ERA, gotta pick one player from each team, D-Backs are lousy. So of course Mantiply pitched one easy 1-2-3 inning, fanning Xader Bogaerts in the process, and good for him. But a sign of the times in baseball, I guess…a sign that I’m not paying the attention to the game I once did.

t. Profile of the Week: Joseph Bien-Smith, writing in Sports Illustrated’s Where Are They Now issue about the great sportswriter Gary Smith. The story first appeared in Victory Journal.

u. Gary Smith is peerless in our industry. But he’s been out of circulation for a few years, and out of the pages of SI, so many of us have lost track of him. Bien-Smith does a good job, not just of finding him in South Carolina, but of explaining why he was so great at his long profiles—four a year.

v. Bien-Smith relayed a story about Smith from the eighties that is so Smith.

Gary Smith boarded the first train out of Rome and took it to the end of the line. He crossed the street right as a bus pulled up and rode it to the end of the line too. Now, a little red car slid to a stop beside his outstretched thumb and a man with wild black hair and wild black eyes beckoned him to get in.

It was a linguistic scramble as the man attempted to engage Smith. Italian, then English, and finally a slapdash mess of Spanish and French to get to the most pressing matter: “Where to?”

“Wherever you’re going,” Smith responded. And so, the man turned the key and they set off, the Talking Heads’ “Psycho Killer” playing on repeat. Eventually, they pulled into a tiny village, Castel Viscardo, on the calf of Italy’s boot, 4,200 miles and a universe from the Midtown Manhattan Sports Illustrated office. It was late summer, 1983.

Gary Smith stayed in town that night, and then for months thereafter, working at the brickyard and picking the region’s famous grapes.

w. Years later, Bien-Smith got one more detail from Smith:

“When I got to the end of the line, I got off and put my thumb out,” he says. “Whoever picked me up, wherever they were going, that was where I was gonna land. And, you know, just see what happened.”

x. That’s just living life. That’s what Smith did, and still does. The other good thing about this piece is list links of some of his best stories. I think particularly you’ll enjoy the prescient Tiger Woods tale.

With Kyler Murray becoming the latest quarterback to land a major contract, let’s take a look at who’s next to cash in, either this year or next. (Or, maybe, not at all.)

Lamar Jackson.

The Ravens quarterback spent months resisting the team’s overtures to do a long-term deal. Now, he wants to get his second contract. Complicating matters is that he has no agent. He has said that contracts signed by other quarterbacks don’t matter to him, which is a clear example of why he desperately needs an agent. Those other deals become precedent for his own, a bar that he should strive to meet or to exceed.

It’s a challenge to separate team from self when it comes to getting a fair contract. Some players get brainwashed by the idea that they owe it to the broader effort to leave extra meat on the bone. Other players recognize that their duty to themselves and their families is to maximize the value that they generate from playing football, because their time for doing so is extremely short. They have no equity in the business. They have only what they can squeeze from ownership and squirrel away in the bank.

Yes, it’s a team sport. But there definitely is a “me” in team when it comes to ensuring that full and fair value is generated by a player who has earned every penny he makes, and who is entitled to pursue as many pennies as he can from owners who have money to burn — and to buy superyachts with.

Russell Wilson.

Deshaun Watson leveraged the quasi-free agency he finagled for himself into a brand-new, market-setting deal. Wilson, who had only one place he truly wanted to play if not Seattle, didn’t take advantage of the opportunity to ask for more on the way through the door.

And that’s a smart move, because he’ll get even more after the 2022 season.

With the richest owner by far poised to buy the team, and with the team giving up so much in trade assets to get Wilson, he’ll get a market-value deal after the season. It likely will be fully guaranteed.

Is there a chance that injury or ineffectiveness hurts his value? Yes, but it’s slim. The Broncos essentially accepted the fact that Wilson will get a monster deal the moment the trade happened. By not doing it now, they know they’ll be paying him even more later.

That said, there’s a chance that the Wal-Mart clan will decide to make Wilson an offer he can’t and won’t refuse before the start of the 2022 regular season. Again, it will be cheaper to do it now than next year, and the terms could be so good for Wilson that he won’t want to carry the risk of having injury or subpar play cloud his value come next year.

Joe Burrow.

His window on a new contract opens at the conclusion of the 2022 regular season. Burrow already has earned his second deal. And who knows? He could be the first young quarterback to get his second contract after the final game of the regular season and before the start of the postseason, if the Bengals qualify for the playoffs again.

Burrow may face local pressure to “take less.” Hopefully, he won’t. He has transformed that franchise. He deserves everything he’s able to get. If they want to keep him for the long haul, they need to change their ways — and they possibly already are, given that they’re finally selling stadium naming rights.

That said, it may be difficult to get a fully-guaranteed deal, if owner Mike Brown simply can’t put a giant pile of cash into escrow. Maybe Burrow will be the first quarterback to hinge his compensation to a specific percentage of the cap. Thus, as it goes up, he get more — and his contract never becomes obsolete.

Justin Herbert.

Two great years, no playoff berths. That doesn’t matter. He’s already regarded as one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL. If the Chargers want to keep him, they’ll have to pay up. Presumably after the 2022 season ends. If they won’t, someone else gladly will, now or later.

Jalen Hurts.

The Eagles have sent mixed signals, publicly and privately, regarding their commitment to Hurts. The commitment to the 2020 second-round pick seemingly was made when the Eagles traded for receiver A.J. Brown.

Here’s the question. Will Hurts deliberately take a second-tier deal in order to ensure that the Eagles will always have a solid team around him?

The fact that he wasn’t a first-round pick will bring his long-term status to a head sooner than otherwise. He’ll be a free agent in March 2024, unless the Eagles apply the franchise tag. His performance this season will go a long way toward helping the Eagles peg his future value. The challenge then will be getting on the same page with Hurts.

Tua Tagovailoa.

He’s also entering his third season. After it ends, he’ll be eligible for a new deal. It’s the ultimate upside for delivering on his potential, and for taking full advantage of the help he’ll have around him.

If he doesn’t step up, however, he could end up looking elsewhere for his second NFL contract, either if he’s released after the 2022 season or if he becomes a free-agent when his four-year rookie deal expires.

Baker Mayfield.

He’s on a one-year deal in Carolina. If he performs well, the Panthers will surely want to keep him. Others will become interested.

Surprisingly, the multi-million-dollar haircut Mayfield took to grease the skids out of Cleveland didn’t include a promise from the Panthers not to apply the franchise tag next year. If he overachieves this season, he may find himself blocked from the open market by the tag.

Jimmy Garoppolo.

Unless he signs a long-term deal as part of a trade to a new team, Garoppolo will become a free agent in March. That makes it critical for him to find a place where he can play — and play well — in 2022.

Daniel Jones.

The Giants didn’t pick up his fiffth-year option. The 2019 top-10 pick enters a contract year. If he becomes the guy the Giants thought he’d be three years ago, he’ll get a long-term deal or the franchise tag.

Ryan Tannehill.

He’s got two years left on his current deal. He was absent from some of the voluntary offseason program, possibly in an effort to get an adjustment. After this season, the Titans may have to make a long-term decision. Which may be one of the reasons why they drafted Malik Willis.

Matt Ryan.

He has two years on his contract, as he enters his first season with the Colts. If he delivers, the team may want to give him a big pile of money in order to ensure that he’ll be around for a few more seasons.

Tom Brady.

The GOAT will be a free agent in 2023. He’ll be able to pick his next team, unrestricted and unfettered. And with $37.5 million per year waiting for him from Fox, he’ll be able to tell anyone who wants him to keep playing that, in order to get him, they’ll have to pay him more than what he’d be getting to not actually play."

‘Y’all don’t think I can read a damn teleprompter?","ALLEN PARK, Mich. — When you set out to write something positive about the Detroit Lions, there’s got to be a certain amount of wishful thinking involved. And so what, really? The Lions being mostly rancid for generations seems cruel and unusual punishment for any fan base, never mind this good one, so when you see signs the franchise might actually be competent, you leap on it. Like, well, a lion on wagyu.

As a Lions’ May OTA workout finished and 50-some players filed off the field in small groups, player after player came to greet Detroit GM Brad Holmes on the edge of the field. “Bossman!” one said with a big hug. Fifteen, 20 players embraced or bro-hugged or fist-bumped, some stopping for five seconds, some for a minute. This was not the dog days of training camp, or a Wednesday practice with the team on a four-game losing streak, but still it was a little unusual to see this affection for a general manager. PDAs with GMs are not all that common in the world I cover.

“Good observation,” Holmes said when I asked him about it later. “We’ve got a really good group, a group of men who are in this for the right reasons, who really want to win and invest the time in their team. Sometimes we talk about deeper things. I’ll tell them about books I’ve read, lessons I’ve learned. I care about them as people.”

The Lions have won one playoff game in the last 60 years—two less than the Bengals won last January—and we all know that the players being cool with the general manager won’t equate to wins. But it says something to me that players on a team with 11 wins in the last three years might actually like where they are.

This team has some momentum after a competitive end to 2021; Detroit was 3-3 after Dec. 1. I’ll be surprised if they’re not close to .500 this year. Close, to me, is seven or eight wins.

“We kind of feel like we may be Rich Strike here,” head coach Dan Campbell told me.

Rich Strike, the Kentucky Derby winner, who raced to the upset of upsets in that weird, wild race back in May.

“He was 16th with 33 seconds left in the race,” I said.

“One of the most inspiring things I’ve seen in a long time,” Campbell said. “It was impressive. It was beautiful.

“I just think I’ve got guys like Rich Strike. Every time we hear the S-O-L, same old Lions, and all the stuff, I think it fuels our fire. We love it. I think that’s how we all feel. That’s how we all talk. That’s how we all think. There’s nothing fake about it.”

Rich Strike passed the favored horses in the final seconds of the Kentucky Derby. I’m not even going to mention that the Lions close the 2022 season in Week 18 at Green Bay.

The Lead: Hungry Lions

Happy to be back in the saddle for another season of Football Morning in America. As we approach the 25th anniversary of this column—I started Monday Morning Quarterback at Sports Illustrated in 1997 and transitioned to FMIA here at NBC in 2018—we’ve got some compelling stories to follow in the run-up to the NFL season. My training camp trip will start in Las Vegas later this week. The Raiders … that’s a really interesting story to kick it off.

There will be time to write about Deshaun Watson more than I do this week. Because that story is still very much up in the air, I’ll touch on it here but wanted to bring something from the field to kick off the fifth FMIA season.

I’m more bullish on the Lions than the wiseguys are, more bullish than the NFL is. Detroit’s the only team in the NFL without a primetime game this year, and the Lions are booked for zero network doubleheader windows—the late Sunday afternoon games shown nationally. When the NFL came out with its schedule, the anonymity of the Lions was an exclamation point. Seventeen games, 17 starts at 1 p.m. or 12:30 p.m. ET. The league did assign the Lions to HBO’s “Hard Knocks,” but that’s no sign that playoffs are nigh. Most often, Hard Knocks is about which team the league can arm-twist hard enough to do it.

Hard to blame the Howard Katz scheduling team for consigning the Lions (11-36-2 in the last three years) to Siberia. Everyone wonders about quarterback Jared Goff, everyone wonders about last year’s 31st-rated scoring defense, everyone wonders about how much impact No. 2 overall draft pick Aidan Hutchinson can provide on said defense, and everyone wonders whether the Dan Campbell Way will be more emotional schtick than true winning leadership. I wonder too.

But when you look at teams and try to project the future—and when you try to project a few out-of-the-box things that make sense the following season—you land on teams that showed promise late the previous year and had a good offseason. Check and check for the Lions. And when I visited the Lions in the spring, I saw some things that I did not see in the Matt Patricia Lions (which admittedly is a low bar):

The ’22 Lions fought to the end. Patricia’s 2019 team was 0-9 after Halloween. The Patricia/Darrell Bevell team went 1-6 down the stretch in 2020 and surrendered 30 or more points in their last six games. Last year, the Lions were 0-10-1 entering December, going absolutely nowhere. They finished 3-3, routing the playoff Cardinals. They showed up. They beat the Vikings at :00 on a Goff-to-Amon-Ra St. Brown TD pass. I know Detroit lost in routs to Denver and Seattle late in the year, but players who are mailing it in don’t play the way these guys did down the stretch.

These players respect and will play hard for Campbell. So last year Campbell was tough on the inconsistent Goff—and rightfully so. But who did Goff look to hug after that euphoric win over the Vikings? Campbell. “That’s the way to throw it when we needed it, m—–f—–!” Campbell yelled into Goff’s earhole on the field.

Buy-in. “People outside the building can’t see it, obviously,” Goff told me. “But we have a plan, and we’re all-in. People see some of what Dan says, and that’s great. But I can tell you—Dan knows what the hell he’s talking about, and he’s got the respect of that [locker] room.”

“2021 won’t be in vain, I promise you that,” Campbell told me after this spring practice I saw.

“I know that people are probably tired of hearing foundation and the culture, but I do feel like we set that in year one. I do feel like that for us was the primary goal. We have to create our own style, our own identity, our own culture of who we are, what we accept, what we don’t accept, and now let’s build from there. Now, in year two, we feel like we have that foundation built now. Let’s start stacking on top of it.”

Culture. It’s such an amorphous thing. With Campbell and Holmes, I think the best way to describe it is: We’re never taking a play off, we’re going to import players who love to play, we’re going to be very physical, we’re going to stay together, and nobody’s going to make an excuse. That last thing, about excuse-making, interests me. When coaches get fired, often they have a litany of games they coulda/woulda/shoulda won. You hear it all the time.

You won’t hear it from Dan Campbell, or from his players. Example: Baltimore 19, Detroit 17. Justin Tucker’s 66-yard field goal, which hit the crossbar and bounced over, on the last play of the game beat the Lions last October. Seemed cruel. The officials clearly missed a 40-second clock violation by the Ravens in the closing seconds that would have resulted in a 10-second runoff and time expiring—and a 17-16 Detroit win.

Lots of reasons for the Lions to feel jobbed after that game, but Campbell told me he won’t stand for it.

“So Baltimore, what I want to get across is that stuff, ‘Ah, the ref should’ve stopped it, the play clock ran out,’ it’s all irrelevant. What matters is we lost. We caused that. They earned it. We didn’t earn it. We had them exactly where we wanted. We had a sack. The clock’s running. We got them in the fourth down and forever. They executed, and we didn’t. I think those things are important. We don’t want guys that have excuses. We don’t want to talk about excuses. We don’t want to talk about ‘we got screwed.’ To me, winners find a way to win.”

Oldest cliché in football. But it’s been spouted by the best to ever do it. In the end, you are what your record says you are, and no one’s changing the score on Tuesday.

In many ways, 2022 for the Lions is about 2023. This year’s a proving year for Jared Goff—who probably will have a plus receiving corps by Thanksgiving in St. Brown, D.J. Chark and the rehabbing Jameson Williams, plus tight end T.J. Hockenson. That group is more than solid. If Goff plays at a B level and proves his worth, great. If he doesn’t, the Lions save $20.65 million on the 2023 cap by jettisoning him next March. Williams, who might have been the first wideout picked had he not torn his ACL in the College Football Playoff, won’t be rushed this year; drafting him was a long-term play by Holmes. Hutchinson will have expectations this year, but it’s rare that rookie edge players are stars in year one. And Holmes will have two first-round picks again next year.

I wasn’t crazy about Holmes taking on Goff and his big contract after his shaky end with the Rams. But he had to do it if he wanted the two first-round picks. The reality now is that the deal is Stafford for Goff, Jameson Williams and a 2023 first-round pick, give or take the millions for Goff and some other draft tentacles. If the two ones next year have to be packaged for a QB in the draft, then it’d be Stafford for Williams and a new quarterback. And man, there’d be pressure on Holmes to pick the right QB of the future, and on the QB to produce at a playoff level. That’s some pressure.

Goff knows this is a crucial year in his football life. It’s already been an eventful 2022. In his California house on Super Sunday, Goff watched Matthew Stafford, the man who replaced him (and who he replaced here), win a Super Bowl on the SoFi home field Goff had christened a year earlier. “No bitterness—I guess that’s the way people would expect me to feel,” Goff said. “Happy for my former teammates and coaches, but as a competitor, of course, I want to win one too.” The Lions promoted tight ends coach Ben Johnson to offensive coordinator, and then drafted Williams in a first-round shocker in April.

But we still don’t know if Goff can put a stranglehold on the job in 2022. He did leave a positive impression down the stretch in 2021, going 3-1 in his last four starts (103.3 rating, 67-percent accuracy, 26.5 points per game). Goff’s Detroit future—and probably his starting future in the NFL—will depend on whether he can be a consistent starter and fourth-quarter impact player with his rookie coordinator calling the shots. Goff needs to be better, much better, in crunch time. TD-interception ratio in the first three quarters of games last year: 16-to-3. In the fourth quarter: 3-to-5.

I expect the Lions to emphasize short and intermediate accuracy in the Johnson offense, because that’s where Goff is efficient. That could change when the game-breaking Williams comes back. (There’s no projection right now, but post-Thanksgiving is a safe bet.)

“I think Goff’s in a real good place.” Campbell said. “Finished strong last year. I like the fact that we’ve got pieces around him that I think are going to help pull the most out of him. We’ve got some pieces here that complement each other that really will help him be the best that he can be. Listen, he’s an accurate quarterback. That’s what he does well. He can throw the football and he can put it right on the money.”

We’ll see. One story about the man who could help save Goff that I learned here:

Holmes, in almost two decades with the Rams climbing the scouting ladder, adopted this drafting mantra: Don’t pick hurt guys in the first round. Too risky. Williams played just one season at Alabama after transferring from Ohio State, but his 19.9-yards-per-catch average on 79 catches vaulted him to strong first-round candidate as 2022 dawned. But on Jan. 10, in the national title game, Williams tore his ACL.

On an April Sunday, three months after the injury and a couple of weeks before the draft, Holmes took a free day to watch the top receivers—including Williams. He sat home, just him and the video. And he fell in love with Williams, over all the other receivers. “I had Jameson in his own box,” Holmes said. “You want to be as sure as possible with first-round players, of course, and I was absolutely convicted on Jameson … the speed, how fluid he was, how confident he played. I consulted with our medial team, and they felt it was a clean ACL tear.

“So now I had to get comfortable with picking an injured player. I thought, I can’t preach to our organization to be open-minded with their decisions if I’m not going to be open-minded myself.”

The thought of having a franchise receiver for, say, a few games this year and maybe eight years more outweighed the risk of Williams breaking down again to Holmes. He didn’t have to convince Campbell, who also felt Williams was well worth a first-round pick. Then it was up to Holmes to move up to a spot to get him from late in the round. It cost the 32nd and 34th picks (other picks were involved) to move to the 12th slot and, God forbid, Holmes traded with a division rival to do it. He moved up 20 slots in a deal with Minnesota. “I’m not into the old-school, archaic way of never trading within the division,” Holmes said. “It made a ton of sense for both teams.”

On New Year’s Day, Hutchinson and Williams were lock top-10 picks. Maybe top-five. The Lions got them second and 12th overall, with the obvious asterisk on Williams, and they’re euphoric. Hutchinson’s that rare player who actually wanted to get picked by Detroit, his hometown team. That was his choice, and his family’s. Good sign for the Lions. Hutchinson, at Michigan, was a strong run player who also was a terror on quarterbacks. Detroit allowed 31 TD passes and a pathetic 101.0 passer rating last year, so the need for Hutchinson to be impactful right away is great.

This is time of the column for the pithy quote summing up the optimism of a long-downtrodden team. I don’t have one. This team will be better, without question. This team will be significantly better only if Goff is consistently productive, and if he bonds well with the new coordinator, and if he gets familiar fast with Jameson Williams—whenever he returns. Those are big ifs. But that’s the truth about the 2022 Lions, who should be a fascinating watch.

Summer Nuggets 10

While I was away, the NFL world kept spinning. This stuff happened:

The Deshaun Watson suspension moves close to decision day. The NFL has concluded its investigation into the new Cleveland quarterback, accused of sexual assault by 25 massage therapists in the Houston area. Watson has spoken to league investigators and to the arbitrator in the case, Sue Robinson, a former federal judge, and a decision about the length of suspension is expected before the end of the month. The league wants an indefinite suspension and would like to see Watson miss most, if not all, of 2022, minimum. After all but four of the complainants settled their civil cases with Watson in June, it seemed the case was on course for a milder sanction of Watson—multiple games but not a full season. But with Jenny Vrentas of the New York Times reported Watson had booked massage appointments with at least 66 women from 2019 to 2021, the suspicions supported by many of the women gained traction. If the league, or Robinson, doesn’t come down hard on Watson, with all the accusatory evidence in the public sphere already, it will look like a giant whitewash.

The Texans paid to rid themselves of the Watson headache. Did the Texans help Watson book massage appointments knowing many of the therapists had had unpleasant experiences with the star quarterback? We may never know the truth there. But it’s pretty creepy that the franchise wrote a check to get rid of the problem, which the Texans did last week when they settled with 30 women who accused Watson of impropriety. This whole story stinks, and Watson’s former and current teams are feeling the heat right now.

Baker Mayfield traded to Carolina. “No animosity toward Cleveland,” Mayfield said in his introductory Carolina press conference. Suuuuure, Baker. The Browns got a fifth-round pick that could rise to a fourth from Carolina for Mayfield, who will duel (and, I assume, win at some point) for the starting QB job in Charlotte with Sam Darnold. This seemed inevitable once all the other musical chairs for quarterbacks got filled. In some ways, it’s a sad end for a guy who was drafted to make the Browns competitive, and in his last significant game as a Brown did exactly what the Browns drafted him to do: He beat the Steelers in Pittsburgh in a playoff game with the head coach and offensive guru back in Cleveland with COVID. Kind of cool that the season-opener is Cleveland at Carolina on Sept. 11.

Raiders try to clean up a messy front office. In hiring the first Black woman franchise president in league history, Las Vegas native Sandra Douglass Morgan, Raiders owner Mark Davis is trying to buy the stability he hasn’t had since the departure of president Mark Badain one year ago this week. Dan Ventrelle took over for Badain and was dismissed this year after complaining of a hostile work environment. So Morgan will be asked to do much of what Jason Wright was asked to do in Washington when he took over as president in the midst of the Daniel Snyder crisis: fix a floundering franchise. The difference with the Raiders, of course, is that the football team should contend this year, something that looks unlikely in Washington.

Heinz Field no more. No one can knock the Steelers for taking $10 million a year for a stadium naming rights deal, but Acrisure Stadium doesn’t have nearly the same ring as a loyal hometown company, Heinz. It’s been Heinz Field since the opening of the new place in 2001, and there weren’t many stadium names as synonymous with the team as this one.

Is Matthew Berry bound for NBC? In my last column June 6, I forecast Berry being a free-agent this summer, and it came to pass last Monday. I don’t understand ESPN letting the biggest name (by far) in the fantasy football business walk away, and I probably never will. I expect NBC (as Andrew Marchand of the New York Post reported) to land Berry, and if so, I expect that he will be a significant part of the Football Night in America show—in both fantasy-forecasting and football-oddsmaking stuff. If that happens, there will be two new faces on the Sunday night show: new analyst Jason Garrett and Berry.

Von Miller signed for six years and thinks he can play for six years. In most circles, this is considered lunacy: a player who missed 18 games in his age-31 and -32 season thinking he can play full seasons at 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 and 38. “Tom Brady’s done it, Bruce Smith has done it. My intention is to play the whole thing out,” Miller said, per Mark Gaughan of the Buffalo News. Good for him. It would be great to see him do it. But Miller missed 18 games in his age-31 and -32 seasons due to injury; Brady, of course, missed zero games due to injury between 32 and 37, and Smith missed two. So I think the actuarial tables won’t like the odds of him playing the next six years healthy in Buffalo.

Numbers Game 20

Everything you need to know about the crapshoot that was the 2018 draft:

Cleveland took Baker Mayfield first overall, and the Jets took Sam Darnold third overall. In a week or so, they’ll start battling it out to be the starting quarterback of the Carolina Panthers.

That’s weird enough. But the other thing that’s notable about the 2018 draft is that, all things considered, picks 11 through 20 are better than picks one through 10 after four seasons.

I’m open to arguments here, but how I’d rate the first 10 and second 10 of the 2018 draft. Players in italic are not with their drafting team in 2022.

Picks 1 through 10

1. Baker Mayfield, QB, Cleveland: C-plus

2. Saquon Barkley, RB, NY Giants: Incomplete (21 missed games due to injury)

3. Sam Darnold, QB, NY Jets: D

4. Denzel Ward, QB, Cleveland: B-plus

5. Bradley Chubb, edge, Denver: Incomplete (24 missed games due to injury)

6. Quenton Nelson, G, Indianapolis: A-minus

7. Josh Allen, QB, Buffalo: A

8. Roquan Smith, LB, Chicago: B

9. Mike McGlinchey, T, San Francisco: B-minus

10. Josh Rosen, QB, Arizona: F

Picks 11 through 20

11. Minkah Fitzpatrick, S, Miami: A-minus

12. Vita Vea, DT, Tampa Bay: A-minus

13. Daron Payne, DT, Washington: B-plus

14. Marcus Davenport, DE, New Orleans: B

15. Kolton Miller, T, Las Vegas: B-plus

16. Tremaine Edmunds, LB, Buffalo: B-minus

17. Derwin James, S, L.A. Chargers: Incomplete (29 missed games due to injury)

18. Jaire Alexander, CB, Green Bay: A-minus

19. Leighton Vander Esch, LB, Dallas: C-minus

20. Frank Ragnow, C, Detroit: B-plus*

The best player from the top 20 in the 2018 draft was picked in the top 10—Josh Allen, at seven. But in overall quality, I’d grade eight players in the second 10 at B-minus or better, with five graded that way in the top 10.

It’s all subjective, of course. But the meh overall play of Mayfield and Darnold, at least to this point, drags down the top of the 2018 draft.

Factoidness

In June, Aria Hutchinson, the sister of Aidan Hutchinson, the second pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, was crowned Miss Michigan.

So, someone in the family did get picked number one in 2022.

II

What Carolina traded to acquire its top three quarterbacks:

• Baker Mayfield (July 2022): A conditional fifth-round pick in 2023.

• Sam Darnold (April 2021): A sixth-round pick in 2021 and second- and fourth-round picks in 2022.

• Matt Corral (April 2022): A fourth-round pick in 2022 and a third- in ’23.

Interesting. I’d put my money on Mayfield to win the starting job. If so, Carolina spent a 5 on the starter (which could rise to a 4), and a 2, 3, 4, 4 and 6 on his backups.

My wife and I flew a lot on vacation, making up for some Covid-delayed trips, including a 40th-anniversary jaunt to Italy. I am pleasantly surprised—shocked, really—to report we experienced zero problems.

In June, we flew to London and then to Rome, and then from Rome back to New York. Three flights (Delta, the former Alitalia, Delta), zero delays. Zero long lines to fight at JFK, Heathrow and Rome.

We flew LaGuardia to Chicago, round trip, Delta, around the Fourth of July. All good on the way there, and we were early coming home … when the only issue of our time away hit. “Ladies and gentlemen,” the pilot said after we’d been sitting at the gate for 10 minutes, no sign of a jet bridge. “You probably are aware of the issues the airlines have been having recently. Unfortunately, this is the first day on the job for our jet-bridge operator, and he felt like he needed some help. So someone is on the way to help.” Ten minutes. Later, we deplaned. Now that was pretty cool transparency. We gave the pilot and crew a big hand for it, and for, at least as I saw it, performing well with lots of pressure and anger at the airports in the last couple of months.

I flew to Los Angeles on some personal business last week. Delta again. Morning rush hour. No lines at security. We did have a 10- or 15-minute delay because of a flat tire on the landing gear. But the flight, due in at noon in L.A., arrived at 11:56. On the return the next day, on time again.

I plan to have some other vacation thoughts, including a pleasant surprise at Wrigley Field, in next week’s column.

When I spent two days with Hank Goldberg in January 2020, he shared the details of his amazing life and then asked, ""If I were selling tickets to my life, would you buy one?"" Answer: I'd buy one for me and everyone I know. RIP Hammerhttps://t.co/Rnzdp45rHC — Gene Menez (@genemenez) July 4, 2022

Menez writes for CBS SportsLine, and he penned this terrific tribute to Hank Goldberg, the sports insider and gambling maven, when Goldberg died on July 4.

Great passage in Menez’s tribute to Hammerin’ Hank:

Four nights before the 2004 Belmont Stakes, Goldberg, who provided horse racing analysis for ESPN at the time, had his annual dinner at Umberto’s pizzeria with trainer and longtime friend Nick Zito. That year, Zito had entered a promising runner named Birdstone in the demanding 1½-mile Belmont, but the colt was coming off a disappointing eighth-place finish in the Kentucky Derby and was a double-digit longshot. He was set to face the undefeated and ultra impressive Smarty Jones, who was looking to become the first Triple Crown winner since 1978 and had been installed as the heavy 2-5 morning-line favorite.

“Nick said, ‘This horse that I have has been training his eyeballs out in Saratoga, and nobody knows it,'” Goldberg recalled. “He said, ‘The race really sets up for him.’ He said Smarty Jones’ jockey [Stewart Elliott] would screw up on the backside. ‘Our horse will be off-the-pace and will run down Smarty Jones. Trust me.’ So I figured, what the hell?”

Goldberg used Birdstone in his Pick 4, daily double, exacta, trifecta and superfecta wagers. Smarty Jones left the starting gate at 3-10, while Birdstone went off at 36-1, the third-longest shot in the nine-horse field.

The race played out exactly as Zito had predicted, with Elliott moving prematurely on Smarty Jones and Birdstone surging past in the final strides of the race. Goldberg won $24,000.

Lots of topics covered over my vacation time. You can reach me at peterkingfmia@gmail.com, or on Twitter @peter_king.

Amen. From Rob Neal: “Why is it every preseason the NFL holds voluntary workouts and we get subjected to ‘Player X isn’t attending’ breathless articles and media weigh-ins about who is and who isn’t there? I get the 24-hour media cycle and non-stop NFL push for news but this is such a nothing burger. Truly, fans don’t care. The whole narrative of questioning a player’s commitment to their team based on whether they come early to work out with their team is overwrought and stupid.”

I’ve been saying this for years. It’s one of the reasons running The MMQB, my website at Sports Illustrated, got so draining. Because so many reporters cover pro football exclusively, and because there is such competition in the field, much more stuff gets covered. So now, because football media is working in May and June, camp attendance becomes news. Somehow, some way, the people who are covering the sport have to find things to write and talk about.

Here’s the way I look at “news” in the 10 weeks from about May 5 to July 15: I don’t. When I see that Lamar Jackson is not attending voluntary workouts and someone is parsing what it means, I immediately think: There is absolutely, positively no way that, in the midst of a three-game losing streak in November, anyone will write or say, Baltimore is in the toilet because Lamar Jackson didn’t practice with the team last May. If anyone actually would say that, he/she would immediately be shouted down as an excuse-maker. So it would be nice if every team had perfect attendance at every off-season event, but there’s a reason the things are called “voluntary.” Anyway, that’s my take, Rob.

Done with the Browns. From Ken Gilroy, of Cleveland: “I’m a lifelong Browns fan in my fifties and, for the life of me, I just can’t bear the idea of watching another Browns game. This is the first time I can remember that I haven’t once read or watched a game/player-related piece on the team in the runup to the regular season, and I don’t plan on paying attention once the schedule begins, either. The reason behind this personal blackout: I’m disgusted by the Deshaun Watson signing. I’ve got five sisters and two daughters, and there’s no way I believe that 24 unrelated women are fabricating eerily similar stories about one man’s predatory behavior. Am I an outlier, or are you hearing from other fans who are giving up on the Browns and the NFL because of this classless signing?”

I don’t think you’re an outlier, Ken. But that’s a gut feeling based on what I’ve read. I haven’t taken the temperature of Browns fans and have not been to Cleveland since the signing. I will be there in training camp, and will certainly ask around about the effect of the signing and—in my opinion—the ridiculous guaranteed contract that protects Watson in the event of a suspension, which is surely coming. A good friend of mine texted after I wrote my column highly critical of the Browns after the trade and the $230-million contract. He told me he’s done with football. Now, he may be or he may not be. But that’s the kind of emotion I heard when this trade and signing happened.

Good messages in the grad speeches. From Jeff Scholl: “Appreciate you sharing the graduation speeches. Louis Riddick had a great message that many people need to hear at all stages of our lives: We may take a path simply on belief not knowing where it will take us. I love the ‘Life is service’ message from Elizabeth Bonker [the autistic Rollins College student], referencing Fred Rogers. I will be 59 next week and am working to find a bridge from where I am now to wherever life will take me next. I believe God is always sending us answers and inspiration and these two messages hit a note for me.”

Thanks, Jeff. There’s a reason I led the column with Riddick and had the Rollins student up high.

A Canadian checks in with a good lesson. From Jim Cameron: “One of the greatest speeches I ever received was very short but very effective. When I was in grade six my teacher told me: ‘James, nothing good will ever become of you.’ Fortunately for me I’m wired wrong and it became incredibly motivating. There were other hiccups. My parents decided when I entered high school that I would be forced into general classes which meant that university would not be an option. Luckily for me that was enough motivation and I spent four summers in school upgrading my education just for the chance to go to university. I had worked so hard both scholastically and work-wise, a physical job that took a lot of me, often working 35 to 40 hours a week while attending high school. This too was incredibly motivating and became a part of who I am. I never went to my [college] graduation ceremony, so I never heard the commencement speeches. I know I missed out on some things, which is most likely why I tear up reading these speeches.”

Great note, Jim. Thanks. Your story reminds me a bit of Tom Brady’s. Getting drafted 199th overall, getting drafted after Spergon Wynn, were things that got burned into his brain, and they motivated him the way that teacher in sixth grade motivated you. We all find strength from slights. Good for you that you were able to parlay those slights into a good life.

10 Things I Think I Think

1. I think I owe major thanks to those who did my job for me while I was on vacation with these guest columns:

• June 13: Commencement speeches that resonated with me, led by Louis Riddick’s bet-on-yourself theme at Pitt.

• June 20: Al Michaels and Kirk Herbstreit on their Amazon Prime Thursday night marriage. Cool to see that Herbstreit’s a bit of an Al fanboy.

• June 27: NBC’s Paul Burmeister, voice of the USFL, with everything you need to know about the spring league’s first year.

• July 4: “Doc G,” a reformed compulsive gambler, on the danger of the omnipresent craziness of now-legalized sports gambling. Friends, this cautionary tale is important.

• July 11: Thirty FMIA readers, from Beaconsfield, England to Sachse, Texas, gave some thoughtful ideas about how to improve the NFL.

Thanks, all of you, for the thoughtful summer reading.

2. I think, assuming Deshaun Watson doesn’t play Week 1, the worst of the nine Sunday early-window games was Cleveland at Carolina … until July 6. The trade of Baker Mayfield to the Panthers that day, and the likelihood that Mayfield will win the starting quarterback job, makes Cleveland-Carolina must-see—at least for a few series. Imagine Mayfield’s motivation to shove it to the Browns that day. This trade makes sense to me. Despite what Carolina people said, they weren’t full of hope that Sam Darnold could be the long-term quarterback. And Mayfield for a season might show enough to earn a contract in Carolina. He’ll have to show a lot. Owner David Tepper doesn’t want to throw more millions at a quarterback without thinking the new guy has a chance to be the long-term guy.

3. I think I keep reading and hearing three words about Lamar Jackson and his stuck-in-cement contract talks or non-talks with the Ravens: Pay the man. I have four words in response: Play this season first. After Jackson’s injury-plagued 2021 season, I remain bugged by his postseason play. He’s 1-3 in four playoff games, with toothless losses to the Chargers (2018 season) and Titans (2019) at home. He’s led the Ravens to 17, 12, 20 and 3 points in those four games (13 points a game) with a 68.3 rating. Do you want to lock in Jackson at $46 million a year, or whatever, with that postseason Sword of Damacles hanging over Jackson? I don’t. Let him play this season out and judge his worth then.

4. I think Rob Gronkowski plays again.

5. I think this is the best line written about football in my time away. It comes from Sally Jenkins of the Washington Post, writing about Daniel Snyder’s ownership of the Washington Commanders, and the impression the franchise is giving when it props up Snyder as someone who has learned from his mistakes. Wrote Jenkins: “There’s never any such thing as a cleaned house as long as he’s still in it.”

6. I think Ann Killion wrote a very interesting column in the San Francisco Chronicle on Steph Curry eclipsing Joe Montana—in her eyes—as the pre-eminent Bay Area athlete of her writing career.

7. I think we can debate that for a long time. But her logic is pretty good. Writes Killion:

Like Montana, Curry revitalized a moribund, dysfunctional franchise. Like No. 16, No. 30 has brought four titles in less than a decade to the Bay Area. Like Montana, Curry is a multiple-time league MVP, a Hall of Fame lock, and now has won an MVP trophy of the championship. Like Montana, Curry won two championships with one of the greatest ever (Rice, Durant) but also two without that superstar.

Curry has changed the game. Montana also changed the NFL, but it was primarily due to his collaboration with Bill Walsh and the innovative offense they were able to execute together. Curry changed the NBA because of his unique skill set … He has revolutionized the sport.

Curry has vocal fans in every arena in the association. The NBA is a worldwide product and Curry is a global icon. Curry has made the world move. But mostly, he has made the Bay Area move. With joy, with celebration, with pride that he plays here.

8. I think it’s a mark of a good columnist, writing about Montana v. Curry, that the reader starts a column thinking: “She’s nuts. Montana’s one of the best quarterbacks of all time. No way Curry’s better.” But then you read, and you think, and whether you agree or disagree, you finish it thinking, “Ann Killion made her point, and it’s great logic.”

9. I think the classic exchange of Roger Goodell’s appearance before Congress (when Daniel Snyder tucked his tail and hid in his chickencrap no-show) happened when one of the Congressional committee members, Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), asked Goodell why Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports has been banned from NFL games. So apt, Jim Jordan sticking up for that esteemed journalist Dave Portnoy in a hearing that was supposed to be about the continuing debacle that is Daniel Snyder owning an NFL franchise. Jordan, Portnoy. Perfect together.

10. I think these are my other thoughts of the week:

a. Regarding the state of air travel in the United States, I learned a lot from Derek Thompson in The Atlantic, from a conversation he had with a travel expert.

b. Scott Keyes, of Scott’s Cheap Flights, told Thompson the root cause of the problems we’re seeing now is airlines trying to get lean and smart during Covid. They underestimated how ravenous the American public would be to fly again once the worst of the pandemic had passed. Said Keyes:

“Delta shed 30 percent of their employees—almost 30,000 people cut from their staff. American Airlines laid off 30 percent of their staff, through buyouts, early retirements, or otherwise. Airlines were trying to become as lean as possible to reduce those operating expenses with the anticipation that they were not going to be making much money.

“They assumed that this was going to be a six-year recovery period, not an 18-month recovery period. So when travel demand started rebounding much quicker than they anticipated, the airlines were caught flat-footed.”

c. Not satisfactory, but understandable.

d. I have the perfect illustration for all head coaches of the future to use when a team is floundering at midseason, and all seems lost, and there is no hope for a championship. On May 1, the Mississippi baseball team lost to Arkansas to fall to 8-14 in the Southeastern Conference. To this point, Ole Miss was 1-8 against Alabama, Tennessee and Arkansas. The team finished fifth in the seven-team SEC Western division. Eight weeks after that May 1 loss, Mississippi finished off a two-game sweep of Oklahoma to win the College World Series.

e. Kudos to Ole Miss. What a comeback, and what a story.

f. The Perfect Pushup Story of the Year: Christie Aschwanden of the New York Times on an exercise we should all do. This is the coolest fitness story. So simple, so important.

g. Radio Story of the Summer: Philip Connors, who works as a fire lookout in New Mexico, on what it’s like to watch so much of his beloved countryside burn, in a discussion with NPR. Sometimes it’s instructive to just listen to an eyewitness talk about what he sees as the face of America changes, acre by acre by acre. Connors, a writer by trade, is so good, so expressive. Listen to his voice:

At first, he thought of the lookout job as a paid writing retreat with good views. But over time he became a witness to the changes brought on by a warmer, drier climate.

“The place became my citadel and my solace. And it’s given me so much joy and beauty over the years,” he said. “Now it’s almost like the tables are turned, like it is in need of solace because big chunks of it are being transformed and going away.”

He notices the signs everywhere. At the highest elevations, the oldest conifers used to be snowed in through late March. Now there’s less snow, and the soil is drier.

When he hiked up the mountain for the first time this spring to open the tower, “with every footstep I was sending up little puffs of powder from the soil,” he said. “I had never seen that this time of year.”

Connors said the spruce, pine and fir forests at high elevations are vanishing from his part of the world.

h. We have to start paying more attention to what the thoughtful people seeing this destruction are telling us.

i. Eli Saslow is a Master Dept: The great Washington Post writer found the depravity and desperation of our society on bus route 15 in Denver. This poor 45-year-old bus driver, Suna Karabay, never signed up to be abused like this. She is on the front lines of homelessness, crime, the drug epidemic, the explosion of fentanyl, poverty and the breakdown of civil discourse. That’s a lot to cover. Writes Saslow:

Forty-five years old, she’d been driving the same route for nearly a decade, becoming such a fixture of Denver’s No. 15 bus line that her photograph was displayed on the side of several buses — a gigantic, smiling face of a city Suna no longer recognized in the aftermath of the pandemic. The Denver she encountered each day on the bus had been transformed by a new wave of epidemics overwhelming major cities across the country. Homelessness in Denver was up by as much as 50 percent since the beginning of the pandemic. Violent crime had increased by 17 percent, murders had gone up 47 percent, some types of property crime had nearly doubled, and seizures of fentanyl and methamphetamine had quadrupled in the past year.

She stopped the bus every few blocks to pick up more passengers in front of extended-stay motels and budget restaurants, shifting her eyes between the road ahead and the rearview mirror that showed all 70 seats behind her. In the past two years, Denver-area bus drivers had reported being assaulted by their passengers more than 145 times. Suna had been spit on, hit with a toolbox, threatened with a knife, pushed in the back while driving and chased into a restroom during her break. Her windshield had been shattered with rocks or glass bottles three times. After the most recent incident, she’d written to a supervisor that “this job now is like being a human stress ball.” Each day, she absorbed her passengers’ suffering and frustration during six trips up and down Colfax, until, by the end of the shift, she could see deep indentations of her fingers on the wheel.

j. Read to the end. It’s worth it. Painfully, it’s worth it.

k. Journalism Story of the Week: Jonathan Watts of The Guardian, on the scandal of two journalists who died trying to uncover the truth about the pillaging of the Brazilian rainforest.

l. Watts was a friend of the journalist, Dom Phillips. He wrote this story to bring attention to crimes none of us every see:

Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira have been killed in an undeclared global war against nature and the people who defend it. Their work mattered because our planet, the threats to it and the activities of those who threaten it matter. That work must be continued.

The frontlines of this war are the Earth’s remaining biodiverse regions – the forests, wetlands and oceans that are essential for the stability of our climate and planetary life-support system.

The integrity of these systems is under attack from organised crime and criminal governments who want to exploit timber, water and minerals for short-term, often illegal profits. In many regions, the only thing standing in their way is Indigenous communities and other traditional forest dwellers, supported by civil society organisations, conservation groups and academics.

My friend Dom knew how important this story was.

… The killings will chill journalists and editors covering the environmental frontline, but I hope it will inspire rather than deter. What happened to Dom and Bruno is not a one-off: it is part of a global trend. Over the past two decades, thousands of environment- and land-defenders have been killed worldwide. Brazil has been the most murderous country during that time. Some of the deaths cause a global storm, such as those of Chico Mendes, Dorothy Stang and now Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips, but most go under-reported and uninvestigated. If anything useful can come from the latest horror, let it be a recognition that these are not isolated cases. Let journalists examine the patterns that link these crimes, let us tell stories off the beaten track, and let us try to find solutions to the planet’s problems, as Dom was trying to do.

m. Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira are international heroes.

n. Cassidy Hutchinson is a national hero.

o. Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman are national heroes too.

p. The truth hurts sometimes. Actually, a lot of times in our recent history. Denying the truth doesn’t make the truth false. It makes those who deny the truth liars. Just another reason that journalism schools are more important now than ever.

q. Steph Curry is a national treasure. Just think: Aside from his clunker of a Game 5 against the Celtics, he made 31 of 62 threes in the other five games of the NBA Championship Series. He was more accurate from three-point range than two-, and almost all of those threes were contested.

r. Sue Bird is a treasure too. Good luck to her in her last season in the WNBA.

s. Now this is some content we could use today, from David Martin of CBS News, reporting on four Army veterans who served in Vietnam being awarded the Medal of Honor by the president. Just listen to the bravery in this piece. Wow.

t. Happy 80th birthday, Dick Shiner. Now there’s a blast from the past. Remember Shiner, who had a fairly undistinguished decade as a sometimes-starting quarterback in the NFL? Shiner’s claim to fame is that he was the Steelers’ quarterback in 1969, when he lost his last eight starts, paving the way for Pittsburgh’s marriage with Terry Bradshaw. Pittsburgh and Chicago tied for the worst records in the NFL at 1-13 in 1969, and in those days, ties in the draft order were broken by coin flips.

u. So, before the Super Bowl in New Orleans in January 1970, 18 days after the Steelers ended their desultory season with a 27-24 loss at New Orleans (Billy Kilmer outdueled Shiner that December day at Tulane Stadium), Ed McCaskey of the Bears and Art Rooney of the Steelers met in a New Orleans hotel ballroom. Pete Rozelle flipped a 1921 silver dollar in the air. “Heads,” McCaskey called. It came up tails. The Steelers got the first pick, and Bradshaw. The Bears traded the second pick—to Green Bay!—for Bob Hyland, Elijah Pitts and Lee Roy Caffey. Between them, that trio played a grand total of two seasons in Chicago. That was one heck of an important coin flip right there.

v. RIP James Caan. My enduring memory is how real he was in “The Godfather.” My favorite role of his was as the dying Bear Brian Piccolo in “Brian’s Song.” My winner for Underrated Role of James Caan’s life was as Will Ferrell’s dad in “Elf.” What an actor.

w. Fave Passage of the Summer: Bill Pennington of the New York Times on the crucial moment of the last hole at the U.S. Open, the tournament won by Matt Fitzpatrick with one terrific shot on hole 72:

The pivotal moment, as is common at major championships, arrived as Fitzpatrick stood on the final tee of the 72-hole, four-day tournament while leading by one stroke. Known for his meticulous precision — he has for many years charted the finite details and the outcome of every shot he hits in competition — Fitzpatrick had missed only two fairways to that point in his round.

But his 3-wood on the 444-yard, par-4 18th hole was ripped left and landed in the center of a yawning bunker just off the fairway. His ball was 156 yards from the hole, which was positioned on a plateaued green protected in the front by a cavernous bunker that has ruined many a golfer’s round for decades.

… He pulled a 9-iron from his bag and imagined he was a junior player again.

“I thought: try to hit it close,” Fitzpatrick said, smiling.

The shot soared over the perilous high lip of the bunker he was in and above the crest of the vast bunker guarding the 18th green.

“It was amazing to watch,” said Fitzpatrick, who knew at that instant that he would almost certainly make a par, which he did with two cautious putts.

MONTREAL — Top-ranked and defending champion Daniil Medvedev wasn’t bothered by the frustrating delays due to rain at the National Bank Open.

It’s one of the perks of his top ranking in men’s singles. Medvedev received a first-round bye as a top seed.

“I will have two good days of practice and after I’ll start the tournament,” he said. “Of course, I’m very hungry for victories.”

While many of his ATP Tour peers were stuck waiting to see when the rain would let up, the confident Russian star was able to relax knowing he only had to tinker with his training schedule.

Medvedev held court with reporters during a 15-minute availability before continuing preparations for his title defense.

He enters the competition on a roll after winning in Mexico over the weekend. Medvedev didn’t lose a set at the tournament en route to claiming his 14th career ATP-level crown.

“Feeling 100% physically (and I’m) mentally ready,” Medvedev said. “Really happy with Los Cabos for sure with the title. Looking forward to here, trying to get some good matches.”

Medvedev, who competes under a neutral flag, could face Australia’s Nick Kyrgios in the second round. Kyrgios, who jumped 26 spots to No. 37 in this week’s rankings following a victory at the Citi Open, was scheduled to open against Argentina’s Sebastian Baez.

World No. 9 Felix Auger-Aliassime of Montreal is one of many young stars who are seeded for the $6.53 million tournament. Others include Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz, Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece, Norway’s Casper Ruud and Italy’s Jannik Sinner.

Rafael Nadal withdrew on the eve of the tournament due to an abdominal injury. The rest of the so-called Big Three – Roger Federer (knee) and Novak Djokovic (unvaccinated) – were also absent.

“It doesn’t change much if they’re here or not because my goal is to win the tournament,” Medvedev said. “So no matter who I play . if it’s going to be a qualifier or wild card, lucky loser, second seed, I just want to win the match.”

Finland’s Emil Ruusuvuori defeated Switzerland’s Stan Wawrinka 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 in a match that began four hours after its originally scheduled start time.

In other early matches, American Jenson Brooksby beat Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan 6-2, 6-3 and Russia’s Karen Khachanov topped Argentina’s Francisco Cerundolo 7-6 (4), 5-7, 6-3. Alex Molcan of Slovakia defeated American Mackenzie McDonald 7-6 (1), 6-4.

Rain returned later and forced the suspension of all evening matches.

Australia’s Alex de Minaur had a 7-5, 6-6 lead on Canada’s Denis Shapovalov when the rain began. They had split the first six points of the tiebreaker.

Auger-Aliassime has a first-round bye as the No. 6 seed. Pospisil was slated to play his opening doubles match with Sinner, but it was rescheduled.

The singles field includes 41 of the top 44 players in the men’s rankings.

After an off-season like no other, one can almost guarantee that the 2022 NFL season will be unpredictable and it’s not just because of the overtime rule change for playoffs. The mayhem began with a game of musical chairs: quarterback edition. The Seattle Seahawks decided to start a rebuild after finishing the season with a 7-10 record, sending Russell Wilson to the Denver Broncos for 5 picks in the 2022 NFL Draft.

RELATED: Julian Edelman – A lot of guys got mad at Jimmy G not playing through pain in New England

The Washington Commanders initially tossed their hat in the ring for Wilson but were shut out and ended up acquiring QB Carson Wentz from the Indianapolis Colts for a pair of draft picks. Days later, the Cleveland Browns picked up Deshaun Watson from the Houston Texans. The Browns gave Watson a fully guaranteed 5-year, $230 million contract. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Falcons ended up trading long-time QB Matt Ryan, the starter since 2008, to the Colts for a 3rd-round pick after unsuccessfully pursuing Watson. Atlanta then signed Marcus Mariota to a two-year deal.

In the midst of all of the chaos, Ben Roethlisberger retired after an 18-year career with the Steelers, Tom Brady retired and then un-retired, and Aaron Rodgers decided to stay in Green Bay signing a 3-year, $150 million deal with the Packers.

There are still so many unanswered questions surrounding the upcoming 2022 NFL season. What will the status be for Deshaun Watson and the Browns once we get to September? Baker Mayfield has officially landed with the Carolina Panthers, where does that leave Jimmy Garoppolo? We witnessed Davante Adams, Tyreek Hill, Stefon Diggs, Terry McLaurin, and Deebo Samuel–five of the NFL’s best wide receivers–get paid this off-season, who will be next?

Notre Dame 99-to-0: No.","Notre Dame, Marcus Freeman and Tommy Rees may insist a quarterback competition is unfolding in the Irish preseason. Sophomore Tyler Buchner and junior Drew Pyne (pictured above) can wax poetically about the competition not impacting their close friendship. Everyone involved with Notre Dame can parrot the party line.

The Irish beat writers will not take that proverbial memo seriously.

“What you’ll see is Drew and Tyler battle it out,” Freeman said Friday. “They’ll both get reps with the ones and when myself and [offensive coordinator] Rees and the offensive staff feel it’s to a point where there’s a quarterback that’s clearly showed us that he’s the starter, we’ll name him.”

The beat writers feel it has gotten to a point where Buchner has clearly shown he’s the starter.

In the annual “Counting Down the Irish” series, 10 Irish beat writers — actually, this year, nine Irish beat writers and one media member who allows himself this one arena of overreactive fandom — offered their thoughts of who the top-25 most impactful Notre Dame players will be in 2022. The 10 ballots, in an intentionally subjective exercise, elevate Buchner far above Pyne.

That obviously may tie to Buchner’s mobility. It should give Rees more options in designing the Irish offense, something he cannot fully lean into until he knows who his primary passer will be.

“We know some of the things he can do because he showed it last year,” Rees said Saturday. “We want to continue to uncover some of the things, where we can go with all the quarterbacks. … I’m excited to unravel those pieces as camp continues on.”

After viewing just the first Notre Dame practice this fall, the press box’s presumptions were confirmed enough to knock Pyne well into the “Others Receiving Votes” category.

So, to be clear, he did receive votes. Three, to be exact, all as the No. 25 most impactful player of the Irish 2022. That was the exact voting distribution for Buchner a year ago. In that respect, Pyne is viewed as most backup quarterbacks are. In fact, he is far ahead of Phil Jurkovec’s preseason standing in 2019, when the No. 2 quarterback did not warrant a single vote.

Maybe Pyne would have curried a vote or two more if the ballots had not been due shortly after Saturday’s practices, as in interviews afterward, he revealed both a new look and a singular focus this August.

With a mustache that Tom Selleck would acknowledge and a haircut so short his teammates were shocked he paid for it, Pyne has leaned into the ethos of a football-obsessed quarterback.

“I’ve changed my mindset a little bit,” he said. “Coming into this camp and coming into this season, I’ve told myself to just be all business. I can’t let anything affect me outside of football. I can’t let anything in school, I can’t let anything with my friends, I can’t let my girlfriend, video games, anything. I want to be all business.”

Pyne said he spent 17 hours at the football facilities on Friday, catching the last shuttle for the team hotel before 10:00 bed checks. He has removed social media from his phone and, outside of football, talks to only his family and his girlfriend.

“I’m just trying to give everything I possibly can to the team because it deserves it,” he said. “We have a really good football team and there’s no reason for me or Tyler to put ourselves into anything else.”

Maybe that mentality will have an intangible impact that will deserve retroactive votes in this exercise. On the field, though, Pyne is still unexpected to see much action.

Thus, he falls among 10 others in “Others Receiving Votes.” The grouping is highlighted by a pair of freshmen and an unknown receiver, all three of which have already received praise after just one weekend of practices.

Others Receiving Votes:

Freshman receiver Tobias Merriweather — 27 points, five of 10 ballots, high of No. 11.

Sophomore receiver Jayden Thomas — 23 points, six ballots, high of No. 18.

Sixth-year right guard Josh Lugg — 23 points, four ballots, high of No. 16.

Freshman cornerback Jaden Mickey — 22 points, five ballots, high of No. 17.

Senior defensive tackle Jacob Lacey — 18 points, four ballots, high of No. 17.

Junior safety Ramon Henderson — 9 points, one ballot at No. 17.

Fifth-year safety DJ Brown — 8 points, three ballots, high of No. 22.

Junior quarterback Drew Pyne — 3 points, three ballots, all at No. 25.

Junior defensive end Jordan Botelho — 2 points, one ballot at No. 24.

Arkansas State transfer kicker Blake Grupe — 1 point.

Junior safety Xavier Watts – 1 point.

Rees heaped a high compliment on Merriweather on Saturday, one that featured Rees cutting the thought short so as not to be overly dramatic with the second half of his sentence.

“You see him, this kid’s got a chance,” Rees said, the rest of that sentence presumably being to be great. “It goes way deeper than that. He’s got an unbelievable work ethic. … He’s a kid that’s hungry for it, like he’s gonna do more.”

Merriweather is rooming with Pyne this August, and after Pyne’s 17 hours in the football facilities, he and Merriweather apparently quizzed each other on the next day’s practice after bed checks.

Thomas, meanwhile, is rooming with Buchner. Some time on the stationary bike worried observers on Saturday, but Rees said that was merely a precaution.

“JT’s done a great job,” Rees said. “He’s got to continue to be dependable and be available. I think he’s made big strides in terms of his development and his commitment to what we’re doing. I’m excited about the things he possesses.”

A starting offensive lineman falling out of the top 25 is hardly unprecedented, given it occurred last year with Zeke Correll, but at that time, Correll was not assured a starting role. Lugg is, making his exclusion from six ballots somewhat surprising. After all, he was ranked No. 19 a year ago, and he never lost his starting role. For what it’s worth, as the expected starter at center, Correll was still left off a couple ballots this year, as well.

The voters, generously giving of their time and insights in this annual exercise …

“But I’ve been here my whole life, and I love it.”RELATED READING: Notre Dame 99-to-0: No.","If you can’t stand the heat, get into the kitchen before the next practice. Or something like that.

Such was the thinking of Notre Dame head coach Marcus Freeman after the first preseason practice for the Irish on Friday. As Freeman memorably said in the viral video showcasing the uniforms Notre Dame will wear in the Shamrock Series against BYU on Oct. 8, he is not the players’ friend, he is their head coach. And the head coach understandably gets frustrated when two starting offensive linemen were not adequately prepared for the early August heat.

He minced no words for sophomore right tackle Blake Fisher and senior Zeke Correll, both ending the first practice sidelined due to overheating.

“It’s a great reminder, those guys have been busting their tails all summer to get in shape, and then you get out there that first practice — the heat, the sweat, the anxiety, the energy, it all just kicks up,” Freeman said Friday. “That’s why I remind them after practice, it’s your job to make sure you’re available. What you have to do from now until tomorrow when we’re back on the field, it’s up to you and it’s up to each individual to make sure they’re ready to go.”

As understandable as Freeman’s frustration was, it was also understandable that two players weighing 327 and 308 pounds, respectively, wore out in humid weather with temperatures in the upper 80s.

The more notable aspect of Correll’s fatigue was that he was part of Notre Dame’s starting offensive line. He spent the spring starting at center, but that was when a torn pectoral forced fifth-year offensive lineman Jarrett Patterson to the sideline. Patterson has started three seasons at center. Correll (No. 52 above) would have to force the issue to usurp the veteran.

And Correll did, moving Patterson to left guard in place of senior Andrew Kristofic. Correll began last season starting at left guard before giving way to Kristofic.

“We feel like right now, [Patterson] playing guard is what gives our offensive line the best chance to have success,” Freeman said. “You got to look at that unit in terms of all five, not in individual pieces. [Patterson] being at guard we feel like gives those five guys up front the best chance to be successful.”

To put that more directly, Correll proved he is one of the five best offensive linemen, and returned Irish offensive line coach Harry Hiestand has always prioritized finding a way to get those five on the field.

An alignment of, from left to right, sophomore Joe Alt, Patterson, Correll, sixth-year Josh Lugg and Fisher gives Hiestand those five.

Aside from those respites from the heat, little unavailability surprised Notre Dame to open preparations for the season. Freeman said only three players are already known as unavailable for the opener at Ohio State on Sept. 3: fifth-year receiver Joe Wilkins (Lisfranc), sophomore tight end Mitchell Evans (foot) and early-enrolled freshman running back Jadarian Price (Achilles).

Freeman left the door open for not only sixth-year receiver Avery Davis (ACL) and senior linebacker Marist Liufau (dislocated ankle last August) to play against the Buckeyes, but also sophomore running back Logan Diggs, who suffered a labrum injury in the Blue-Gold Game in April.

While Diggs wore a red jersey to keep him from contact in practice, Davis and Liufau were limited only via the number of reps they would take, not in the effort given on those reps.

QUARTERBACK ‘COMPETITION’

Freeman maintained a “two-quarterback battle right now” between sophomore Tyler Buchner and junior Drew Pyne, but Buchner reportedly took the bulk of the first-team snaps on Friday. Whether a nominal competition or a genuine one, Freeman intends to end it sooner than later.

“As soon as we can,” he said. “I love the competition aspect of it. I think competition really helps people grow, but as soon as we’re ready to name a starting quarterback, we’re going to do it.”

ON JOEY TANONA

Early-enrolled freshman offensive lineman Joey Tanona’s career ended before it began. He was in a car accident in the winter, riding as the passenger, and suffered a rough concussion that kept him out of the rest of spring practices.

In the spring, Hiestand was simply glad Tanona escaped with nothing worse than a concussion.

“It’s a blessing that he’s just dealing with what he’s dealing with — that it wasn’t worse,” Irish offensive line coach Harry Hiestand said. “That was a terrible accident. I saw pictures of the cars. Terrible, terrible, right where he was sitting.”

Nonetheless, the accident ended Tanona’s career, as he has medically retired, per Freeman.

“He kept trying to come back and, mentally and physically, was not in a place that he was ready to play football,” Freeman said. “So he decided to medically retire. He’ll still be here to get his degree.”

A former consensus four-star recruit, the Indiana native chose Notre Dame over offers from the biggest names in the Big Ten.

“A lot of people don’t like the state of Indiana, because it’s always cold and dark here,” he said in February. “But I’ve been here my whole life, and I love it.”

Notre Dame 99-to-0: No.","Notre Dame’s focus is on preseason practices and the 2022 season, now only four weeks away, but the Irish have added two 2023 recruits on the first two days of practice, nonetheless. Rivals.com three-star running back Dylan Edwards (Derby High School; Kan.) committed to Notre Dame on Saturday, joining rivals.com three-star safety Ben Minich (Lakota West High School; West Chester, Ohio), who pledged Friday.

The No. 10 running back in the class, per rivals.com, Edwards is rated a four-star by the other recruiting services, an honor that rivals.com Will Likely apply to him whenever it next updates its rankings.

He committed to Kansas State in mid-June over interest from Nebraska and Oklahoma. Then the 2021 Gatorade Player of the Year in Kansas ran a 4.38-second 40-yard dash at an Under Armour event in mid-July, and his recruitment took a turn. Schools with mild interest dialed that up, including Notre Dame.

An Under Armour All-American, Edwards visited South Bend at the end of July and subsequently de-committed from Kansas State. While Oregon chased him, as well, Edwards becomes the second running back in the Irish class, joining consensus four-star Jayden Limar (Lake Stevens H.S.; Wash.). Edwards also holds offers from Iowa State, Michigan State and Kentucky.

At 5-foot-9 and 165 pounds, most of his 2,603 rushing yards and 38total touchdowns in 2021 came from simply running away from opponents. Edwards’ highlight reel begins with a kickoff return for a touchdown in which he races past the coverage team.

That gig may be awaiting Edwards in 2023, with current junior running back Chris Tyree having handled kickoff returns last year and unlikely to for much longer given his offensive workload. If current sophomore receiver Lorenzo Styles steps into the role for now, that same reasoning could eventually move him away from it.

Behind Tyree, the Irish have a few young running backs: sophomores Logan Diggs and Audric Estime, and freshmen Jadarian Price and Gi'Bran Payne. But none of them provide the same breakaway speed component that Edwards does.

Scat backs — and at his size, Edwards certainly fits that description — are usually more shifty than fast, if not by much, but Edwards flips that. A hole through the defense does not need to be open long for him to be headed to the end zone through it.

“They want to get me the ball so that I can make moves and score,” Edwards said to Inside ND Sports. “That’s what coach (Marcus) Freeman and [offensive coordinator Tommy] Rees played in my head. When I get there, I am going to be a playmaker. I wouldn’t necessarily put a tag on one position. … It’s about me making plays.”

He avoids tackles more than runs through them, a luxury provided by the level of competition in Kansas, and something to wonder about come next August.

Next August, Edwards will be quite possibly trying to run through a tackle from Minich, who is also known for his speed.

A receiver and safety in high school, Minich has been clocked at less than 11 seconds in the 100-meter dash. If he ever picks off a pass on an out route, he will not be caught unless DK Metcalf happens to be on the field.

Notre Dame Recruiting Notre Dame beats LSU for four-star linebacker Jaiden Ausberry out of Baton... A third four-star receiver commitment, Jaden Greathouse, elevates Notre Dame’s... Notre Dame’s commitment-filled holiday weekend concludes with four-star...

At 6-foot-1 and 180 pounds, most of Minich’s power comes from his legs, which allows for surer tackling than that weight usually would suggest. His combination of speed and willingness to be physical should make him an early special teams contributor, though some added weight will be needed for more than that role.

Minich visited Cincinnati, Duke, Wake Forest and Notre Dame in June. The visit to South Bend was a camp, so the Irish coaching staff got an up-close look at him on the field. When a lower-ranked recruit commits following such a camp evaluation, it usually speaks to what the coaching staff was looking for and, apparently, found on its own campus.

Minich is the third safety in the Irish class, joining consensus four-stars Adon Shuler and Peyton Bowen.

The class, now at 23 commits, remains the No. 1 in 2023, per rivals.com.

72 Caleb Johnson, sophomore offensive tackle, former Auburn pledgeNo.","Listed measurements: 5-foot-11 ⅜, 182 pounds.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A fifth-year veteran, Lenzy has two seasons of eligibility remaining. In other words, he could conceivably return to Notre Dame for the 2023 season, as unlikely as that seems.

Depth Chart: For the number of criticisms that can be levied at Lenzy — more on them below — he has managed to stay available more often than not throughout his career, and right now that is vital for the Irish. Lenzy will start at Ohio State in 29 days. In years past, he fit best as the field (wide) receiver, but with sophomore Lorenzo Styles also in the mix, Lenzy may move around the formation.

Recruiting: Lenzy’s recruitment remains a lesson for fans on what not to do. A consensus four-star prospect, Lenzy de-committed from Notre Dame to instead head to his homestate Oregon with an understanding he could also run track for the historic Ducks program. Irish fans were not fans of that choice, and some made that known to Lenzy via social media.

When Oregon head coach Willie Taggart left to take the job at Florida State, Lenzy flipped back to Notre Dame. Ducks fans were not pleased with that choice, and some made that clear to Lenzy online.

His commitment came complete with a letter to those fans, all those who had criticized his choices as he plotted out his life, and if anything, it did not speak harshly enough to those loudmouths.

CAREER TO DATE

As available as Lenzy has been, he has also missed a number of games to concussions, nagging hamstring issues and then pandemic protocols. Missing nine games in his first two active seasons was not a great sign, but by current Notre Dame worries, that would be near full health.

When he did play, Lenzy shined in 2019, taking a total of 24 touches for 454 yards and four touchdowns. Hamstring troubles kept him from building on that momentum in 2020, but he was largely consistent in 2021. Lenzy caught at least one pass in every game except against Navy and had at least 21 receiving yards in nine games.

In the Fiesta Bowl, Lenzy was one of four receivers the Irish could trot out as quarterback Jack Coan dropped back to pass 70 times. Lenzy openly admitted to being gassed in the fourth quarter of that effort, as he caught seven passes for 60 yards.

2019: 9 games, 2 starts; 11 catches for 254 yards and two touchdowns with 13 rushes for 200 yards and two more scores.

2020: 7 games, 1 start; 7 catches for 63 yards and one touchdown with 3 rushes for 8 yards.

2021: 13 games, 11 starts; 32 catches for 350 yards and three touchdowns with 5 rushes for 69 yards.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Lenzy and sophomore receiver Lorenzo Styles recently signed a NIL deal with Under Armour and Dick’s Sporting Goods to push a cozy line of athletic apparel.

QUOTES

Lenzy’s health has been a mixed bag. He has never suffered a season-compromising injury like fifth-year receiver Joe Wilkins (Lisfranc) is worrying about right now or that cost sixth-year Avery Davis (ACL) the final month of 2021. But Lenzy has also never been the most durable. There was nothing Lenzy could do to avoid those early-career concussions, aside from not playing football at all, but plaguing hamstrings can be vaguely addressed in the offseason, as can an overall slight frame.

Lenzy has put on muscle, even if his current listed weight is up just one pound from this time a year ago.

Tommy Rees: “Can’t say enough good things about Braden Lenzy right now…His dependability right now is through the roof.” — Patrick Engel (@PatrickEngel_) April 9, 2022

Some of that improved strength was visible in Lenzy’s favorite route, a post corner that he could deploy more often in 2021. The route requires a cut back from momentum at about 135 degrees.

“It’s definitely tough,” Lenzy said to Jac Collinsworth on the ND on NBC Podcast in September. “I couldn’t really do it for a long time, or if I did it was inconsistent. It has become one of my better routes.

“I actually got one in the Wisconsin game. Avery caught one, too. I just think it’s so fun. … For me, it’s probably my most efficient, highest completion percentage catch.”

Jac also asked Lenzy what his favorite route is, a simple question we never ask these guys.

""Probably a post corner.""

Then @JacCollinsworth played it smooth, ""Explain what that is like I have no idea?""

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“It sounds simplistic, but it remains true: Lenzy’s success will come down to health. He has shown he can excel at the collegiate level. There are not enough quality cornerbacks on Notre Dame’s schedule to truly hamper him this season. Only his hamstrings can do that.

“The Irish do not need Lenzy to be a 50-catch receiver, or even a 40-catch receiver. His 2019 effectiveness would do plenty to worry opposing defenses on every snap.

“If Lenzy ends 2021 with literally two catches in every game, but one of them is always for at least 20 yards, it will mean Notre Dame’s offense found a gear it has lacked for a few years. That may sound meager, but it would be 25 catches for at least 300 yards and more likely closer to 450.

“Add in a few long touchdowns and Lenzy’s impact will gain more notoriety.

“Measuring expectations for Lenzy may not feel necessary given his talent is proven, but doing so may also measure his workload, which should then lead to more efficient usage. Lenzy’s snaps and targets should not be about quantity, but about quality. …

“From there, Lenzy can return in 2022 and add some more muscle to his frame to become a more consistent receiving option. He will never be a classic possession receiver, but that is also not his skill set, nor a common player in the NFL anymore.

“If Lenzy can prove healthy for an extended stretch, then the NFL will want to take a chance on him. Two years totaling 60-plus catches and 1,200 yards will get the NFL’s attention.”

2022 OUTLOOK

If last summer’s projection was accurate and Lenzy will put up 60 catches and 1,200 yards across the 2021 and 2022 seasons, then he owes 28 catches and 850 yards this year. Averaging 30.4 yards per catch would be otherworldly, but the 850 receiving yards would also be rather noteworthy. In the last five seasons, only three Irish receivers have topped that mark: Miles Boykin (872 in 2018), Chase Claypool (1,037 in 2019) and Kevin Austin (888 in 2021).

Lenzy reaching that many yards would be even more shocking considering he will be no higher than the No. 2 receiving option for Notre Dame this season, thanks to preseason All-American and rather-certain first-round draft pick tight end Michael Mayer.

The 28 catches, however, may be more underselling Lenzy’s potential this year.

Lenzy has taken 1,011 snaps in his career, and on 71 of them, the ball ended up in his hands. The math there is rather simple: On about 7 percent of the plays, Lenzy gets the ball.

The Irish have something resembling no receiver depth. While that may lead offensive coordinator Tommy Rees to slow down the game — Lenzy could run 70 routes in the bowl game after a month off; he could not do it on a weekly basis — Notre Dame should not fall too far off last year’s 903 offensive snaps. Lenzy should play three-quarters of them, as one of two stalwarts in the receiving corps along with Styles.

By that math, Lenzy will see about 600 plays. 7 percent of 600 is 42.

If Lenzy ends 2022 with 42 touches, he could surpass 600 yards from scrimmage. If that includes a handful of touchdowns, it will be a solid contribution.

And all of that does not boost any of Lenzy’s trends for supposed gained strength or simple maturity. Add those in and Lenzy could get that much closer to 1,000 yards from scrimmage. The Irish would be overjoyed with such.

DOWN THE ROAD

Lenzy’s speed may make him a mid-round draft pick. His recruitment was long ago by now, but anyone who could sprint for Oregon has the type of speed that entices some NFL front offices to make rash decisions.

If he gets through the 2022 season without missing a game, his durability worries will be far enough in the rearview mirror as to not make those franchises hesitate.

The NFL is on the verge of a run on young receivers, value available in their services while the top-10 receivers in the league make money not too far from what quarterbacks are usually paid. That will further strengthen Lenzy’s chances of getting drafted.

With 2022 health, do not expect Lenzy back in 2023.

When a college athlete gets pregnant, school officials can turn to a “pregnancy tool kit,” provided by the NCAA, where a simple flowchart lays out how to respond. After multiple positive pregnancy tests, the flowchart says, the athletic department should assemble a “decision-making team” of coaches, team doctors, athletic officials, family members, faith leaders and counselors. Then there is a choice, the flowchart says: The athlete can “elect to carry,” deliver the baby and eventually return to training after six to eight weeks. Or the athlete “elects to abort” and “returns to sport.” End of flowchart.

In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, leading to abortion bans in 20 states and threatening abortion access in many more, that choice may have disappeared for many athletes, including many elite athletes in top programs, according to data compiled by The Washington Post.

The moment feels urgent for some coaches and athletic directors in states where abortion access is threatened. In interviews, they said the overturning of Roe has left them with little information about how to advise the young people in whose lives and health decisions they are expected to play significant roles. Some worry about recruiting women athletes to states where their reproductive rights have been curtailed.

“No one’s talking about this yet, but it has the potential to be a real issue,” said Jacquie Joseph, assistant athletic director and former softball coach at Michigan State, where a 1931 ban on abortion is currently blocked by the state’s court. “We’re going to get there come this fall.”

But the end of Roe has been met with silence from most of the college sports world, including the NCAA. Inside athletic departments dominated by men, three female Division I coaches in states with abortion restrictions told The Post they were afraid to speak publicly in support of abortion rights, worried they could be targeted by their bosses, politicians or the public.

University of Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh, who is opposed to abortion, has been the only prominent college coach to speak about the issue. After he was quoted speaking at an antiabortion charity event this month, Harbaugh told ESPN that he saw abortion as an issue “that’s so big that it needs to be talked about. It needs serious conversation.”

Harbaugh said he would encourage Michigan players and staff members dealing with unplanned pregnancies to “go through with it.” If that person didn’t want to raise their child, Harbaugh said of himself and his wife, “Sarah and I will take that baby.”

Joseph said it wasn’t clear how it would be handled when a woman came into the athletic department with a pregnancy — or when a male athlete disclosed a pregnant partner.

“In the past, we’ve looked at pregnancy as health care — we’ve had women get pregnant, and we’ve had players have babies, and we’ve helped players make a different choice from a medical standpoint,” she said. “Now what are we going to do?”

The Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision has sparked confusion and anxiety on many college campuses, not just in sports. But as the NCAA spells out, coaches and other athletic department officials are involved in the lives and health care of college athletes in a way that gives the issue extra weight — and extra risk. College athletes are asked to waive privacy rights for some of their medical data, providing records to coaches, trainers and athletic departments.

“We’re intimately involved in their health decisions,” said a top athletic department official at a Division I school in a state with an abortion ban, who, fearing professional repercussions, spoke on the condition of anonymity. “It’s not like we make the decision, but we know about it. As an administrator, coach, athletic trainer — athletes have to disclose pregnancy because it’s going to impact their participation.”

“These conversations could come up, will come up, and there’s nothing I can say to them,” she said.

‘A full range of choices’

The NCAA’s “model policy for pregnant and parenting athletes” is 107 pages long, with detailed best practices that go far beyond the flowchart. There are statistics on the large numbers of athletes who are sexually active in college and case studies of pregnant athletes, including “worst-case scenarios” in which athletes felt forced to have abortions. A model dialogue lays out how athletic trainers “confronted with pregnancy” should interact with athletes, asking questions such as: “Is Coach aware of the situation? How do you feel about talking about it with her/him?”

The NCAA discourages athletic departments from requiring athletes to disclose pregnancies, saying they should create an environment that “encourages” athletes to reveal their pregnancies voluntarily instead. But it also permits athletic officials to report to team doctors or university representatives when they suspect an athlete is pregnant.

“A student-athlete should have a full range of choices,” the policy says, “including abortion or having the child, and withdrawing from or staying on the team.”

The organization did not put out a statement after the overturning of Roe — a contrast to last year, when many states sought to ban transgender athletes from competition. Though the number of transgender athletes participating in college sports remains low, the governing body put out a statement saying it “firmly and unequivocally supports” transgender athletes’ ability to compete.

In a recent statement to The Post, the organization said: “The NCAA continues to evaluate the potential impact of the Supreme Court’s abortion care decision on student-athletes. The implementation of student-athlete healthcare takes place at the local level, therefore each school should develop policies that support its student-athletes while complying with both state and federal laws.”

Some college coaches and officials told The Post that they were concerned by how little the end of Roe was spoken about, even after a leaked draft of the court’s opinion offered weeks of warning.

“It hasn’t been addressed at all in our athletic department,” said one Division I women’s soccer coach who’s in a state where abortion is now banned. When it comes to handling athlete pregnancies, she said: “I don’t think there’s enough information. If there is, I haven’t been able to find it.”

Access to that information is critical for any student. But advocates have painted abortion rights as especially vital for young athletes, whose chances at a college education or a professional career depend on their bodies — which are changed significantly by pregnancies.

“College athletes are front and center to this issue to the extent that, for many women, their athletic prowess is their ticket to higher education,” said Joanna Wright, a partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner who wrote an amicus brief opposing the overturning of Roe that was signed by hundreds of female athletes. “Athletic success is dependent on bodily integrity and the ability to hone and control your own body.”

A new calculation

In the wake of the Dobbs decision, as state lawmakers across the country scramble to erase or protect abortion rights, those rights are expected to be protected in 20 states and the District of Columbia. But the power centers of elite women’s college sports are disproportionately in states where abortion access is likely to be restricted or banned altogether.

Many of the country’s most popular and highly watched women’s college sports events are held in states with some of the strictest abortion laws. The Women’s College World Series, which peaked at 2.1 million viewers in this year’s final, is hosted every year in Oklahoma City; the gymnastics final, which drew more than 1 million viewers, has been held in Fort Worth since 2019. The next four Women’s Final Fours are set in states where restrictions are in place or expected.

According to data compiled by The Post, many elite women’s college sports programs are also disproportionately concentrated in states with abortion bans and expected bans or where the future of abortion rights is uncertain. It’s a dynamic that could restrict college choices for some top women’s athletes in the most popular sports.

In volleyball, just one of last season’s top 10 programs was in a state with abortion protections in place. In both women’s basketball and softball, just four of the top 25 programs were in states with abortion protections, and 15 were in states with abortion bans or where bans are likely. And in women’s soccer, where top programs are the main feeders into professional leagues, 11 of the top 25 programs are in states with bans or expected bans, and another seven are in states where the future of abortion is uncertain.

Sophie Adler left the D.C. area for Texas to play soccer at SMU, which is among the top 25 women’s programs. She graduated last year but said she questioned whether she would have made the same decision had Texas’s abortion ban been in effect.

“When you’re looking for where you’re going to spend the next four years, a big part of it is where you feel safe. I went to the campus of SMU, and I felt safe. But looking back now — I don’t know if it would have been the end-all-be-all for me, but I think it would have been an issue,” she said. “Would I have even looked in Texas? I don’t know.”

Some coaches said it was too early to tell whether abortion rights would affect where young women and other athletes attend college. But others said that as time went on, they expected that abortion restrictions would affect their schools’ ability to draw top women’s athletes.

“In terms of recruiting, I think it absolutely will make a difference,” said the athletic department official from a state with an abortion ban. At the private university where she works, she said: “The general student body here has enough money to get out of state if they need to. Our student-athletes don’t necessarily have that money. If they’re not thinking about it, they should be.”

‘This is a right’

Nell Fortner, a prominent women’s basketball coach who is now at Georgia Tech, said that in June, shortly after Roe was overturned, she found herself in an office with several of her youngest players and asked what they thought about the end of Roe. She discovered they knew nothing about it — or about Title IX, the 1972 civil rights law that was likely the reason they were able to play college sports.

“My biggest message with my kids here is that we as women had a fundamental right that’s been taken away from us,” Fortner said. “Whether you believe in it or not, whether you think it’s right or wrong, this is a lawful right that we do not have anymore.”

Title IX’s 50th anniversary, which was June 23, was celebrated across the sports world, with the NCAA, colleges and many professional teams marking the step toward equality. Roe, which would have celebrated its own 50th anniversary in January, was reversed June 24.

For some officials upset over the end of Roe, the contrast was clear. And it was linked, some said, to the stark gender imbalance among college sports leaders: 75 percent of NCAA coaches and athletic directors are men, according to NCAA data.

“It’s not lost on any of us that we celebrated Title IX and then the next day this came out,” the Division I athletic department official said. “You heard something from female figures in sports, but this is still a male-dominated industry, and we haven’t broken out of that, no matter how many people tell you it’s changing. A lot of males failed to even see the connection.”

Joseph, the assistant athletic director at Michigan State, hopes to get more college sports figures to care about Roe by framing the decision in terms of how it will affect the lives and careers of male athletes, too.

“There are going to be unplanned pregnancies,” Joseph said. “It does disproportionately impact women, but what are we going to do to hold the [men] accountable? Should he get to play when she doesn’t? If she’s forced to have a pregnancy, should he have a season? To me, that has to be part of it, too. This is an issue for both men and women.”

Randy Lane, the women’s gymnastics coach at Long Island, was one of only a few Division I coaches to speak up against the overturning of Roe, putting out a statement in June saying he was “horrified” by the decision.

“One out of every four women will have an abortion in her lifetime. That includes NCAA athletes,” Lane wrote. “You, as gymnasts, should have full control over your own bodies, choices, and health.”

Lane told The Post that he had been thinking about what to say since May, when the draft opinion was leaked, feeling a responsibility partly because of how the abuses of former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State doctor Larry Nassar tarnished his sport’s image.

“I was very certain I wanted to give a statement,” he said. “I cried several times thinking about not only my friends having this freedom taken away but all the women I coach, the women in my sport that I’ve recruited that don’t go to my school but go to a school in a state that doesn’t allow this.”

In gymnastics, which is among the most popular NCAA sports for women, more than half of the top 25 programs are in states with abortion bans, including four of the top five. Lane said he had little hope that the NCAA would make a statement about Roe, but he turned to other coaches and gymnastics leaders in hopes that they might choose to make statements of their own. Ultimately, he said, no one did.

At a coaches’ convention in May, Lane said: “I spoke to probably eight to 10 coaches. Once we got home, we stopped talking about it. I was hoping to get people to step up and make a statement, but it hasn’t happened for whatever reason. It’s at the point now where I’m thinking I’m going to send my statement again and say, ‘What are your thoughts?’ ”

“But I’ve been here my whole life, and I love it.”RELATED READING: Notre Dame 99-to-0: No.","If you can’t stand the heat, get into the kitchen before the next practice. Or something like that.

Such was the thinking of Notre Dame head coach Marcus Freeman after the first preseason practice for the Irish on Friday. As Freeman memorably said in the viral video showcasing the uniforms Notre Dame will wear in the Shamrock Series against BYU on Oct. 8, he is not the players’ friend, he is their head coach. And the head coach understandably gets frustrated when two starting offensive linemen were not adequately prepared for the early August heat.

He minced no words for sophomore right tackle Blake Fisher and senior Zeke Correll, both ending the first practice sidelined due to overheating.

“It’s a great reminder, those guys have been busting their tails all summer to get in shape, and then you get out there that first practice — the heat, the sweat, the anxiety, the energy, it all just kicks up,” Freeman said Friday. “That’s why I remind them after practice, it’s your job to make sure you’re available. What you have to do from now until tomorrow when we’re back on the field, it’s up to you and it’s up to each individual to make sure they’re ready to go.”

As understandable as Freeman’s frustration was, it was also understandable that two players weighing 327 and 308 pounds, respectively, wore out in humid weather with temperatures in the upper 80s.

The more notable aspect of Correll’s fatigue was that he was part of Notre Dame’s starting offensive line. He spent the spring starting at center, but that was when a torn pectoral forced fifth-year offensive lineman Jarrett Patterson to the sideline. Patterson has started three seasons at center. Correll (No. 52 above) would have to force the issue to usurp the veteran.

And Correll did, moving Patterson to left guard in place of senior Andrew Kristofic. Correll began last season starting at left guard before giving way to Kristofic.

“We feel like right now, [Patterson] playing guard is what gives our offensive line the best chance to have success,” Freeman said. “You got to look at that unit in terms of all five, not in individual pieces. [Patterson] being at guard we feel like gives those five guys up front the best chance to be successful.”

To put that more directly, Correll proved he is one of the five best offensive linemen, and returned Irish offensive line coach Harry Hiestand has always prioritized finding a way to get those five on the field.

An alignment of, from left to right, sophomore Joe Alt, Patterson, Correll, sixth-year Josh Lugg and Fisher gives Hiestand those five.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s... Notre Dame 99-to-0: No. 0 Braden Lenzy, fifth-year receiver, one of few healthy...

Aside from those respites from the heat, little unavailability surprised Notre Dame to open preparations for the season. Freeman said only three players are already known as unavailable for the opener at Ohio State on Sept. 3: fifth-year receiver Joe Wilkins (Lisfranc), sophomore tight end Mitchell Evans (foot) and early-enrolled freshman running back Jadarian Price (Achilles).

Freeman left the door open for not only sixth-year receiver Avery Davis (ACL) and senior linebacker Marist Liufau (dislocated ankle last August) to play against the Buckeyes, but also sophomore running back Logan Diggs, who suffered a labrum injury in the Blue-Gold Game in April.

While Diggs wore a red jersey to keep him from contact in practice, Davis and Liufau were limited only via the number of reps they would take, not in the effort given on those reps.

QUARTERBACK ‘COMPETITION’

Freeman maintained a “two-quarterback battle right now” between sophomore Tyler Buchner and junior Drew Pyne, but Buchner reportedly took the bulk of the first-team snaps on Friday. Whether a nominal competition or a genuine one, Freeman intends to end it sooner than later.

“As soon as we can,” he said. “I love the competition aspect of it. I think competition really helps people grow, but as soon as we’re ready to name a starting quarterback, we’re going to do it.”

ON JOEY TANONA

Early-enrolled freshman offensive lineman Joey Tanona’s career ended before it began. He was in a car accident in the winter, riding as the passenger, and suffered a rough concussion that kept him out of the rest of spring practices.

In the spring, Hiestand was simply glad Tanona escaped with nothing worse than a concussion.

“It’s a blessing that he’s just dealing with what he’s dealing with — that it wasn’t worse,” Irish offensive line coach Harry Hiestand said. “That was a terrible accident. I saw pictures of the cars. Terrible, terrible, right where he was sitting.”

Nonetheless, the accident ended Tanona’s career, as he has medically retired, per Freeman.

“He kept trying to come back and, mentally and physically, was not in a place that he was ready to play football,” Freeman said. “So he decided to medically retire. He’ll still be here to get his degree.”

A former consensus four-star recruit, the Indiana native chose Notre Dame over offers from the biggest names in the Big Ten.

“A lot of people don’t like the state of Indiana, because it’s always cold and dark here,” he said in February. “But I’ve been here my whole life, and I love it.”

Depth Chart: Tanona will fall short of Notre Dame’s two-deep this fall no matter how the starting guards situation works out.

Recruiting: The first commit in the Irish class of 2022 — announcing that decision nearly two years ago now — the All-American and consensus four-star chose Notre Dame despite offers from the biggest names in the Big Ten, LSU and Arizona State. Rivals.com considered Tanona the No. 9 guard in the class and No. 178 overall player.

“I would say it was a pretty easy decision,” Tanona said in February. “It’s just a special place here, and there’s no place I’d rather be.”

Coming from Zionsville, Ind. — a town of about 30,000 people just north of Indianapolis — Tanona distinctly wanted to stay close to home.

“A lot of people don’t like the state of Indiana, because it’s always cold and dark here,” he said. “But I’ve been here my whole life, and I love it.”

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Tanona’s Indiana tourism pitch could use some work. Instead …

This one includes a personal emphasis. On his way to a workout, riding as the passenger, Tanona was in a car accident this spring. He suffered a rough concussion, to the degree that it kept him out for the rest of spring practices, but that was the worst injury suffered in what was apparently a decently ugly accident.

“It’s a blessing that he’s just dealing with what he’s dealing with — that it wasn’t worse,” Irish offensive line coach Harry Hiestand said. “That was a terrible accident. I saw pictures of the cars. Terrible, terrible, right where he was sitting.”

This space went quiet for a few days last fall when this reporter’s truck suffered a steering column failure and yanked into the wall along the interstate while going 70-plus miles an hour. The previously indestructible Ford Ranger was totaled, but I walked away with nothing worse than a bruised wrist and a sore shoulder.

Public service announcements do not pay much, but Tanona would be uniquely positioned to remind folks of the wonders that are seat belts and airbags. In 1982, neither Tanona nor I walk away from those accidents in one piece.

Wear your seatbelts, y’all. No exceptions.

QUOTES

Of course, missing spring practices as an early enrollee must have been particularly frustrating. Tanona had skipped the conclusion of his high school life to get a headstart physically and academically, and the more tangible half of that was abruptly scrapped.

Notre Dame head coach Marcus Freeman kept that in perspective.

“It was a pretty bad [concussion], so I think he’s very slowly starting to get back into physical work,” Freeman said in April. “But these young kids are supposed to be in high school now, so we’re taking our time and making sure we’re waiting for his mind and body to be right.”

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN TANONA SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“Tanona [is a] respected mauler in the run game, suggesting [he ends] up at guard down the line.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Get healthy. Get in the weight room. Work on the scout team.

Not much else needs to be said for Tanona. It would be a relative shock to see him play at all in 2022, even in mop-up time. The Irish have sophomore Rocco Spindler and early-enrolled freshman Billy Schrauth to work into those snaps so they are ready if absolutely needed this season. Tanona may be the same year as Schrauth, but even before the concussion, there was an expected gap between the two.

DOWN THE ROAD

Turnover is coming for Notre Dame’s offensive line, if slowly. The odds are the Irish will lose at least four of their 2022 starters by the 2024 season. That will lead to uncertainty and shuffling in years to come, moments that could come to Tanona’s benefit.

He already has decent size and proven abilities in the weight room. Some time spent under Hiestand’s tutelage should thus prepare Tanona for a contributing role in 2024, when he will be only a junior with three seasons of eligibility remaining.

Spindler and Schrauth will still be around, but with so many starting positions up for grabs, Hiestand’s mandate of getting the five best linemen on the field no matter their alignment will allow for some positional flexibility.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Notre Dame 99-to-0: No.","Notre Dame’s focus is on preseason practices and the 2022 season, now only four weeks away, but the Irish have added two 2023 recruits on the first two days of practice, nonetheless. Rivals.com three-star running back Dylan Edwards (Derby High School; Kan.) committed to Notre Dame on Saturday, joining rivals.com three-star safety Ben Minich (Lakota West High School; West Chester, Ohio), who pledged Friday.

The No. 10 running back in the class, per rivals.com, Edwards is rated a four-star by the other recruiting services, an honor that rivals.com Will Likely apply to him whenever it next updates its rankings.

He committed to Kansas State in mid-June over interest from Nebraska and Oklahoma. Then the 2021 Gatorade Player of the Year in Kansas ran a 4.38-second 40-yard dash at an Under Armour event in mid-July, and his recruitment took a turn. Schools with mild interest dialed that up, including Notre Dame.

An Under Armour All-American, Edwards visited South Bend at the end of July and subsequently de-committed from Kansas State. While Oregon chased him, as well, Edwards becomes the second running back in the Irish class, joining consensus four-star Jayden Limar (Lake Stevens H.S.; Wash.). Edwards also holds offers from Iowa State, Michigan State and Kentucky.

At 5-foot-9 and 165 pounds, most of his 2,603 rushing yards and 38total touchdowns in 2021 came from simply running away from opponents. Edwards’ highlight reel begins with a kickoff return for a touchdown in which he races past the coverage team.

That gig may be awaiting Edwards in 2023, with current junior running back Chris Tyree having handled kickoff returns last year and unlikely to for much longer given his offensive workload. If current sophomore receiver Lorenzo Styles steps into the role for now, that same reasoning could eventually move him away from it.

Behind Tyree, the Irish have a few young running backs: sophomores Logan Diggs and Audric Estime, and freshmen Jadarian Price and Gi'Bran Payne. But none of them provide the same breakaway speed component that Edwards does.

Scat backs — and at his size, Edwards certainly fits that description — are usually more shifty than fast, if not by much, but Edwards flips that. A hole through the defense does not need to be open long for him to be headed to the end zone through it.

“They want to get me the ball so that I can make moves and score,” Edwards said to Inside ND Sports. “That’s what coach (Marcus) Freeman and [offensive coordinator Tommy] Rees played in my head. When I get there, I am going to be a playmaker. I wouldn’t necessarily put a tag on one position. … It’s about me making plays.”

He avoids tackles more than runs through them, a luxury provided by the level of competition in Kansas, and something to wonder about come next August.

Next August, Edwards will be quite possibly trying to run through a tackle from Minich, who is also known for his speed.

A receiver and safety in high school, Minich has been clocked at less than 11 seconds in the 100-meter dash. If he ever picks off a pass on an out route, he will not be caught unless DK Metcalf happens to be on the field.

At 6-foot-1 and 180 pounds, most of Minich’s power comes from his legs, which allows for surer tackling than that weight usually would suggest. His combination of speed and willingness to be physical should make him an early special teams contributor, though some added weight will be needed for more than that role.

Minich visited Cincinnati, Duke, Wake Forest and Notre Dame in June. The visit to South Bend was a camp, so the Irish coaching staff got an up-close look at him on the field. When a lower-ranked recruit commits following such a camp evaluation, it usually speaks to what the coaching staff was looking for and, apparently, found on its own campus.

Minich is the third safety in the Irish class, joining consensus four-stars Adon Shuler and Peyton Bowen.

The class, now at 23 commits, remains the No. 1 in 2023, per rivals.com.

Less a sign of concern, it was a tea leaf for what would come Thursday evening when four-star running back Jayden Limar (Lake Stevens High School; Wash.) replaced Irvin in the Irish class.

Considered the No. 11 running back in the class of 2023, Irvin committed to Notre Dame in September. Limar comes in as the No. 12 back in the class and the No. 241 overall prospect. Suddenly the Irish appear to have their pick of notable running back recruits, a luxury few programs know.

Limar chose Notre Dame over finalists Arizona, Michigan and Oregon while also holding scholarship offers from USC, Washington and Texas A&M.

At 5-foot-11 and 181 pounds, Limar is far from a bruising back, but he is not easily tackled. His highlights do not include a bounty of broken tackles in traffic, but that is probably more a reflection of opposing talent in the state of Washington than of an inherent weakness.

Limar’s ability to turn his hips in traffic makes it difficult for a defender to get his arms around the ball carrier. Consider that a specific form of shiftiness.

He has good hands coming out of the backfield, frequently targeted on screens in his junior season. With that running start, he is able to showcase his moderate speed, noticeable but not necessarily blazing. Limar will not often be caught from behind, but if a defender has a decent angle on him, Limar will not outrun geometry.

That shiftiness and ability to provide a quarterback a safety valve made for a few Thursday comparisons to former Irish running back Kyren Williams. If nothing else, a sub-6-foot running back with a rapid stride certainly evokes those memories.

Williams excelled for Notre Dame on third downs, able to run, catch or pass block. Limar said Irish running backs coach Deland McCullough already envisions such a role for him.

“He has his every-down back, third-down back and long-play back,” Limar said to Inside ND Sports. “He sees me being a good third-down back coming in. He wants me involved. They are not going to redshirt me. They want me to play as much as I am ready for my freshman season. He was adamant about getting me to play my freshman year.”

While those roles may be interchangeable, it would be logical to assume current junior Chris Tyree is the “long-play back” Limar mentioned. Sophomore Logan Diggs may be the every-down back, and if that version of “third-down back” is shorthand for third-and-short, that could be a reference to sophomore Audric Estime.

But among them, no one has yet presented as the triple-threat that Williams was.

Limar is the 13th commit in the Irish class, a class ranked as the best in the country by rivals.com. It is still too early in the cycle to consider that as notable praise, but with the 2022 season just three months away — and most recruiting slows during the high school season as players focus on the task immediately in front of them — that disclaimer will not be valid for much longer.

Limar is only the third skill position player in the class, joining consensus four-star tight end Cooper Flanagan and consensus four-star receiver Braylon James.

On Saturday, three-star recruit Dylan Edwards announced his Notre Dame commitment. The Derby (Kan.) High running back is the third Irish commit in three days, 23rd overall in the 2023 class, and marks another with elite speed. Earlier this week, Notre Dame garnered pledges from four-star linebacker Jaiden Ausberry and three-star athlete Ben Minich. Notre Dame's latest commit, Edwards, was initially committed to Kansas State. But once the Irish entered the mix last week, it changed the outlook of his recruitment. Notre Dame's academic excellence and player development led to him decommitting from the Wildcats, and his familiarity with McCullough quickly sealed the deal for the Irish. ""Having someone that I could lean on there, I couldn't pass that up,"" Edwards told Inside ND Sports before making his commitment public. ""Why not Notre Dame? They're a big centerpiece of college football. Everybody wants to play for Notre Dame."" Rivals ranks Edwards as the No. 10 all-purpose back nationally and No. 3 prospect in Kansas in the 2023 class. But because he is not one of Notre Dame's top 20 commits, his pledge did not have any effect on the Rivals team recruiting rankings. The Irish remain in first place with a 200-point lead over Alabama.

Edwards reported his ND offer July 27, 11 days after running a laser-timed, 4.38-second 40-yard dash at the Under Armour Future 50. That sprint also registered a speed of 22.9 mph on the Catapult GPS system at the camp, which took place at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla. It sparked interest from several college teams, including Notre Dame. ""My phone blew up after that camp,"" Edwards said. ""It was so unexpected because I was committed. I didn't plan on decommitting, but things happen. So at that time, Notre Dame really wanted to pull the trigger on me, and that's what happened."" The 5-foot-9, 165-pounder visited Notre Dame the day after it extended a scholarship offer — a trip that sparked the eventual decommitment from the Kansas State legacy one week ago. Edwards first visited Notre Dame last summer as an unoffered prospect. But the Irish targeted Edwards this summer amidst uncertainty with other recruits.

In the 2023 class, Notre Dame remains among the top suitors for four-star targets Jeremiyah Love and Ronan Hanafin. While Love and Hanafin took official visits to Notre Dame in June, both recruits have other attractive options elsewhere. Edwards' offensive versatility keeps the door open for Love to still come to Notre Dame as a running back/wide receiver and Hanafin to play wide receiver or safety if he opts for the Irish. In addition, the Irish still have in the fold four-star running back Jayden Limar, who can also produce as a pass-catching back. While adding a weapon like Edwards to the Irish offense wasn't part of Notre Dame's early recruiting plan, it has home run potential. ""He has real good vision and balance,"" said Prep Football Report recruiting analyst Tom Lemming. ""He's stronger than he looks. He's the kind of guy when he comes to Notre Dame, and if they find ways to get him in space, he'll be an electric player. To me, it's a no-brainer. He'll be an exciting player."" As a junior, Edwards rushed for 2,603 yards on 208 carries (12.5 yards per carry) and 38 touchdowns in 12 games. Although he had limited involvement in the passing game, Edwards did catch eight passes for 101 yards (12.6 yards per catch) and a touchdown. He also took two punts and a kickoff to the end zone. At Notre Dame, Edwards intends to keep playing multiple positions. ""'They want to get me the ball so that I can make moves and score,"" he said. ""That's what coach Freeman and coach Rees played in my head. When I get there, I am going to be a playmaker. I wouldn't necessarily put a tag on one position. ... It's about me making plays."""

Few things pertaining to the Irish should be framed in reference to their former head coach, but it is hard to do otherwise in this case after consensus four-star linebacker Jaiden Ausberry (University Laboratory School; Baton Rouge, La.) committed to Notre Dame on Thursday.

Ausberry listed seven finalists in his recruitment, but it likely came down to the Irish and Tigers, despite Alabama, Michigan and Texas A&M being among those seven.

The No. 80 overall prospect in the class and No. 4 outside linebacker, per rivals.com, Ausberry is considered the No. 7 player in Louisiana. He focused his official recruiting visits in June, touring Auburn, Michigan, Texas A&M and Notre Dame.

At 6-foot-2 and 210 pounds, Ausberry is a fast and decisive player. Taking notes of his highlight reel, those two adjectives are scribbled down multiple times. He aggressively chases quarterbacks who dare roll out of the pocket, and while that may burn him in college if not done with discipline, it further underscores his decisive play.

Ausberry is long enough to get his arms around a ball carrier as quickly as his chest hits him. That fast style will presumably need to be fine-tuned in coverage, but that is to be expected of nearly all high school linebackers.

The 21st commitment in the class for the Irish, Ausberry keeps Notre Dame’s class ranked No. 1 in the country by rivals.com. Alabama and Ohio State are ranked Nos. 2 and 3, respectively, with only 18 recruits apiece, so the Irish may not remain atop the rankings into December’s early signing period, but simply competing with the best programs in the country should be the primary recruiting goal. (Especially since recruiting rankings can be misleading as soon as a program needs to add a specialist to its ledger, as one example.)

Notre Dame Recruiting Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s... A third four-star receiver commitment, Jaden Greathouse, elevates Notre Dame’s... Notre Dame’s commitment-filled holiday weekend concludes with four-star...

Ausberry is the third linebacker in the class for Notre Dame, joining consensus four-star Preston Zinter (Central Catholic High School; Lawrence, Mass.) and consensus four-star Drayk Bowen (Andrean H.S.; Merrillville, Ind.).

After Irish head coach Marcus Freeman — defensive coordinator for the vast majority of the recruiting cycle for the class of 2022 — pulled in a quartet of four-star linebackers in the current freshman class (though one has already moved to defensive end), the 2023 trio will add talented depth for Notre Dame’s defense.

Stockpiling positions in back-to-back classes like that is how programs like Alabama and Ohio State develop depth the rest of the country envies.

The Irish added a third four-star receiver with Friday’s commitment from consensus four-star Jaden Greathouse (Westlake High School; Austin, Texas).

The No. 9 receiver in the class and No. 69 prospect overall, per rivals.com, Greathouse chose Notre Dame over other finalists South Carolina, Oklahoma and his homestate flagship Texas.

At 6-foot-1 and 210 pounds, he has a strong center of gravity, allowing him both balance and explosiveness. Hence, a 2021 stat line of 66 catches for 1,274 yards and 20 touchdowns was hardly a surprise.

Greathouse catches more than his fair share of jump balls, with some credit for that tying to his time on the basketball court. For that matter, he does not have the height to further pursue basketball, but Greathouse’s broad shoulders evoke thoughts of a power forward more than they do of a receiver. In football terms, that becomes a difficult frame for a defender to come around to break up a pass.

Greathouse’s quick acceleration helps not only in getting downfield but also in getting out of breaks efficiently, complementing his sharp route-running. He may already be a more complete receiver than most such recruits, a backhanded compliment of sorts as it is a result of him not having simple height to rely on or raw sprinter’s speed.

Joining No. 17 receiver in the class Rico Flores (Folsom H.S.; Calif) and No. 31 Braylon James (Del Valle; Texas), Greathouse gives Notre Dame a pass-catching class better than any in recent decades.

Of course, those players have to stick with their pledges until December, a problem for the Irish last cycle, but having the No. 1 recruiting class in the country, to date, strengthens the counters to that worry.

In Braylon James, Jaden Greathouse and Rico Flores Jr., the Irish have three Top 200 overall prospects committed at wide out. That is a first for Notre Dame in the Rivals/247 era, dating back to 2000. — Pete Sampson (@PeteSampson_) July 15, 2022

The No. 20 commit in the class for Notre Dame, Greathouse should have a quick avenue to playing time, in part because only Tobias Merriweather joined the Irish receivers in the class of 2022. As fifth-years Braden Lenzy and Joe Wilkins and sixth-year Avery Davis matriculate from the program, Notre Dame will be down to only a trio of current sophomores and Merriweather. Based on simple math, two of these three commitments should be in the Irish two-deep as freshmen.

The latter is a hypothetical; the former is very much a reality Notre Dame is enjoying after pulling in a fourth class of 2023 commitment today with a Monday afternoon pledge from consensus four-star cornerback Christian Gray (De Smet Jesuit High School; St. Louis).

The No. 8 cornerback and No. 51 overall prospect in the class, per rivals.com, Gray narrowed his choices down to the Irish, LSU, Ohio State and USC before picking Notre Dame. He visited Baton Rouge and South Bend in back-to-back June weekends as part of his decision process, a process that did not heavily consider scholarship offers from Alabama, Florida and Gray’s homestate Missouri.

Standing 6-foot tall, Gray’s best asset may be his 75.25-inch reported wingspan. Those long arms not only help break up passes, but they also make him that much more effective in press coverage, hassling receivers at the line of scrimmage. Further, they allow him a margin of error in downfield coverage, able to contest a pass no matter how the receiver may attempt to box him out.

Gray returns kicks and punts in high school, though it is hard to predict if that will be among his responsibilities at the next level — as much dependent on who is among the other 84 players on the roster as it is on Gray’s abilities. At the least, his returning experience suggests any interceptions he snags may be ripe for further playmaking.

Gray’s highlight reel does not include a litany of tackles, an ability rarely spurring a cornerback’s recruitment. At only 174 pounds, squaring up a running back may be a worry until Gray adds some weight, but only so much weight can be put onto a cornerback’s frame without losing the needed agility.

He is the second cornerback in Notre Dame’s class of 2023, joining consensus four-star Micah Bell (The Kinkaid School; Houston) from Friday. They will find a young position group when they get to South Bend. Fifth-year nickel back Tariq Bracy is entering his final season, and junior Clarence Lewis and senior Cam Hart each have three years of eligibility remaining. But after them, Notre Dame has six cornerbacks currently on the roster who have not used any eligibility.

Following Bell’s commitment on Friday, consensus four-star receiver Rico Flores Jr. (Folsom H.S.; Calif.) hopped into the class on Sunday. At that point, the Irish climbed to the No. 1 spot in the team rankings in the class of 2023, per rivals.com. Ohio State is the only close competition at the moment, with one fewer commitment thus far. (Gray is Notre Dame’s 19th in the class.)

While many national powers have not yet ramped up in this class — Georgia has 12 recruits committed, USC has 11 and Alabama has just nine — even as they do, the 19 Irish commits include 18 four- or five-stars. If every one of those national powers leapfrogs Notre Dame, first-year head coach Marcus Freeman’s debut class should still finish in the top-five in the country, and that was a notable “if.”

The Irish class lacks enough receivers given Notre Dame’s roster issues at the position, and the class still lacks a quarterback. Freeman would probably like to add a linebacker or two to the pair already pledged.

It is not a complete group, but it is an increasingly impressive one, nonetheless.

The recruiting class of 2023 standing at No.","Notre Dame could have signed more recruits this week to wrap up its class of 2022, but instead, the Irish finished the cycle with the 21 players they signed in December. Though an offensive skill player or two popped up in the following six weeks, the reality is Notre Dame had moved onto 2023 as soon as Marcus Freeman touched base with all the offensive prospects in the brief stretch between his hiring and the early signing period.

On some of those visits, he even found time to visit with 2023 recruits already.

“When you’re going to go to an area to see a 2022 (prospect), you might as well get the work in on the guys in that area,” then-Irish recruiting coordinator Mike Elston said in December. “… We didn’t want to lose momentum in the ‘23 and the ‘24 class with where we were right now. So it’s just about looking to the future and making sure that we secure that.”

In some instances, the 2023 possibilities may be the answers to current roster questions. If a position has adequate depth at the moment but should be shored up down the line — having only one underclassman safety comes to mind — Notre Dame may forgo an influx of transfer portal imports and instead focus on that need this recruiting cycle.

“If we need to start recruiting more high school kids for the following ‘23 class, we will,” Freeman said in December. “Those are still something that’s an ongoing process in terms of our current roster, in terms of guys leaving.”

The Irish are off to an astounding start in 2023 recruiting, both in terms of quantity and quality. Eight verbal commitments at this point in the cycle is ahead of the usual pace — four in the 2020 cycle when the 2019 class concluded; six in the 2021 cycle; five in the 2022 cycle — and all eight are consensus four-star prospects.

In order of their commitment, from first to most recent …

DEFENSIVE END Keon Keeley — Elston has renewed his pursuit of Keeley now that hte defensive line coach is at Michigan, which should only speak to Keeley’s standing. The No. 2 weakside defensive end in the class and No. 26 prospect overall, per rivals.com, Keeley could end up a five-star recruit within the next year.

DEFENSIVE END BRENAN VERNON — Elston has not been as devoted in renewing his chase of Vernon, the No. 14 overall prospect in the class. Perhaps that speaks to the strength of Vernon’s commitment, and if so, the Ohio recruit certainly should be the piece that breaks Notre Dame’s five-star drought.

DEFENSIVE BACK ADON SHULER — A New Jersey recruit, Shuler was the last defender in the class to commit to the Irish before Freeman coached even a single game as Notre Dame’s defensive coordinator, speaking to the off-field impact Freeman made in recruiting. Shuler works at safety in high school, possibly part of the fix to the aforementioned depth problem coming at the position for the Irish.

TIGHT END COOPER FLANAGAN — The No. 19 tight end in the class, Flanagan boasts a 6-foot-6 frame, the type of height that has proven to be a boon for modern tight ends.

RUNNING BACK SEDRICK IRVIN — Notre Dame briefly considered adding a second running back in the 2022 class, so it should not be assumed Irvin will be the only back sought in 2023, but as the No. 12 running back in the class, he might be up to that task on his own, anyway.

LINEBACKER Drayk Bowen — The No. 32 player in the country, Bowen continues the linebacker recruiting hot streak from Freeman, after signing the best quartet in the country in December. An Indiana native, Bowen’s commitment feels more stable than anyone else’s at this point in a cycle, especially given he has visited Notre Dame five times in the last eight months.

DEFENSIVE BACK JUSTYN RHETT — A cornerback, Rhett comes from Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, the same source of past Irish stars left tackle Ronnie Stanley and tight end Alizé Mack. The No. 49 player in the class, these rankings keep getting cited simply to give an idea of how much of the top-100 recruits Freeman and Notre Dame have already impressed in this cycle.

DEFENSIVE BACK Peyton Bowen — The No. 76 player in the class and No. 6 safety, Bowen (pictured at top) was the last piece of good news for the Irish on New Year’s Day, committing a few hours before the Fiesta Bowl faceplant.

Notre Dame Recruiting Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s... Notre Dame beats LSU for four-star linebacker Jaiden Ausberry out of Baton... A third four-star receiver commitment, Jaden Greathouse, elevates Notre Dame’s...

Five of these eight players fit into the top 100 in the country to date. Those same five are all within the top-10 recruits at their respective positions. All eight commits are in the top 20 at their positions.

The recruiting class of 2023 standing at No. 1 in the country the first week of February is largely a meaningless boast; those rankings will move with frequency over the next six months. But having eight consensus four-star prospects as the starting point in the class is the type of strength in recruiting that Notre Dame bet on when it promoted Freeman.

72 Caleb Johnson, sophomore offensive tackle, former Auburn pledgeNo.","Listed measurements: 5-foot-11 ⅜, 182 pounds.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A fifth-year veteran, Lenzy has two seasons of eligibility remaining. In other words, he could conceivably return to Notre Dame for the 2023 season, as unlikely as that seems.

Depth Chart: For the number of criticisms that can be levied at Lenzy — more on them below — he has managed to stay available more often than not throughout his career, and right now that is vital for the Irish. Lenzy will start at Ohio State in 29 days. In years past, he fit best as the field (wide) receiver, but with sophomore Lorenzo Styles also in the mix, Lenzy may move around the formation.

Recruiting: Lenzy’s recruitment remains a lesson for fans on what not to do. A consensus four-star prospect, Lenzy de-committed from Notre Dame to instead head to his homestate Oregon with an understanding he could also run track for the historic Ducks program. Irish fans were not fans of that choice, and some made that known to Lenzy via social media.

When Oregon head coach Willie Taggart left to take the job at Florida State, Lenzy flipped back to Notre Dame. Ducks fans were not pleased with that choice, and some made that clear to Lenzy online.

His commitment came complete with a letter to those fans, all those who had criticized his choices as he plotted out his life, and if anything, it did not speak harshly enough to those loudmouths.

CAREER TO DATE

As available as Lenzy has been, he has also missed a number of games to concussions, nagging hamstring issues and then pandemic protocols. Missing nine games in his first two active seasons was not a great sign, but by current Notre Dame worries, that would be near full health.

When he did play, Lenzy shined in 2019, taking a total of 24 touches for 454 yards and four touchdowns. Hamstring troubles kept him from building on that momentum in 2020, but he was largely consistent in 2021. Lenzy caught at least one pass in every game except against Navy and had at least 21 receiving yards in nine games.

In the Fiesta Bowl, Lenzy was one of four receivers the Irish could trot out as quarterback Jack Coan dropped back to pass 70 times. Lenzy openly admitted to being gassed in the fourth quarter of that effort, as he caught seven passes for 60 yards.

2019: 9 games, 2 starts; 11 catches for 254 yards and two touchdowns with 13 rushes for 200 yards and two more scores.

2020: 7 games, 1 start; 7 catches for 63 yards and one touchdown with 3 rushes for 8 yards.

2021: 13 games, 11 starts; 32 catches for 350 yards and three touchdowns with 5 rushes for 69 yards.

QUOTES

Lenzy’s health has been a mixed bag. He has never suffered a season-compromising injury like fifth-year receiver Joe Wilkins (Lisfranc) is worrying about right now or that cost sixth-year Avery Davis (ACL) the final month of 2021. But Lenzy has also never been the most durable. There was nothing Lenzy could do to avoid those early-career concussions, aside from not playing football at all, but plaguing hamstrings can be vaguely addressed in the offseason, as can an overall slight frame.

Lenzy has put on muscle, even if his current listed weight is up just one pound from this time a year ago.

Tommy Rees: “Can’t say enough good things about Braden Lenzy right now…His dependability right now is through the roof.” — Patrick Engel (@PatrickEngel_) April 9, 2022

Some of that improved strength was visible in Lenzy’s favorite route, a post corner that he could deploy more often in 2021. The route requires a cut back from momentum at about 135 degrees.

“It’s definitely tough,” Lenzy said to Jac Collinsworth on the ND on NBC Podcast in September. “I couldn’t really do it for a long time, or if I did it was inconsistent. It has become one of my better routes.

“I actually got one in the Wisconsin game. Avery caught one, too. I just think it’s so fun. … For me, it’s probably my most efficient, highest completion percentage catch.”

Jac also asked Lenzy what his favorite route is, a simple question we never ask these guys.

""Probably a post corner.""

Then @JacCollinsworth played it smooth, ""Explain what that is like I have no idea?""

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“It sounds simplistic, but it remains true: Lenzy’s success will come down to health. He has shown he can excel at the collegiate level. There are not enough quality cornerbacks on Notre Dame’s schedule to truly hamper him this season. Only his hamstrings can do that.

“The Irish do not need Lenzy to be a 50-catch receiver, or even a 40-catch receiver. His 2019 effectiveness would do plenty to worry opposing defenses on every snap.

“If Lenzy ends 2021 with literally two catches in every game, but one of them is always for at least 20 yards, it will mean Notre Dame’s offense found a gear it has lacked for a few years. That may sound meager, but it would be 25 catches for at least 300 yards and more likely closer to 450.

“Add in a few long touchdowns and Lenzy’s impact will gain more notoriety.

“Measuring expectations for Lenzy may not feel necessary given his talent is proven, but doing so may also measure his workload, which should then lead to more efficient usage. Lenzy’s snaps and targets should not be about quantity, but about quality. …

“From there, Lenzy can return in 2022 and add some more muscle to his frame to become a more consistent receiving option. He will never be a classic possession receiver, but that is also not his skill set, nor a common player in the NFL anymore.

“If Lenzy can prove healthy for an extended stretch, then the NFL will want to take a chance on him. Two years totaling 60-plus catches and 1,200 yards will get the NFL’s attention.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

If last summer’s projection was accurate and Lenzy will put up 60 catches and 1,200 yards across the 2021 and 2022 seasons, then he owes 28 catches and 850 yards this year. Averaging 30.4 yards per catch would be otherworldly, but the 850 receiving yards would also be rather noteworthy. In the last five seasons, only three Irish receivers have topped that mark: Miles Boykin (872 in 2018), Chase Claypool (1,037 in 2019) and Kevin Austin (888 in 2021).

Lenzy reaching that many yards would be even more shocking considering he will be no higher than the No. 2 receiving option for Notre Dame this season, thanks to preseason All-American and rather-certain first-round draft pick tight end Michael Mayer.

The 28 catches, however, may be more underselling Lenzy’s potential this year.

Lenzy has taken 1,011 snaps in his career, and on 71 of them, the ball ended up in his hands. The math there is rather simple: On about 7 percent of the plays, Lenzy gets the ball.

The Irish have something resembling no receiver depth. While that may lead offensive coordinator Tommy Rees to slow down the game — Lenzy could run 70 routes in the bowl game after a month off; he could not do it on a weekly basis — Notre Dame should not fall too far off last year’s 903 offensive snaps. Lenzy should play three-quarters of them, as one of two stalwarts in the receiving corps along with Styles.

By that math, Lenzy will see about 600 plays. 7 percent of 600 is 42.

If Lenzy ends 2022 with 42 touches, he could surpass 600 yards from scrimmage. If that includes a handful of touchdowns, it will be a solid contribution.

And all of that does not boost any of Lenzy’s trends for supposed gained strength or simple maturity. Add those in and Lenzy could get that much closer to 1,000 yards from scrimmage. The Irish would be overjoyed with such.

DOWN THE ROAD

Lenzy’s speed may make him a mid-round draft pick. His recruitment was long ago by now, but anyone who could sprint for Oregon has the type of speed that entices some NFL front offices to make rash decisions.

If he gets through the 2022 season without missing a game, his durability worries will be far enough in the rearview mirror as to not make those franchises hesitate.

The NFL is on the verge of a run on young receivers, value available in their services while the top-10 receivers in the league make money not too far from what quarterbacks are usually paid. That will further strengthen Lenzy’s chances of getting drafted.

With 2022 health, do not expect Lenzy back in 2023.

CAREER TO DATE

Lenzy’s career thus far is a story of unavailability. Between concussions, nagging hamstring issues and pandemic protocols, he has managed to play in only 16 of 25 games the last two seasons, not to mention missing all of 2018 for some hybrid of those slowings and a want to preserve a year of eligibility.

Nonetheless, Lenzy shined in 2019, taking a total of 24 touches for 454 yards and four touchdowns. When the ball was in his hands, be it off a handoff, a sweep masquerading as a pass or a genuine downfield throw, Lenzy made things happen.

Then his hamstrings refused to let him find a rhythm in 2020, cutting short his season for all intents and purposes in October, after limiting him throughout September.

2018: Did not play.

2019: 9 games; 11 catches for 254 yards and two touchdowns with 13 rushes for 200 yards and two more scores.

2020: 7 games; 7 catches for 63 yards and one touchdown with three rushes for 8 yards.

QUOTES

It has never been a question of talent with Lenzy. His hands have never been a weakness, and his speed is described as “track speed” only because it defies most football expressions.

But workload and fragility have cost him, so the Irish attempted to build more gradually this spring.

“Braden Lenzy, the last couple days, has really come on,” offensive coordinator Tommy Rees said in mid-April. “I’m excited about the trust that we’re building there in order for him to be an expanded role and hand him more on his plate.”

2021 OUTLOOK

It sounds simplistic, but it remains true: Lenzy’s success will come down to health. He has shown he can excel at the collegiate level. There are not enough quality cornerbacks on Notre Dame’s schedule to truly hamper him this season. Only his hamstrings can do that.

Notre Dame will kick off against Ohio State in 117 days and will return to the practice field 29 days before that. Do that quick math, and as of tomorrow, there are 87 days until the Irish return to football activities.

While we all enjoy summer vacations, holiday cookouts and music festivals, some football thoughts can and should still pass the time. They always have. They always will.

Thus, yes, tomorrow, yet another rendition of Notre Dame 99-to-0 will commence. This will be the fifth time in six years the series has passed the time, the exception obviously being the uncertain and silent summer of 2020. If counting this series’ predecessor, Irish A-to-Z, it extends back to 2014.

The purpose remains the same: Give an in-depth look at each player on Notre Dame’s roster heading into 2022. It allows some players to resurface in your consciousness after a few quiet seasons: Senior defensive tackle Jacob Lacey comes to mind; he may start this fall after amassing 30 tackles across the last three years, making 11 appearances in each season, largely as a reserve. Some unique but unheralded stories get told: The origin of Bo Bauer’s #BeADog mentality from last summer comes to mind; junior punter Bryan Dowd’s double-duty between soccer and football may warrant such notice this year.

Mostly, it fills these quiet months and serves as a literal countdown until the season is on the precipice. No, as of tomorrow, practices will not be 99 days away, and the count will remain inflated as such until a precipitous drop from No. 72 Caleb Johnson to No. 57 Jayson Ademilola within just five days, but the falling jersey numbers should serve as a figurative calendar countdown, nonetheless.

Tomorrow will begin with either junior defensive lineman Rylie Mills or fifth-year Arkansas State transfer kicker Blake Grupe. Both wear No. 99, though they could not look more different in doing so.

Rylie Mills (6-5 1/8, 283) is nearly a foot taller than Blake Grupe (5-7 3/8, 150) and weighs nearly twice as many pounds… But they both wear No. 99 for Notre Dame. College football rules. pic.twitter.com/KTawh0CVIN — Tyler Horka (@tbhorka) March 27, 2022

Which one kicks us off is a decision very sincerely not yet made. Perhaps Grupe should get the honor since it will be his only chance to, while Mills has done so each of the last two seasons and presumably will again in 2023. (Only now, in confirming he led off, remembering this series began in 2020 before an indefinite furlough cut it short in its first days. Alas.)

Fifth-year receiver Braden Lenzy will wrap up the series for only the second time. Keep in mind, the No. 0 was not allowed by the NCAA until the 2020 season. Before that, Lenzy wore No. 25. As of now, the content calendar expects Lenzy’s entry to come Aug. 4, the day before the Irish should return to the practice field, but the content calendar also has 86 entries and the NCAA allows only 85 scholarship players in the fall, so some of this is always in flux.

Not to mention, this scribe has a personal failing that he will not work ahead by 10 days before taking his nieces, nephews and parents camping, and sometimes the hotspot connection is not so strong from the shores of Lake Michigan. That could always lead to later compensation by publishing both sophomore safety Justin Walters and sophomore running back Logan Diggs on the same day, both wearing No. 22. Worse things could happen, but they will also hopefully be avoided.

Some numbers will be guessed and corrected later on, the first of which should be incoming freshman tight end Eli Raridon. He is currently slotted at No. 89, mostly because the digits are available and within the parameters expected of tight ends. Again, some flux remains despite this being an annual series.

From Blake Grupe to Braden Lenzy, the season will come again soon.

2022-23 year, eligibility: Sixth-year graduate transfer with one season of eligibility remaining after redshirting in 2017 and then being granted another year thanks to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver.

Depth Chart: Either Grupe or sophomore Josh Bryan will handle Notre Dame’s placekicking duties, but neither separated himself during spring practices. Grupe has an experience advantage, to say the least, so he should be presumed the starter.

Recruiting: All the Irish really needed to do was contact Grupe. Once he was in the transfer portal, that connection alone was enough to sway him.

“They didn’t have to take a whole lot of pushing,” he said upon arrival in January. “I was in the portal, Notre Dame reached out, and it was over. How do you not want to be a part of this? Be a part of a winning tradition, be a part of the school’s tradition, everything that makes Notre Dame football the way it is.

“There were other schools that reached out, but when Notre Dame reached out, it was kind of over with.”

Of the incoming transfers this spring, Grupe was one of the lesser heralded, as one might expect for a sixth-year kicker out of Arkansas State, but the Irish still treated Grupe like a star recruit on February’s version of National Signing Day, giving him the same video treatment they gave each and every signed recruit in December.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Grupe benefits from the Irish Players Club, as do the rest of his teammates, but wasting this section on that with each entry would be not only repetitive but also risk falling down a deep rabbit hole discussing what NFTs are and what they are not and wondering how sustainable the IPC will be. Instead, as it pertains to Grupe, let’s brainstorm ways his slight stature could be monetized.

It is too bad Smart Cars are no longer sold in the United States, per the Mercedes-Benz website, as Grupe could have been the only college football player able to fit in one and thus sincerely advocate for the brand.

CAREER TO DATE

Grupe’s success at Arkansas State was largely in terms of short-range accuracy. His longest field goal in his four seasons of kicking was from 50 yards, but he still went 64-for-86 over his career (74.4 percent). For context, Jonathan Doerer finished his collegiate career 49-of-64 (76.6 percent).

There were ups and downs for Grupe, which he attributed to preparation more than anything else. As a walk-on, his first season was spent learning. Then entering the 2020 season, the pandemic robbed Grupe of spring practice work.

“I’ve had up years and I’ve had years that I’m not as happy with,” he said in January. “My freshman year, as a walk-on, I had a lot of learning to do, and I did and I kind of bounced back. Going into the COVID year, it was a weird year. We really didn’t have spring ball. We missed out on a lot of the preparation that leads to having success. Those all played factors, but at the end of the day, I have to go out and get it done.”

2018: 14-of-21 field goals, 35-of-38 PATs.

2019: 19-of-22 field goals, 53-of-53 PATs.

2020: 11-of-18 field goals, 43-of-45 PATs.

2021: 20-of-25 field goals, 31-of-32 PATs. Hit a game-winning, 42-yard field goal with only 1:17 remaining to beat Louisiana-Monroe in November.

QUOTES

Though Grupe went only 1-of-2 in the Blue-Gold Game, making from 36 yards and missing from 41, the greatest criticism of him is the lack of a booming leg. If Notre Dame has to rely on him to make a field goal from longer than 50 yards, the likelihood of success feels slim. That is, unless you believe Irish special teams coordinator Brian Mason.

“I know there is a real flack on my guy Grupe because he is the size of our leprechaun,” Mason said this spring. “But he is kicking from 55 (yards) in pre-practice, and I trust him to be able to make it from 55. He made it easy earlier at the beginning of practice, so I think he has more than good enough of a leg.”

2022 OUTLOOK

The reality is, 55 yards would be more than enough. Doerer’s career-long was 52 yards, and he made only four field goals of 50 yards or more throughout his three years as Notre Dame’s field-goal kicker. If the Irish need that long of a field goal this season, it will most likely be only once.

Otherwise, dialed-in Grupe’s accuracy should allow Bryan a year of focusing on kickoff duties. If Grupe circa 2020 shows up, then Mason will have Bryan to turn to.

It will be that simple. Grupe’s accuracy will either keep him in the job for 13 games or it will not. That may sound obvious, but Doerer could have gone into a poor spell and retained the job given his track record in South Bend. Grupe does not have that earned cushion.

DOWN THE ROAD

The NFL will require a bigger leg than Grupe has, so 2022 should be it in every football regard for the Missouri native.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A junior, Mills has three years of eligibility remaining thanks to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver.

Depth Chart: Mills may have established himself as the starting “Big” end for Notre Dame’s defensive line. If not, he will supplement fifth-year Justin Ademilola there while also leading the way at tackle. Mills’ versatility will allow defensive coordinator Al Golden’s front to have some multiplicity within its primary package.

Recruiting: A consensus four-star recruit and the No. 155 overall prospect in the class, per rivals.com, Mills could have gone to Alabama, Clemson or Georgia, not to mention Michigan, Florida or Oklahoma. Coming from the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Ill., the greatest threats to his Irish commitment may have been from Midwest powers Ohio State and Wisconsin, but his early enrollment plans always made it clear that Mills would not waver from his Notre Dame pledge.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Mills is best known, at least to this point, for his two-sack performance in a spot start at Virginia last November. In the moment, it seemed Mills got three sacks, but the third was officially credited to linebacker Bo Bauer. When Mills learned he would be starting in place of Myron Tagovailoa-Amosa (flu), he bet then-defensive line coach Mike Elston he would notch three sacks. Elston said if Mills did so, he could have the coach’s first-class seat on the flight back to South Bend.

Elson upheld his end of that bargain. In retrospect, Mills may have missed a chance at a quick sponsorship opportunity with whatever make of charter plane the Irish fly.

CAREER TO DATE

Mills had the size to play right away for Notre Dame in 2020, though he did not amass gross stats. As a sophomore, it was that flash at Virginia that revealed just how good Mills may become. Up until then, he had been a reliable piece of interior depth, but against the overmatched Cavaliers, he revealed he could excel on the edge, just as Tagovailoa-Amosa did in his position move last season.

2020: 9 games, 7 tackles with two for loss including half a sack.

2021: 13 games, 16 tackles with three sacks.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

QUOTES

As spring practices went along, Mills worked on the edge more and more. Clearly, he was impressing there.

“Rylie is another one who is having one of the better springs out of the entire group,” new defensive line coach Al Washington said. “To single him out for a simple fact, he’s really taken the next step.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“The idea of Mills cross-training brings up Tagovailoa-Amosa again. Though he has a few inches on the veteran, Mills’ game is similar to Tagovailoa-Amosa’s, who has always played longer than his 6-foot-2 ½ frame. Both showed an ability to penetrate into the backfield early in their career, a byproduct both of their length and of their quickness.

“Defensive linemen with notable length and quickness find their way to the end, as often as not. If nothing else, giving Mills some work at ‘Big’ end will provide Notre Dame more flexibility along its best position group.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Not to sound hyperbolic, but Mills may be the piece that can elevate the Irish defense from very good to great. Usually, the possibility of that level-up gets attributed to playmaking linebackers like Jordan Botelho or Marist Liufau, and understandably so. If they reach their maximum potential, Notre Dame’s defense will enjoy some speed it has long needed, Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah’s 2020 aside.

But a defensive end serving as the bookend to senior Isaiah Foskey would give the Irish the type of pass rush that makes a Playoff contender. Why were the types of people that were so confident in Clemson in 2018 just as confident in Georgia in 2021? Their defensive fronts were NFL-ready.

Mills is not NFL-ready, but if he approached those heights, suddenly the Irish would have a force on their hands. Quarterbacks would have nowhere to go to escape Foskey, who is already NFL-ready.

But that is the ideal. The more realistic level for Mills in 2022 is as a multi-positional luxury that allows Golden to put opposing offensive lines in constantly compromised positions. On obvious passing downs, Mills can move inside to three-technique, with Ademilola at Big end. That will give Notre Dame three defensive linemen with their ears pinned back, and with just that front, it should be able to create pressure on the passer.

If three rushers are enough to hassle a passer, it no longer much matters if they get to him. Eight defenders covering at most five targets is an obvious math problem for that quarterback.

This will be the barometer for Mills’ success. How often do the Irish need a fourth or fifth pass rusher on third downs? If rarely, that is a credit to his ability to disrupt from the middle, an ability that could help cover for Notre Dame’s worries in the defensive backfield.

DOWN THE ROAD

Mills might have the size right now to consider the NFL after 2021, but such a jump from a defensive lineman is usually seen from a year away. He has not yet shown the dominance necessary to look at that possibility with sincerity, not that he has had much of a chance to date, with only 411 career snaps. He may be one of the five players seeking an evaluation after the season, but that should be to confirm what is expected, that he will return in 2023.

At that point, Mills should be Notre Dame’s primary pass rusher, with Foskey a rookie in the NFL. That will be Mills’ star turn.

He may be as low as fourth on that depth chart, behind fifth-year Jayson Ademilola, senior Howard Cross and sophomore Jason Onye, but Onye did not appear in any games in 2021. Ford could conceivably move past him and into the rotation.

Recruiting: After December’s signing period, Ford still kept moving up the recruiting rankings. Rivals.com considered him the No. 105 overall prospect then, but after his All-American Bowl showing, he landed at No. 51 in the final rankings. The No. 6 defensive end in the class, per rivals.com, Ford nearly committed to Oklahoma.

Then Marcus Freeman arrived as Notre Dame’s defensive coordinator. For all of Freeman’s recruiting successes in the 16 months since he was first hired onto Brian Kelly’s staff, Ford was his first win. Ford made it clear that Freeman was what swayed him from the Sooners.

“I really think the Marcus Freeman situation changed things a bit,” Ford said to The South Bend Tribune.

Again, Ford was referring to defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman, not Irish head coach Marcus Freeman.

Ford also considered Georgia and his homestate Florida as finalists before making that January 2021 decision.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

The most obvious application of true name, image and likeness rights was always via a car dealership. Local dealerships have long formed relationships with outgoing players as they prepped for the draft, usually getting them a cheap (or perhaps free) lease within a week of their last game. If nothing else, it was a chance to form a relationship before that player would want to buy his first nice car.

Such a relationship is now allowed with any player. If Gurley Leep Ford, south of Notre Dame, just a bit short of the St. Joseph County Fairgrounds, has not already called Tyson Ford, then Buddy Garrity is assuredly rolling over in his fictional grave. (The Friday Night Lights character would be about 67 now. No offense to actor Brad Leland, but Garrity would be dead from a cardiac-related event by now, right?)

QUOTES

When Freeman first became Notre Dame’s head coach, it was expected his staff would remain largely intact. That was not merely an external thought. Actions reflected the internal thinking, as well, such as putting those assistant coaches in front of the media repeatedly throughout December and even January.

If Freeman had known defensive line coach Mike Elston would jump to his alma mater, Michigan, then he may not have had the recruiting coordinator speak during December’s signing period. But Elston’s praisings then hold validity yet, as they were sincere in the moment, and his work with Freeman is what brought the Irish this defensive lineman out of Missouri.

“Tyson is just a big, athletic, physical player,” Elston said. “He’s going to take some development. He’s not at a big school where there’s a bunch of coaches there that are helping him daily with the little things that make a great defensive lineman.

“It’s great he’s coming in mid-year because he’s going to learn a lot of that, he’s going to get a lot of development very early. It’ll be exciting to see him go down to the All-American Game and stack up with those guys.

“Know what I love about Tyson? And I didn’t know this prior to him coming on an official visit, was he’s really a sponge in football. He wants to know football. He wants to sit there, sit next to you, watch film. What should I be doing here? What should I be looking at? What should I be thinking about?

“That’s going to be huge. Sometimes when a young man is that talented, it comes easy to him and he doesn’t learn how to study the game, and the fact that he loves the game and wants to study it, that’s going to be big.”

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN FORD SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“Ford already brings plenty of strength to the edge, keeping offensive linemen from getting into his body, but there is some fundamental work ahead of him in developing his pass rush tendencies.”

2022 OUTLOOK

The move to tackle from end may come as a surprise. Ford was a highly-sought defensive end. He excelled at the position in high school. Why move him so quickly?

It likely reflects what the Irish strength and conditioning staff expects from Ford’s physical development. If it thought he is more likely to remain long and lean, then he may have remained at end, but if it thinks his body will be best served by adding 10-20 more pounds, then he could suddenly be an ideal tackle.

Nailing that kind of projection is harder than we think from the outside, but it is also crucial to a player’s development.

In the short term, it likely means Ford becomes more of a developmental piece. He may be able to hold his own on the inside against the lightweights on Notre Dame’s schedule — and let’s establish those now as Marshall, Cal and UNLV — but with two of those within the first three weeks of his freshman season, he may not be tasked with even that work. It will be more important for Ford to add muscle and learn the intricacies of his new position than it will be for him to measure himself against Cal’s lackluster defensive line.

DOWN THE ROAD

Ademilola considered the NFL following the 2021 season. With a shoulder injury, his return was always exceedingly likely, but not a certainty. It should be following 2022. That will leave Cross and either Onye or Ford to lead the way on the inside as a penetrating tackle.

They have similar profiles, as both Onye and Ford were recruited as “Big” ends from areas with middling preps competition, and both moved inside to tackle quickly. With an extra year of collegiate nutrition, Onye is already up to a listed weight of 289 pounds, so he has a clear advantage there.

But Ford has the better profile otherwise. A four-star recruit, rather than three-, from Missouri instead of Rhode Island, he projects to a better collegiate career, plain and simple. Of course, these things can be fickle on a case-by-case basis, but Ford should be given the benefit of the doubt.

If he cracks the two-deep in 2023, he will be counted on to provide a pass rush from the inside. That should be within Ford’s skill set. From there, he could start in 2024 and 2025. At the very least, none of that would be a surprise.

His father now a fireman, there may be some charitable endeavor that would tie Rubio to a firehouse. It would certainly be fitting. The newest Notre Dame NIL collective — Friends of the University of Notre Dame — claims its focus will be charity work, paying the players to then advocate for a cause of their choosing, so this may be more viable than simply some misguided musings on the endless internet.

Rubio also has his own line of apparel available for purchase.

CAREER TO DATE

Rubio played in only the Fiesta Bowl as a freshman, making one assisted tackle. Ahead of him, the Irish still had five defensive tackles in rotation, between Kurt Hinish, Jayson Ademilola, Howard Cross, Rylie Mills and Jacob Lacey.

A hyperextended elbow that plagued him in the spring of 2021 did not aid the early enrollee’s chances of early playing time.

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN FORD SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“Assuming the hyper-extended elbow that bothered Rubio at the end of spring practices does not linger into the summer and the preseason (and a knee trouble from his senior season does not reoccur), he should be ideally suited to pick up the work done by Mills last season. The then-freshman played 141 snaps throughout the unorthodox season, giving depth to the defensive interior.

“That need grows as the season progresses, hence Mills playing in only one of Notre Dame’s first four games. The advantage Rubio has compared to Mills is a real spring followed by a genuine strength and conditioning program this summer.

“If he takes to that program and his 289 pounds finds a bit more force, then Rubio can continue the Irish luxury of potent depth up front.”

2022 OUTLOOK

This is not intended to come across as bluntly as it will: If Rubio had been wowing the coaching staff in the spring, the addition of Smith would not have been as heralded as it was in early April. Some of that was mere depth concerns. No team can have enough quality defensive linemen. But some of it was a need to shore up nose tackle.

Rubio will play this season. There is no year to preserve eligibility. And he will presumably play well, possessing just about every physical attribute wanted for the position. To further support that with logic, if he was truly condemned to another year on the sidelines, Rubio likely would have worked at three-technique more this summer, where the Irish are better set with Ademilola and Cross, rather than filling in behind Lacey. The coaching staff expected Rubio to be within the two-deep.

That thin line between reserve and rotation player could be Rubio’s home for 2022, the fifth defensive tackle with all five playing. If Lacey was the fifth such tackle last season, he still appeared in 11 games and made 12 tackles with two for loss. He was a veritable piece of that defense.

Such a standard for Rubio in his sophomore year may seem small given his high recruiting ranks, but that is not always the best barometer. Defensive line has been Notre Dame’s best and deepest position group for the last four seasons. Underclassmen should be expected to need time to work their way into that rotation.

DOWN THE ROAD

At the least, the Irish will lose Ademilola and Smith after this season. That should leave Cross and Lacey as the 2023 starters, with Rubio their most experienced backup. Suddenly, the afterthought of the rotation could be a key piece to it.

And then, Rubio should start in 2024. Notre Dame continues to pull in quality defensive linemen — early-enrolled freshman Tyson Ford and incoming freshman Donovan Hinish will both demand playing time before too long — but Rubio’s size alone will establish him in the middle. He needed to add strength to that size when he arrived, and one year may not be enough time to add as much strength as needed, but two years will be.

Consider Rubio in 2023 a ripe candidate for what may come for senior end NaNa Osafo-Mensah this season. Once a high-profile recruit, an injury and a tough case of COVID cost Osafo-Mensah early chances. He fell from the outside’s view. Now, he is in the two-deep at “Big” end, a position that rotates frequently. He could explode back into the public’s consciousness this season and be deemed a revelation; really, he would simply be making the most of his first opportunity.

Rubio has not lost time to injury, but the Irish excess of talent in the middle has robbed him of those early opportunities all the same. To be clear, that is a good thing for Notre Dame, even if it means Rubio slowly falls from public anticipation. When he rectifies that, it will be less a dramatic moment and more an inevitable one.

CAREER TO DATE

Keanaaina has managed one tackle, in the Fiesta Bowl against Oklahoma State, in four career games.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“The pandemic cost every player differently — just like for the rest of us in everyday life — but it arguably cost many freshmen the most. While tight end Michael Mayer and running back Chris Tyree were able to contribute immediately, that was neither expected of Keanaaina nor viable. As written a year ago, he needed time in a collegiate strength and conditioning program. He still does.

“That work began this winter. It will continue this summer. But if all of 2021 is devoted to building Keanaaina’s lower-body strength, that can still be considered a productive season.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Keanaaina essentially lost his 2022 with that ACL torn in the first spring practice. The fastest of recoveries from an ACL injury is about nine months. In that ideal scenario, perhaps Keanaaina could be readying for a bowl game, but that rush would also stress his physical conditioning coming back from that injury.

It is more likely his timing sets Keanaaina up to return for next spring practices.

DOWN THE ROAD

Harvard graduate transfer Chris Smith will be on Notre Dame’s campus for only the 2022 season, meaning a healthy Keanaaina should have every chance to slot back in as Lacey’s understudy in 2023. A senior as a backup may not seem glorious, but such is the luxury of defensive line becoming the best Irish position group in recent years.

Lacey will be out of eligibility after 2023, at which point Keanaaina will have two years of eligibility remaining. He will have competition — again, namely Rubio and Hinish — but that should yield only depth. Depth has been the exact delight that has kept players like Keanaaina buried a bit on the depth chart. In that respect, it can cut both ways.

Early in their careers, depth limits their opportunities. Later in their careers, it somewhat assures them.

Depth Chart: Neither Bryan nor Arkansas State transfer Blake Grupe was particularly impressive this spring, leaving some doubt as to who will lead the way in placekicking duties, but Grupe likely has the slight edge thanks to experience. Regardless, Bryan should handle kickoff duties for Notre Dame.

Recruiting: Bryan’s recruitment was a case study in pandemic recruiting. He was committed to Colorado for the longest time, not only wanting to go to Notre Dame, but also knowing the Irish wanted him. They just did not know if they would have space for him. It was not until the NCAA created some flexibility amid scholarship limits — specifically, that fifth-year kicker Jonathan Doerer would not count toward the maximum of 85 scholarships in 2021 if he used the year of eligibility added by the pandemic — that then-special teams coordinator Brian Polian could tell Bryan there was space for him at Notre Dame.

Bryan subsequently wasted no time in flipping his commitment.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Current events shed more doubt on the viability of an NIL collective based around NFTs, an endeavor that fills nearly all of Bryan’s recent social media activity. But in his Twitter bio, he still touts Chris Sailer Kicking, the position-specific coach and summer camp that Bryan credits for some of his success, as do many collegiate kickers.

If Bryan still sees fit to push that version of his player profile, it continues to reason there is some version of a partnership in which he can more aggressively advertise for Chris Sailer Kicking.

CAREER TO DATE

Bryan kicked the final PAT of the home season in 2022, following Myron Tagovailoa-Amosa’s memorable fumble return for a touchdown. Notre Dame pulled Doerer after it amassed a 38-0 first-half lead. Harrison Leonard kicked the next PAT, and then Bryan got his brief turn, though Doerer hit a 26-yard field goal between those point afters.

That was Bryan’s only appearance in 2021.

QUOTES

Notre Dame chasing Grupe could be taken as a criticism of Bryan’s readiness, but new Irish special teams coordinator Brian Mason had something broader in mind as he filled out his specialists depth chart after arriving this winter. When he joined Marcus Freeman’s staff, Mason had only four specialists rostered, including two long snappers. He wanted more than double that.

“We needed some more experience,” Mason said in February. “We needed some more competition to be able to offset at certain positions where we were a little bit inexperienced, having to replace a starting kicker and a starting punter. How can we be able to add some experience and some leadership in addition to some competition in different areas where we’re still talented, but maybe young?”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Polian said it in no uncertain terms. He does not want to rely on a freshman kicker, and will not rely on a freshman kicker. The last time the Irish deployed a freshman kicker in any respect was Doerer’s freshman season, in 2017. His tendency to botch kickoffs nearly severed the Polian-Brian Kelly working relationship before it had a chance to genuinely begin.

“Bryan probably does not have that same tick in his form, but he may have some tick in his form. Taking the 2021 season to suss it out will be an exercise in caution and proactive coaching.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Bryan went 0-of-2 in the Blue-Gold Game, missing from both 48 and 37 yards, while Grupe went 1-of-2, neither of their final impressions before the summer layoff anything but lackluster. When Grupe is dialed in, he has proven to be accurate, and that should give him the first crack at the placekicking duties when leg swings actually matter. But if he falters, Mason will turn to Bryan. That was part of bringing in Grupe, after all; competition can cut both ways.

More likely, Bryan will be called upon for one or two particularly long field goal attempts this season, having a stronger leg than Grupe. That is also why he should handle kickoffs.

A year ago, Brain Polian was more than reluctant to play a freshman at kicker. Not all that much has changed for Bryan, but it can only change by getting on the field. Those long field goals and kickoffs are the first gradual step toward that change.

DOWN THE ROAD

Grupe cannot play past this season. Walk-on Harrison Leonard entered the transfer portal, quite probably in part because of Grupe’s arrival. That will leave Bryan in 2023.

Mason may once again go portal hunting to beef up his depth chart — that said, wanting 8-10 kickers, punters and long snappers does seem like overkill — but it would take routinely frustrating practices from Bryan for Mason to actively look to keep him at No. 2 after this season.

All that said, if Marcus Freeman intends to follow up the hype around his promotion with on-field success, kicking woes will not be tolerated. Obviously, Bryan cannot dissuade those worries until he has done so on Saturdays, but he will need to all the same, be it in 2022 or 2023.

2022-23 year, eligibility: An early-enrolled freshman, Gobaira has all four years of eligibility remaining, and it is quite likely the same will be said a year from now.

Depth Chart: Gobaira is, at best, fourth among Notre Dame’s Vyper ends.

Recruiting: Gobaira chose the Irish over offers from Arizona State, Virginia Tech and Nebraska, to name a few. The Sun Devils were the most aggressive in chasing the consensus-four star and No. 6 overall end in the class, per rivals.com. Instead, the No. 84 prospect in the class of 2022 committed to Notre Dame more than 10 months before he could sign on the dotted line.

Those recruiting rankings suggest someone who should have been chased by more blue-blood programs. Blame the pandemic for keeping Gobaira out of sight, with so many camps canceled before his junior year, as he started to put on weight. Then, his junior season was delayed until February, by which point he was committed to the Irish. When he broke through on the field, his recruitment was already over, for all intents and purposes.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

A defensive end buried on the depth chart when he should still be in high school may not be the most likely candidate for an endorsement deal already, but in scrolling through Gobaira’s social media profiles briefly, a thought occurs: How long until the All-American Bowl pays high schoolers for appearing in the showcase?

2022 Notre Dame DE commit Aiden Gobaira (@aiden__gobaira) gets a sack in the All-American Bowl. pic.twitter.com/VaSZxi62Wi — Matt Freeman (@mattfreemanISD) January 8, 2022

If nothing else, Gobaira’s time in San Antonio confirmed to him he belonged among the best pass rushers in the class of 2022. There is some value in that confidence.

“My week in San Antonio was a blast,” he said in February. “It really was a place where I could see how my skills shaped up against elite guys like that. I don’t want to say I was the best pass rusher or one of the best pass rushers there, because there were some crazy guys.”

QUOTES

If the pandemic wreaked such havoc on Gobaira’s recruitment, how did the Irish track him down? He did not partake in the usual summer camp circuit in 2020, for obvious reasons, and when he committed to Notre Dame, he had not yet logged any new highlights.

“We got on him early,” former Irish defensive line coach Mike Elston said when Gobaira signed his National Letter of Intent in December. “We watched him do some drill work when coach (Marcus) Freeman first got on campus, and we were deciding who we wanted to target. … We watched at a combine Aiden had gone to, we watched his film and some workouts, and we knew exactly what we would be getting — a big, tall, athletic, high-motor player that has great athleticism that is going to be an elite pass rusher.”

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN GOBAIRA SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“When first hired as Notre Dame’s defensive coordinator, Marcus Freeman’s first two commitments came from defensive ends listed at 6-foot-6. He clearly will focus on length on the edge. …

“Gobaira desperately needs to add weight, but not at the expense of quickness. His lacrosse background should emphasize how athletic he is and why Freeman sought him. …

“Irish defensive line coach Mike Elston has made depth a priority along his front, and Notre Dame did not exactly excel in finding ends in the previous class, ending up with two in Will Schweitzer and Jason Onye. That could yield playing time for Gobaira sooner than otherwise expected. …

“That relative miss in 2021 at defensive end should be to Gobaira’s benefit. After Isaiah Foskey and Justin Ademilola work their way through the program no later than the end of the 2022 season, the Irish will have only NaNa Osafo-Mensah as a proven commodity on the edge, and he will be down to two years of eligibility at that point.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Notre Dame is set at Vyper end this season. Senior Isaiah Foskey will lead the way, and while he will not play every snap, taking a potential All-American off the field is not something to do too often. Behind him, fifth-year end Justin Ademilola will split his time between both end spots. They should handle the bulk of the work at Vyper.

Behind them, senior Osita Ekwonu can fill in. Could Gobaira get some mop-up work in an October blowout of UNLV? Absolutely, but that should not be his only work in 2022.

Go back up to the top of this article and check Gobaira’s listed measurements. He is currently the definition of long. In winter workouts, he was trying to keep up with Foskey in sprints. In other words, Gobaira has the speed and range to excel on kickoff and punt coverage units.

That should not lead to more than four appearances, simply because preserving that year of eligibility makes too much sense not to do, but Gobaira could exit the season with a handful of tackles and some distinct memories of Notre Dame Stadium on Saturdays.

If having to guess those four games, UNLV and Navy would be the first nominees.

DOWN THE ROAD

All of a sudden, Notre Dame will need help at end in 2023. Foskey and Ademilola should both be in the NFL at that point, leaving a gap in experience for Notre Dame to turn to. Current junior Rylie Mills and senior NaNa Osafo-Mensah will both have some reps under the belts, but both at “Big” end, not at Vyper.

That will leave names like Ekwonu and Gobaira. If picking between those two, Gobaira could very well be more likely, a youngster’s potential allowing a higher ceiling than an upperclassman who has yet to breakthrough. But someone could also move over to Vyper, such as Osafo-Mensah or early-enrolled freshman Tyson Ford, despite his quick move to tackle this spring.

Suffice it to say, the Irish will need new names at Vyper end in 2023, and Gobaira will be among them as a sophomore.

CAREER TO DATE

After making two tackles in his one appearance as a freshman, both for losses, Ehrensberger made three tackles in 10 games in 2021.

2020: 1 game, two tackles, both for loss, one of which was a sack.

2021: 10 games, three tackles, one sack.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“To be blunt and to the point, Ehrensberger may not see more than a few handfuls of snaps in 2021. Not only does he still need to put on strength and weight, as Kelly discussed, but (Myron) Tagovailoa-Amosa moved to end with making an impact in mind. Ademilola has proven he can make an impact since the 2018 Playoff. Osafo-Mensah is coming up on a make-or-break season of sorts.

“Deferring to those interests at the expense of Ehrensberger will not be the coaching staff’s explicit intent, but doing so will also allow Ehrensberger time to find that strength and weight. Quite literally, the one thing this prospect needs most is time. …

“Emphasizing Ehrensberger’s timeline serves the future depth chart well. Upperclassmen’s practical eligibility is impossible to nail down currently due to that universal waiver in 2020, but just like that waiver did not impact Ehrensberger’s clock in 2020, it will not impact his playing time in years to come.

“He should see a contributing reserve role in 2022, but his real time to shine will come in 2023 and 2024, and none of the names mentioned ahead of him on the depth chart will still be factors come then.

“When Notre Dame signed Ehrensberger — with little football experience and even less exposure to pertinent talent — Kelly foreshadowed Elston’s comments about recruiting years later. This past February, Elston called the Irish a ‘developmental’ program, and it was intended as a strength. Along Elston’s defensive line, in particular, it has been.

“‘You’ve seen the development of our defensive line, where it came in and where it is,’ Kelly said back in December of 2019 when Ehrensberger signed his National Letter of Intent. “We want to continue to look toward that model where those guys can be looked at as elite players as they develop.

“‘We can see him as an elite player as he develops in the program. So for us to invest all of that time, we have to be able to see him develop in our program as an elite player down the road.’”

point, this German project will have his chance to prove prescient Elston’s and Notre Dame’s long-ago faith.

2022 OUTLOOK

There is every reason to believe in Osafo-Mensah. This space will continue to espouse that this summer; he only fell off the general radar thanks to the pandemic and then an injury, not to mention depth along the defensive line. When Tagovailoa-Amosa made the move to “Big” end last season, it benefited both him and the Irish. The biggest loser was Osafo-Mensah, back down to third on the depth chart through no fault of his own.

But, Osafo-Mensah has not proven his abilities on Saturdays. Until he does, nothing should be taken for certain. Such is the nature of projecting the futures of 18- to 23-year-olds.

If Osafo-Mensah stumbles, Ehrensberger may get a chance for an early arrival. His development was long expected to take at least three years. This is the third. As a recruit, he was relatively new to the sport of football. His length drew Elston’s and Notre Dame’s eyes. The rest would take time.

Is now the time? Frankly, unlikely. Projects usually wait until their senior years to pay off, and Ehrensberger was always known as a project. But, his length may expedite Ehrensberger’s arrival. While he is listed at 255 pounds and that may seem light, the Irish strength and conditioning staff has not made it a priority to add more. Ehrensberger was listed at 247 pounds as a freshman and 252 as a sophomore. This is his body.

Given that reality, his size still exists. He is wide, he is very wide. Ehrensberger can set the edge and allow the linebackers behind him to track down the running back. That may get him some playing time, regardless of how Osafo-Mensah performs.

DOWN THE ROAD

The bad news for Ehrensberger is good news for the Irish. Thanks to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver, all three of he, Mills and Osafo-Mensah have three seasons of eligibility remaining.

On the other side of the defensive line, though, neither senior Isaiah Foskey nor fifth-year Justin Ademilola — who will work at “Big” end some, as well — should be back in 2023. Look for one of the Big ends, perhaps most likely Osafo-Mensah, to try his hand at Vyper next spring.

That will move Ehrensberger firmly into the two-deep. While the position coach has changed, it should still be assumed that anyone within the two-deep will see plenty of playing time. At that point, this German project will have his chance to prove prescient Elston’s and Notre Dame’s long-ago faith.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Evans has three seasons of eligibility remaining after appearing in every game of Notre Dame’s 2021.

Depth Chart: A combination of injuries to others and his own successful debut season leave Evans as the rather clear No. 2 in the Irish depth chart, of course behind star junior Michael Mayer. The next three names on the depth chart all suffered leg injuries in 2021, and though they should be healthy this fall, they naturally lag behind as a result.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

One of the absolute most moronic aspects of NIL restrictions in the past was that players could not profit off camps geared toward kids. If Evans put his name on a camp to welcome the youth from his hometown in Ohio as they learned about football, that would have been a violation. Deeming that win-win illicit was the epitome of the NCAA’s idiocy.

Fortunately, that is no longer the case.

CAREER TO DATE

Evans played in every game as a freshman, though not usually as a downfield option. Nonetheless, he made two catches for 21 yards, both in blowouts.

QUOTES

Michael Mayer praising Evans’ broadly, and then pointing out he needs to continue his springtime work of improving his blocking, could give you, the reader, an idea of Evans’ current standing in the program, but frankly, Mayer’s words were not far from boilerplate. New Irish tight ends coach Gerad Parker saying similar things with a focus on defensive line scheme recognition may give an insight into how detail-focused Parker is, but it would not do too much in projecting Evans’ long-term potential.

RELATED READING: ‘Natural’ route-runner Mitchell Evans now must thrive inside

Rather, the best quote regarding Evans and what could be comes from an exchange in the Scott Stadium press box as Notre Dame blew out Virginia in November, an anecdote that leads that article from Tim O’Malley of Irish Illustrated, an anecdote relayed now with 98 percent certainty of who the two reporters in question were, two of the smarter minds around the Irish beat.

As Evans caught an eight-yard pass late in that route …

Reporter No. 1: “Why is Mayer still in the game?”

Reporter No. 2: “That’s Evans.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Taking this first year to learn the finer points of being a tight end, from route-running to not fighting the pass to run-blocking, will be time well spent for Evans, despite that impressive performance in the spring finale.

“Mayer affords Notre Dame that luxury, perhaps more than ever, which is saying something at ‘Tight End U.’ …

“Mayer will head to the NFL after the 2022 season, and Takacs will no longer be around by then, either. But Rees will still prefer to frequently utilize tight ends — a carryover from his most successful playing days — and the Irish will still have a bounty of them on the roster.

“Evans will get his chance then, but he will have to earn anything more than that. Between Bauman, Berrong and the pair of tight end commitments from last week, Notre Dame will have a plethora of highly-touted options. Evans may be the least among them, as far as recruiting rankings go.

“That is understandable, given he was a quarterback in high school. So by no means do those recruiting rankings condemn Evans to not moving up future depth charts. But he has some work to do to make that happen.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Rees will forever enjoy multiple-tight end sets, particularly when the Irish are as thin at receiver as they currently are. Evans will not match Mayer — no tight end outside of Georgia will — but serving as a complementary piece will help aid Notre Dame’s offense in needed ways.

Some of that will be run blocking, and to some extent, the return of offensive line coach Harry Hiestand should help Evans there. Hiestand will not spend extensive time with the tight ends, but any pointers he offers will aid them. As the Irish likely lean on the run game in 2022, those incremental improvements could prove pivotal.

That may be Evans’ most valuable contribution in 2022. If he can be as capable a run-blocker as he is a pass-catcher, even if both are only a bit above average rather than excellent, then Rees can stay in two-tight end packages without giving away anything to the opposing defense about his intentions. In that respect, even an 8-catch, 122-yard, 1-touchdown season from Evans would bode well.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

DOWN THE ROAD

Junior Kevin Bauman will be healthy in 2022, and Evans’ classmate Cane Berrong should recover from his torn ACL in short order, as well. Their absences in 2021 and Berrong’s limitations this spring gave Evans an advantage in the short term, but a year from now, those will be distant memories.

Furthermore, incoming freshmen Eli Raridon and Holden Staes will both factor into Rees’ plans sooner than later.

Suffice it to say, Evans will have his work cut out for him if he wants to become the next face of Tight End U. It is more likely he is a career No. 2, though at Notre Dame, that sometimes leads to an NFL draft pick. (See: fourth-rounder Durham Smythe in 2018 and seventh-rounder Ben Koyack in 2015)

If that does come to be the reality, Evans could continue to improve the next two seasons, eventually get passed by Berrong or Raridon in the depth chart and then transfer with a season of eligibility remaining, not to mention a Notre Dame degree. That path would be similar to George Takacs’, though a few years ahead of that pace.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A junior, Mayer technically has three seasons of eligibility remaining thanks to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver in 2020, but he will undoubtedly leave two of those years unused when he enters the NFL draft after this season.

Depth Chart: Mayer is not only Notre Dame’s top tight end; he may be the best Irish player overall.

Curiously enough, the two tight ends ranked ahead of him, Arik Gilbert and Darnell Washington, now play on the same team and neither is the best tight end there. Gilbert originally committed and went to LSU, where he was named Freshman All-SEC in 2020 with 35 catches for 368 yards and two touchdowns. He then transferred to Georgia, joining Washington, but he missed the national championship season due to personal reasons. Washington, meanwhile made nine catches for 145 yards and one touchdown in seven games, missing some time due to a foot injury.

Ahead of both, and perhaps ahead of Mayer in the national landscape as it pertains to All-American teams, is sophomore Brock Bowers. To tie this back to the original point, the recruiting rankings were too low on Bowers, as well, slotting him as the No. 8 tight end in the class of 2021.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

It will never not boggle the mind that the NCAA once restricted athletes from holding camps under their own names to connect with youth in their hometowns. Worse yet, there are still supposed fans of college football who think nothing good comes from athletes now having NIL rights.

Mayer and his brother A.J., former Miami (OH) quarterback now transferring to Arkansas State, did just that last month, and is this not the entire point of sports?

Grateful for the opportunity to go back to where it all started and teach with @ajm36640. See everybody next year! pic.twitter.com/QGcn12FdKS — Michael Mayer (@MMayer1001) May 3, 2022

CAREER TO DATE

Mayer was not Notre Dame’s starter from the outset of his career. Tommy Tremble held onto that role in 2020, but that was more nominal than anything else. Tight ends starting a game can be determined by the first play call as much as anything else. Mayer made his mark clear from his arrival on campus, right away looking like a Power Five starter.

2020: 12 games, 42 catches for 450 yards and two touchdowns.

2021: 12 games, 71 catches for 840 yards and seven touchdowns.

That seven touchdowns mark set a record at “Tight End U,” one that had stood for far too long, tracing back to Ken MacAfee in 1977. More pertinently, Mayer has led or nearly led the Irish in every receiving category in both years.

2020: Tied for the lead in catches (with Javon McKinley), second in yards (McKinley) and third in touchdowns (Bennett Skowronek and McKinley).

2021: Led in catches, second in yards (Kevin Austin ) and tied for the lead in touchdowns (Austin).

QUOTES

One quote speaks to Mayer’s future more than any other, and it comes from one of the few defenders who could match up with Mayer in 2021, someone who happened to do so in practices for most of two years.

if i learned 1 thing during the draft process, it’s that NFL teams love them some @MMayer1001 😂 https://t.co/qw4ynbJE8O — Kyle Hamilton (@kyledhamilton_) May 11, 2022

Don’t expect to hear Mayer discuss that reality much, though. He is too smart and too polished for that, as he has been since he was a freshman.

Irish offensive coordinator Tommy Rees and new tight ends coach Gerad Parker challenged Mayer to be more of a vocal leader this spring, and in giving him that challenge, they also gave him another line to add to his canned responses. His ability to offer the cliché as sincere would make Crash Davis blush. Consider this answer in April in response to a question about his thoughts on the Mackey Award, given annually to the best tight end in the country, an award he not only did not win in 2021 but was not even named a finalist for.

“I would say right now, I’m focused on being a football player, being the best football player I can be, being the best leader I can be,” Mayer said. “Whatever happens after that, that’s out of my control. I’m just going to try to be the best leader, be the best football player I can be.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Suggesting Mayer can and should exceed all those tight ends is bold in several ways. His effectiveness will depend on that arrival of an additional option. Comparing his stats to those from 12 years ago is a difficult endeavor given how offenses have changed, even if comparing to one that enjoyed a supposed decided schematic advantage back then.

“But it is the correct suggestion, nonetheless. In a shortened season led by a ball-dominant run-game, Mayer caught 42 passes for 450 yards. Simply stretch that into a 13th game and that is 46 receptions for 488 yards. That alone would exceed Rudolph’s 2009 (33 catches, 364 yards, 3 scores). It would rival Kmet’s 2019 (43 catches, 515 yards, 6 scores). It would not be all that far off from Eifert’s junior season (50 catches, 685 yards, 4 scores).

“And that is if Mayer does not progress at all, even when featured as Notre Dame’s lead receiving option.

“The last time the Irish returned an uncertain offensive line and little proven receivers, if any, was 2018. Miles Boykin had 18 career catches heading into that season, and Notre Dame needed to replace the all-time left-side combo of Mike McGlinchey and Quenton Nelson.

“Boykin finished that year with 59 catches for 872 yards and eight touchdowns in a breakout campaign as a senior. Such a stat line would outdo even Eifert’s excellent 2011 (63 catches, 803 yards, 5 scores as a sophomore). Outright expecting that of Mayer is quite an escalation, but consider that the baseline for what will eventually be a preseason prediction.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Captain, simply because if not now, then it will be never. All-American, Bower notwithstanding. Record-setter, breaking his own.

Not enough can be expected from Mayer in 2022. Predicting his successes risks underselling what may come next. Alas, a prediction should follow.

Defenses will focus on Mayer until fifth-year receiver Braden Lenzy or sophomore Lorenzo Styles makes them pay for it, but even if that never happens, those defenses will still have a problem: They do not have Kyle Hamilton.

It is not hyperbolic to say Hamilton was one of few — a handful, at the absolute most — collegiate defenders who could handle Mayer one-on-one in 2021, and by “handle,” what is really meant is, “get beat only half the time.” When sophomore quarterback Tyler Buchner looks for Mayer, he will see him open. At that point, it will simply be a question of Buchner putting the ball where Mayer can catch it.

A renewed Irish focus on the run and an unproven quarterback could work against Mayer putting up monster numbers, counteracting those mismatches. Thus, this prediction is more of a shot in the dark than last year’s eerily accurate one was.

No Notre Dame tight end has ever cracked 1,000 yards. If Mayer is anywhere near that pace in November, Irish head coach Marcus Freeman will encourage Rees to make it happen. But just as Kyren Williams needed a last-minute dash to the end zone in the regular-season finale at Stanford last year to reach 1,000 rushing yards, Mayer may need to reach four digits in just 12 games. Not to look to the end of the season before it begins, but consider Mayer unlikely to play in any non-Playoff bowl game.

That math comes down to 83.3 yards per game. Last year, Mayer had five games of more than 80 receiving yards, including two north of 100. Boldly doubling each of those would have Mayer needing to average 60 yards in the other two games of the season. In other words, he would have no room for error if chasing 1,000 yards.

It is more likely he ends up with 80-plus catches for 900 yards and eight or nine touchdowns. Hardly a disappointing season.

DOWN THE ROAD

And then, a first-round pick. If healthy, there is no doubt about it. Some NFL front offices let it slip in 2021 that they would have considered Mayer a first-rounder then, after just his freshman season.

And to think, the recruiting rankings did not consider him the top tight end in his class.

2022-23 year, eligibility: An incoming freshman, States has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Notre Dame has no shortage of tight ends, of course led by arguably the country’s best tight end, Michael Mayer. Sophomore Mitchell Evans will complement Mayer most often, but even between him and the incoming freshman duo there is another pair of tight ends on the depth chart.

Recruiting: Staes and classmate Eli Raridon committed to the Irish within a week in early May, continuing a Notre Dame habit of signing two tight ends in each recruiting cycle. Staes was considered the No. 8 tight end in the class by the end of the cycle, three notches behind Raridon. When Staes signed with the Irish in December, he was only the No. 23 tight end in the class, yet his eventual rise was foreshadowed by holding offers from the likes of Alabama, his homestate Georgia and Texas.

Staes initially committed to Penn State in August of 2020, a commitment that held up for six months and one that may have been rash during the dead period of recruiting in the pandemic.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Commitment videos are mostly rote, overdone and repetitive. Then there is Staes’ …

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN STAES SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“Staes’ 6-foot-4 frame underscores his wingspan, an ideal trait in a tight end. Combine that with his crisp routes and Staes may already be a college-level receiver. The Irish will not lean on him until he proves an able blocker, but that has often been the shorter learning curve for Notre Dame tight ends. …

“The Irish were quietly very high on both Cane Berrong and Mitchel Evans this season, even if only Evans saw much playing time of the two freshmen. One of them is likely to step into George Takacs’ role as the complementary piece to All-American Michael Mayer, leaving only third-string reps or H-back duties for Staes.”

2022 OUTLOOK

At fifth or sixth on the depth chart, it is hard to envision Staes making an impact in 2022. He should appear in four games, nonetheless, particularly given he could fit well on kickoff coverage teams.

Scout-team work could have a long-term dividend, in that early-enrolled freshman quarterback Steve Angeli will be throwing at that level in many practices, as well, giving Staes a chance to develop a rapport with a possible future Irish starting quarterback.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

DOWN THE ROAD

Presume Staes remains at tight end — his body profile could fit at boundary receiver, a position desperately lacking options at the moment. When Mayer heads to the NFL draft’s first round in 2023, Notre Dame will need to find a new all-around option.

Evans and current sophomore Cane Berrong both fit that description on paper, though Evans is still new to the position as a former high school quarterback. Raridon’s athleticism will draw many eyeballs in practice, as well. But Staes has the frame to be the all-around tight end needed.

In many respects, Irish offensive coordinator Tommy Rees likes a pseudo-receiver at tight end. Tyler Eifert served him well in his playing days, and he has gotten to enjoy the play-calling luxuries of Cole Kmet and Michael Mayer in his current role.

When realizing those are the three Notre Dame tight ends Rees has the most experience with, it is stark how big the shoes will be to fill.

WHY NO. 85?

Notre Dame quietly announced incoming freshmen numbers this week, including Staes at No. 85. This space’s guess was going to be No. 44, based on his high school jersey and thus the seemingly delayed entry in this series, but the 85 digits are more befitting a tight end who could line up as a receiver as often as not, and they are available after Takacs transferred to Boston College this winter.

Who will be the first athlete to strike a deal with a hospital or a surgeon following an injury? Perhaps it will be a cheap deal, as a thank you for the good care. Perhaps it will be a deal at proper market value, the medical side of it simply banking on its work earning some kudos. Either way, Bauman being able to get back on the field only two months after breaking his leg in practice would have been a ripe opportunity.

CAREER TO DATE

Bauman recovered from the broken leg in time to see action in three of Notre Dame’s four November games, as well as the bowl game last season. That came after playing in four games in 2020, making a single catch in both years.

2020: 4 games, 1 catch for five yards.

2021: 5 games, 1 catch for 10 yards.

QUOTES

There is an instinct to think Bauman’s leg injury could hold him back beyond last season, even though he returned for November action and the bowl practices. He would dispute that thinking.

“I feel great, 100 percent,” Bauman said in mid-April. “Obviously last year with the injury was tough, but we have a great training staff, so I was able to get with them. I feel back to better than I was before, so I feel great. I felt great this spring, just keeping on top of that rehab has been huge for me, so now I feel great.”

In some respect, Bauman had a chance to improve his game in a mature way from the sideline.

“I took that opportunity, not being able to do things physically, to work more on the mental side of things,” he said. “… Although I wasn’t able to physically be on the field, I was taking those reps. Watching the film, taking those mental reps and once I got back on the field, I could feel all that come to fruition. Made a world of difference, just taking those mental reps and seeing it translate onto the field in a physical way was big for me.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Any Notre Dame tight end conversation for the next two years begins with a focus on Mayer. Not to sound like a broken record, but he is that good. Barring injury, Bauman will not have an opportunity to be thee tight end at ‘Tight End U’ until Mayer enters the 2023 NFL draft.

“He will, however, have an opportunity to be the supporting tight end once (George) Takacs departs, presumably after 2021, if Bauman does not take hold of that gig this season. The further players get from high school, the less weight their recruiting rankings should carry, but Bauman was sought as a typical Irish tight end star. He was higher rated than either of the early-enrolled freshman tight ends looking to leapfrog him in the depth chart, Cane Berrong and Mitchell Evans.

“Bauman will have an impact at Notre Dame. But due to Mayer, the ‘When?’ of that could be truly down the road.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Bauman or Evans, one will be Mayer’s backup, and the other will be a piece of the offense, always just one snap away from being a core piece of it. Though a former high school quarterback, Evans’ 2021 may have given him the slight edge over the former highly-touted tight end recruit Bauman.

The key thing to remember is, no matter the pecking order of tight ends Nos. 2 and 3, they will remain behind a likely All-American who will be both the fulcrum and the engine of the Irish offense.

There should still be a role for Bauman, be it as the No. 2 or 3 tight end. A handful of catches is likely the minimum, with one perhaps coming in the end zone.

He’ll be gone after this season.

Then it will be Bauman’s time, along with Evans and sophomore Cane Berrong, not to mention the two incoming freshmen. Who will emerge as the new lead is a parlor game better suited for next winter, but its best clues will come this fall.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Thomas still has all four seasons of eligibility remaining after appearing in only three games as a freshman.

Depth Chart: Notre Dame’s dearth of receivers, let alone healthy receivers, could be to Thomas’ advantage. A strong spring has him in contention to be the starter at boundary receiver, though fifth-year Braden Lenzy may rotate there to better the path for sophomore Lorenzo Styles at field receiver.

Recruiting: Thomas’ quiet freshman season should not take away from his strong recruiting profile, in which he was ranked the No. 45 receiver in the class of 2021 by rivals.com. Thus, Thomas spurned most of the SEC, including his homestate Georgia, in choosing the Irish.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

The job description on Thomas’ Instagram page is “Photographer.” Sure, the bio then lists “Georgia | ND Football WR” — and worry not, the Georgia part is simply acknowledging where he is from — but the “Photographer” aspect is a touch different. Only a touch, though.

Kevin Durant has shown up on sidelines with a camera in hand, a credential around his neck. As has Ken Griffey Jr. More pertinently, former Notre Dame defensive lineman Isaac Rochell has found a passion for photography and some semblance of a partnership with Canon.

There may be a path to follow there for Thomas, a creative and enlightening one.

CAREER TO DATE

Thomas played in three November blowouts last season, failing to record a catch in any of them. As classmate Deion Colzie appeared in 11 games and made four catches for 67 yards, it seemed Thomas was falling behind on the depth chart. Then an impressive run-up to the Fiesta Bowl, even if that did not yield snaps, and an even more impressive spring catapulted Thomas back alongside Colzie, if not ahead of him.

That culminated with Thomas’ four catches for 39 yards in the Blue-Gold Game. To conclude this comparison, Colzie had only two catches for eight yards. Thomas’ most impressive moment in that exhibition may have actually been his blocking for early-enrolled freshman Jadarian Price on a screen pass-turned-touchdown.

As this clip hits the replay at 33 seconds, note No. 83 in the white jersey on the right of the screen sealing the sideline for Price’s getaway.

“Everybody goes to college thinking you’re going to play right away, but sometimes things don’t move your way or happen in the position room. I definitely want to play. I’m biting at the bit every day just getting better.” – Notre Dame WR Jayden Thomashttps://t.co/NTycB0RCtN — Patrick Engel (@PatrickEngel_) April 3, 2022

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Thomas’ long stride belies his athleticism, but it will reveal itself in due time. That stride will be best used in the field role, where plenty of space is available, not to mention his 6-foot-1 frame is a bit undersized for the boundary role as offensive coordinator Tommy Rees has used it.

“Lenzy may hold onto the starting role on the wide side through 2022, but after that, consider it up for grabs. While Thomas is not touted as much as the other two freshman receivers (Lorenzo Styles and Deion Colzie), a four-star prospect out of Georgia should be viewed with as much long-term optimism as nearly any other recruit.”

2022 OUTLOOK

The spring version of Thomas was tantalizing. A leg injury played a role in his hushed freshman season, as did the strong play of Kevin Austin. Now fully healthy and without any clear-cut starter ahead of him, Thomas broke through. He may not be towering, but he has a wide frame, its own version of a size advantage. He ran a 4.6-second 40-yard dash before arriving at Notre Dame, better speed than one expects when looking at him.

That combination is what the Irish had in mind when they chased the Peach State product. That combination could make him a 2022 starter. At the very least, he will be a contributor.

Notre Dame needs him to be.

When the Irish face Ohio State (104 days), they will have just six or seven healthy scholarship receivers. One of those will be a former walk-on, Matt Salerno. Another will be a freshman yet to partake in a single practice, Tobias Merriweather. The “or seven” will be sixth-year Avery Davis, recovering from an ACL torn in November. It seems increasingly likely fifth-year Joe Wilkins is not yet full-go after suffering a Lisfranc injury this spring.

Notre Dame will hardly have a two-deep depth chart at receiver, so each available will be needed.

And this spring suggested Thomas will be up to that task. If all he needs is chances like he got this spring, then he will have them. If he can produce — especially before Wilkins returns later in the season — then the Irish will continue going to him; they will have no one else to go to.

A dozen catches from Thomas this season may seem like minimal production, but that would be enough to force defenses to acknowledge him on routes, opening up the field for the likes of Lenzy, Styles and star tight end Michael Mayer. If he builds that out to 20 catches, then suddenly Notre Dame’s offense may be nearing a worthwhile hum.

DOWN THE ROAD

Lenzy should be gone in 2023. Davis certainly will be. Wilkins’ injury throws some uncertainty into his projections. But either way, the time will fully arrive for the Irish stellar 2021 receiver recruiting to pay off.

Pulling in a trio of four-star receivers was unlike Notre Dame of late. It had not snagged that many four-star receivers in one class since 2015. In the five cycles between those two classes, the Irish snagged a total of 5 four- or five-star receivers, lowlighted by not signing a single receiver in the class of 2019.

Things have bettered in this regard, or they at least seem to be, but for now, Notre Dame still needs to make the most of every possible perimeter playmaker it has on its roster. All three of Styles, Colzie and Thomas need to pan out for the Irish to sniff the Playoff in the next two or three seasons.

A full season of snaps with that dozen catches could propel Thomas into a strong offseason and such rewards.

CAREER TO DATE

Berrong saw the field against Wisconsin, Cincinnati and Virginia Tech before an ACL tear ended his year. Those three games were notable in that they were higher stakes than the usual four-game flyer protocol, implying Berrong was a bit further ahead physically than realized, even if only on special teams units.

QUOTES

Berrong’s rehab has reportedly gone well, perhaps a bit ahead of schedule since that October injury. If applying an optimistic nine-month timeline to his recovery, that would set him up for possible clearance in July or August. Irish tight ends coach Gerad Parker seemed to hold some of that optimism in mid-April.

“He’s doing everything he’s supposed to do,” Parker said. “The last six weeks, he’s really changed his body back from his rehab. He looks good right now and has got himself in a good position, body-type-wise.

“We’ve been able to get him on the ball machine in pre-practice drills. He has great, soft hands and catches it easy. He’s a great kid. He studies hard and prepares in the meeting room just like he would be coming out to pratcie, which I think tells you a lot about who he is. He’s preparing well and putting himself in position to come back and get healthy in the summer.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Mayer will continue to dominate this conversation through 2022, but (George) Takacs is likely elsewhere next season, opening up a chance to impress in Rees’ multiple tight end offense before the need is absolute and prevailing in 2023. For any Notre Dame tight end not already viewed as a first-round NFL talent, ‘down the road’ means 2023 and 2024.

“Berrong (and Evans and Bauman) will get his chance, but he has plenty of time to grow into that role and prove himself in practice before the Irish truly come looking for a contribution.”

2022 OUTLOOK

First, get healthy. Then, get comfortable on the repaired knee. That latter aspect can often be overlooked in these recovery timetables. Berrong’s knee went out on him in a practice. Trusting it again may not be an overnight task, even for a teenager.

But after that, Berrong’s downfield abilities could provide Notre Dame some needed relief among receivers. Yes, receivers.

No, Berrong is not about to switch positions, but among Bauman, Evans and Berrong, the last of those would look most comfortable lined up detached from the offensive line, a la a receiver. While the Irish have only six or seven healthy receivers heading into preseason practices, some variability will be necessary on the outside.

If Berrong can carve out a role for himself in that vacuum, he would not only be helping himself, but he could be giving Notre Dame’s offense a needed wrinkle.

That may sound like a pipe dream, but it is a distinct need on the Irish roster, so it is more a reality than a dream. The question will be if Berrong is ready for that unique role.

DOWN THE ROAD

Whether or not he finds some traction in 2022, Berrong will have his chance in 2023. All of Notre Dame’s tight ends will. Mayer will be gone, enjoying a starting role in the NFL. Behind him, presently, no one has proven himself.

Berrong’s unique skill set — unique compared to Evans and Bauman, in particular; less so once put alongside incoming freshman Eli Raridon, also recovering from an ACL tear — should give him an advantage in ending up as one of the top two tight ends, and as long as Tommy Rees is the Irish offensive coordinator, multiple tight ends will be needed in the Notre Dame offense.

CAREER TO DATE

The run through Irish left tackles to open 2021 may never be seen again. Freshman Blake Fisher started the opener … and tore his meniscus in the first half. In stepped Carmody, who made it one start before a sprained ankle reared its ugly head. Then it was Baker’s turn, and he enjoyed two starts before a concussion sidelined him. Carmody tried again, before Alt finally provided some stability at the position.

In the end, Baker missed only one week to the concussion, appearing in 11 games total, including the two starts.

That all came after he played twice as a freshman, in two blowouts.

QUOTES

As that injury bug tore through the left tackles in 2021, it also created a natural opportunity to consider all four underclassmen in one swoop. Entering last season, all four still had four seasons of eligibility remaining, and halfway through the season, they had all started at left tackle. A possible logjam could be foreseen, which led to narrative comparisons.

Then-Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly saw a luxury.

“I would say that we regard the four tackles, all the young tackles, as future starters for us in some capacity,” Kelly said last September. “When we’re talking Tosh, when we’re talking about Blake, when we’re talking about Mike, and we’re talking about Joe, we’re very blessed that we’ve got four young players that can play at a high level.”

Fisher was ruled out for the regular season pretty quickly, leaving the other three to compete for the starting gig moving forward. To open October, Kelly pointed out the differences between them.

“Each one of them has characteristics that allow them to compete at Notre Dame at the left tackle position,” he said. “None of them are finished products. You have great length with Baker, you probably have a little bit more athleticism with Carmody, and then maybe a little bit of both with Alt, but he’s young. So each one of them brings a little bit to the table, but none of them are finished products yet.

“Injuries have dictated what’s going on there, but youth is behind that, as well. We could probably have a conversation about upside and who’s going to be where in the future, but we like all three of them. It’s just that it’s still a work in progress.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“If Fisher proves wrong these doubts based on precedent, that is not a doomsday for Baker’s career at Notre Dame. If any school has proven it will develop offensive linemen, it is Notre Dame, meaning Baker has plenty of reason to be patient waiting for playing time. If he gets a chance to crack the Irish starting lineup, that is as good as a chance at hearing his name in the NFL draft.

“Not to mention, Baker’s primary need all along has been work in a collegiate strength and conditioning program. This summer should provide his first real chance at that. Impatience before letting that work pay dividends would be foolish.”

2022 OUTLOOK

No offense to Baker, but the Irish would undoubtedly not mind a season of relative health at left and right tackle, keeping him on the sideline. The run of injuries last year was unprecedented in recent times, and played a distinct part in Notre Dame’s early-season offensive struggles. Now with a young quarterback, a stable offensive line will be crucial.

To some extent, though, having Baker as a backup provides some stability. His two starts last season were not stellar, but they were promising enough. He has all the makings of a strong left tackle, should that opportunity arise.

It is more likely he spends the season working behind Alt and learning under returned offensive line coach Harry Hiestand.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

DOWN THE ROAD

Alt and Fisher look entrenched at left and right tackle, respectively. And it is quite possible both declare for the NFL draft after the 2023 season. Rare is the multiple-year starter along Notre Dame’s offensive line that is not already an NFL talent. Fifth-year center Jarrett Patterson absolutely would have been; sixth-year Josh Lugg is actually only a one-year starter to date, 2021.

Of course, things could alter that possibility for Alt and Fisher. Injuries obviously occur. Perhaps their draft evaluations are a touch low and the chance to work more with Hiestand could change those earnings a year later. With name, image and likeness profits off-setting some of that sacrifice, it suddenly becomes a more tenable path.

But it is possible both Alt and Fisher leave the Irish after 2023, opening up two possible spots for Baker to start in his final year of eligibility.

At most positions, that kind of wait would be intolerable, but on the offensive line, Baker has the luxury of knowing he is getting the best development available while at Notre Dame. He can ease his way toward his diploma and make a decision regarding a possible transfer once Alt’s and Fisher’s 2024 plans are more clear. If they will both remain in gold helmets, then Baker can look elsewhere for his starting chance. If one or both of them head to the NFL, he can offer minimal drop-off along the Irish line.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Coogan has all four seasons of eligibility yet remaining after not taking the field in 2021.

Depth Chart: While Notre Dame’s center position is in flux, Coogan is not knocking on the door. Once fifth-year Jarrett Patterson returns to full health (torn pectoral), Irish offensive line coach Harry Hiestand will have to decide if Patterson will become a four-year starter at center or if he will move to guard and senior Zeke Correll will take over at the fulcrum. Regardless of that decision, even offensive line utility man Michael Carmody would probably play at center before Coogan in 2022.

Recruiting: True centers are much like kickers in that recruiting rankings rarely give them much due, and that was no different for Coogan, a consensus three-star prospect. Nonetheless, when he chose Notre Dame, he did so at the expense of Stanford and Michigan.

The Irish never had much to worry about in Coogan’s recruitment. A lifelong Notre Dame fan, he did not need any visit to campus to make his choice, fortunate given the restrictions of recruiting during the pandemic.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Note the date on this Instagram post, right in the midst of absolute chaos around the Notre Dame program. To refresh your memory, Dec. 1 was 36 hours after Brian Kelly bolted south; that evening reports would confirm Marcus Freeman’s eventual promotion to Irish head coach.

Much like in his recruitment, Coogan’s confidence in Notre Dame never wavered.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Between his commitment last April and playing a senior season this spring, Coogan already improved his footwork. Along with clear size, Coogan has some foundational aspects that suggest his career is one to be high on in the long-term.

“At center, the long-term should be emphasized. Correll has just as many seasons of eligibility remaining as Coogan does, despite entering his junior year. Granted, the likelihood of Coogan preserving a season of eligibility in 2021 will offset those ticking clocks by a year, but Coogan will have time to wait — make that, time to develop, regardless.

“As is the case for nearly every freshman offensive linemen — early enrollees Blake Fisher and Rocco Spindler perhaps the exceptions as well as the driving reasons behind (Dillan) Gibbons’ transfer — Coogan needs that time to add strength. Logic suggests Correll will not use all four years of remaining eligibility: Sixth years are meant for players who need them due to lost chances, not for elongating football lifespans. By 2023 or 2024, Coogan should have that needed strength.

“Given the Irish currently need Coogan at center to simply fill out a depth chart, it is safe to presume he will have first crack at the real thing when Correll’s tenure is up.”

2022 OUTLOOK

A springtime meniscus injury that required surgery and cost Coogan nearly all of spring’s practices has him behind the proverbial eight-ball this year. That absence forced Hiestand to take a look at Carmody at center, and Carmody’s athleticism shined. (That may become a theme for Carmody until he finds a permanent home on the Irish offensive line.)

That likely elevated Carmody to the “break glass in case of emergency” role at center rather than Coogan.

There are worse fates. Coogan is only a sophomore, after all, and the entire idea of the emergency glass is to not be broken. Even if he had not injured his knee, Coogan was probably going to spend this season fine-tuning his game under Hiestand’s watchful eye.

DOWN THE ROAD

Coogan has all the makings of a powerful interior blocker. As he moved from tackle to guard in high school, his raw strength showed itself. The ability to deliver compact blows with severity is not all that common, and it is what makes for a worthwhile guard or center.

In other words, Coogan will demand playing time in due time. Patterson will be in the NFL next season, at which point Correll will take firm control at center, but for how long? Correll could play into 2024, though that would make him a sixth-year veteran. The universal pandemic eligibility waiver made such occurrences possible, but they remain impractical.

For roster construction purposes — even more so now that the NCAA has waived the single-year signee maximum of 25 players — Correll moving on after 2023 will be more practical. That would set up Coogan to start in his senior season with two years of eligibility remaining.

Recruiting: The No. 11 offensive tackle in the class and No. 221 overall prospect, per rivals.com, Chan ignored Boston College, Penn State and Syracuse as he committed to the Irish more than a year before he could sign his National Letter of Intent. That early and firm pledge served to curtail other suitors, as did coming from relatively talent-poor Massachusetts. Simply put, few programs mine the state in general, let alone small towns closer to the New Hampshire border than to Boston.

It has been wondered before. It will be wondered again until it no longer needs to be because it has become reality. When will the high school all-star games begin paying these players? Whether it is the Under Armour All-American Game or the NBC-aired All-American Game or the Polynesian Bowl, some nominal fee feels inevitable in the not-too-distant future.

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN CHAN SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“If Chan is considered the most ready of the group, let it be pointed out he still needs to develop — consider the existences of Blake Fisher and Joe Alt as freshman starters at tackle to be the exceptions that prove the rule. Chan’s size and length make him an ideal starter down the road. He has lower-body power already, but perhaps not the upper-body discipline needed to enter the Notre Dame two-deep in the next 12 months.

2022 OUTLOOK

Vague expectations show Chan as a reserve at right tackle in 2022, putting him behind sophomore Blake Fisher and junior Tosh Baker, though if injuries were to tear through the line (again), junior Michael Carmody would find his way onto the field long before Chan.

Which is to say, Chan should enjoy the typical freshman season that Fisher and Joe Alt did not in 2021. He will work on his technique under Hiestand’s tutelage, more of a need for this class than perhaps any other after so many of their 2020 seasons, their junior seasons, were turned upside down by the pandemic.

Chan has much of the lower body muscle one would want from a collegiate offensive tackle, but his upper body still needs to develop some punch. Working in the strength and conditioning program will also benefit him.

One thing neither Heistand nor strength coordinator Matt Balis will need to worry much about is Chan’s footwork. Assuredly, some of his exact steps may need fine-tuning, but someone able to deftly move around the post in a basketball game usually takes well to the exact steps at tackle. Exhibit A: Ronnie Stanley.

Happy to have hit the court with these guys ❤️ https://t.co/ZBaOSNUnBK — Ty Chan (@chansanity5) February 28, 2022

DOWN THE ROAD

Presume Chan preserves a year of eligibility in 2022. That will technically put him two seasons off the timetable of Alt and one off Fisher’s, but more likely, it will leave him with three seasons of eligibility when one or both of them head to the NFL after the 2023 season.

That is not meant to sound bold. It is simply the expectation of any multi-year starter along Notre Dame’s offensive line.

At that point, Chan will compete with Baker and Carmody for those roles. As hard as it is to fathom coming into the program just one year behind two talents as esteemed as Alt and Fisher already are, Chan’s timing will work out well.

Depth Chart: Alt will be Notre Dame’s starting left tackle this fall, after rising from fourth on that depth chart last season due to injury and then excelling when given that chance.

Recruiting: A recent Twitter post claimed 6.3 percent of three-star recruits from 2015 to 2018 ended up being drafted. If anything, that number feels high, but it goes to prove the prudence in chasing four- and five-star prospects, given 21.1 percent of four-stars and 59.4 percent of five-stars became NFL draft picks.

Alt will be one of the 6.3 percent, a hardly-sought three-star tight end in high school.

CAREER TO DATE

Once Blake Fisher tore his meniscus, Michael Carmody sprained his ankle and Tosh Baker suffered a concussion, then Alt got his chance at left tackle last season. He never relinquished it.

Alt played in all 13 games, initially appearing as an eligible tight end in Notre Dame’s biggest packages, swapping out his No. 76 for the No. 45. He then started at left tackle in eight games, beginning with Notre Dame’s trip to Virginia Tech. It is not a coincidence that the Irish began to find an offensive rhythm at that point, as well.

While some of that was a reflection of the lackluster late-season competition, it should also be noted Alt held up against the best pass-rush defense in the country in the Fiesta Bowl, part of a line that allowed only two sacks on 70 dropbacks against Oklahoma State, which led the country in sacks. For all the failings that led to that faceplant, Notre Dame’s pass protection was among them.

QUOTES

When Baker went down against Wisconsin, Carmody got the following start against Cincinnati, his ankle still bothersome. Alt eventually stepped in, somewhat shocking from a former high school tight end who was long seen as a project when he arrived at Notre Dame. The Irish coaching staff was high on him, very high on him, but they expected Alt’s development to take time. Even if they were willing to burn a season of his eligibility with those tight end cameos, that was more a testament to the dual realities of injury likelihoods and continued strong recruiting at the position.

The son of a 13-year NFL tackle warrants belief in his high ceiling, even if his growth spurt did not come until late in his recruitment. When Notre Dame first started chasing Alt, he weighed 240 pounds despite standing 6-foot-6. By the time he signed with the Irish a year or so later, he was at 280 pounds.

Then-head coach Brian Kelly acknowledged that anticipated time delay leading into Alt’s first career start. Those comments are worth remembering, simply because they show how quickly Alt exceeded expectations.

“I wish he’d become it tomorrow,” Kelly said, it meaning a polished left tackle, before adding why he believed Alt would become such in due time. “I think it’s his demeanor, if I had to point to one thing.

“He has size, he has a skill set, he looks like a tackle, he acts like a tackle. He has all those things, but I just love the way he does his job. He’s unflappable when he goes out there. We play him at tight end — change your jersey, put another number on — it doesn’t affect him. He goes in and does his job.

“Is he perfect? Absolutely not. But having said that, there’s a physicality to him that he brings that we really like that we feel we need at that position.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

Similar to repeating Kelly’s October thoughts to emphasize what the expected timeline was for Alt’s development, let’s take ownership of a wildly missed projection from last summer. Nuke LaLoosh was more accurate than this.

“As much as Notre Dame’s offensive line is in flux, its depth cannot be doubted. At tackle alone, the Irish have various reasons to believe in fifth-year Josh Lugg, junior Quinn Carroll, sophomore Tosh Baker and early-enrolled freshman Blake Fisher, not to mention junior Andrew Kristofic waiting in the wings. So there is no need for Alt to fret about 2021.

“A recruiting reach like this one on paper gains credibility when the supposed project is the son of a former All-Pro NFL offensive tackle who enjoyed a 13-year career. John Alt’s success should not be expected from Joe Alt, but some success may be, all the same.

“That will take time spent in the weight room and time spent waiting on Carroll, Baker and Fisher to wrap up their collegiate careers. Given Alt is currently on the same eligibility timeline as all three of them, that time will be in the realm of three or four years.

“At that point, presuming the absolute certainty Alt does not play in more than four games in 2021, he will have two seasons of eligibility remaining. It does not excite anyone to refer to 2024 as any incoming freshman’s first chance at contributing, but when the offensive line is as deep as Notre Dame’s, it is not a concern, either.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

If Alt was able to help solidify the Irish line, along with left guard Andrew Kristofic stepping in for Zeke Correll, with his size after just one summer in a collegiate strength and conditioning program, then all expectations should be fast-forwarded even further. It defies logic to think someone once projected as a possible 2024 contributor could now be a stalwart on the Notre Dame line in 2022, but Alt has made that a potential reality.

That is not meant to jump the proverbial shark or to move the figurative goal posts. It is just the possible continuation of Alt’s rapid ascent.

At the absolute least, he should start throughout the season, barring injury. His length was what made Alt an intriguing prospect as a recruit, along with his lineage. Taking so well to adding weight already should make him durable, as well.

He will give up some sacks, just as he did early in his first start, but that is the inevitability of the position. Under returned offensive line coach Harry Hiestand’s eye for fundamentals, Alt should correct those mistakes shortly after he makes them. That could make for a very impressive November.

DOWN THE ROAD

Multi-year starters on Notre Dame’s offensive line tend to hear their names in the NFL draft. In the rare instances in which they do not, they still end up on NFL rosters for years.

Since this Irish resurgence began in 2017, eight linemen have entered the draft after starting for multiple years. Six of them were drafted: Mike McGlinchey, Quenton Nelson, Aaron Banks, Tommy Kraemer, Liam Eichenberg and Robert Hainsey.

Only Alex Bars and Sam Mustipher were not, the former due at least in part to a torn MCL and ACL. But Hiestand then signed both during his two years with the Chicago Bears, and Bars became a part-time starter, while Mustipher remains on the roster.

Yes, fifth-year center Jarrett Patterson returned to Notre Dame this season after already starting for three seasons, but he would have been a draft pick if he had jumped to the NFL.

Alt will face that decision before long, and as a left tackle, it may be a more clear decision than it was for Patterson. When Alt ponders the 2024 NFL draft, he will presumably do so as a three-year starter for the Irish. That résumé line alone will make Alt a high draft pick. No one should advise against enjoying that opportunity.

Indeed, Alt’s timeline may now be so short that he could be gone from Notre Dame before he was originally expected to contribute.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sixth-year veteran, this will be Lugg’s final season, one granted by the universal pandemic eligibility waiver, along with the fact that he did not play as a freshman in 2017.

Depth Chart: The most likely starting offensive line for Notre Dame at Ohio State (97 days) will have Lugg at right guard, but it is conceivable returned Irish offensive line coach Harry Hiestand moves fifth-year Jarrett Patterson to right guard from center, leaving Lugg as the offensive line utility knife, called upon in case of injury at any of the five positions.

Recruiting: A consensus four-star prospect and U.S. Army All-American, Lugg committed to Notre Dame before the 2015 season. If slightly exaggerating the involvement of a pledge from a high school junior, Lugg will spend eight seasons as part of the Irish program.

When he chose Notre Dame over Alabama, Michigan State and Ohio State, Lugg did so on the advice of Hiestand, who was actually not only Lugg’s recruiter, but his first offensive line coach in 2017 before Hiestand headed to the Chicago Bears for two seasons.

CAREER TO DATE

Lugg served as an injury replacement in both 2019 and 2020, trusted at most offensive line positions, before he started all of the 2021 regular season at right tackle. A slight knee injury that required December surgery cost Lugg the Fiesta Bowl, where then-freshman Blake Fisher started in his place.

2017: Preserved a year of eligibility.

2018: Field-goal protection duties.

2019: Five starts at right tackle in place of injured Robert Hainsey.

2020: One start at right guard in place of injured Tommy Kraemer, two starts at center in place of injured Jarrett Patterson while the Irish coaching debated if it preferred Zeke Correll or Lugg at the pivot.

2021: 12 starts at right tackle.

In total, Lugg has played in 48 games in his career, putting him in the mix to tie Kurt Hinish’s record of career appearances at Notre Dame at 61, but he would need fifth-year linebacker Bo Bauer (51 appearances to date) to miss some games, as well as fifth-year safety Houston Griffith to miss at least one (49). Of note: Bauer has played in every game of his career.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Those high school All-American games serve not only to give star recruits some exposure and a chance to measure themselves against the other best players in the country, but they also give those players an opportunity to make some connections.

Lugg developed some relationship with the IATW Foundation (It’s About the Warriors), based in Lugg’s hometown of Wexford, Penn.

QUOTES

While a nagging back limited Lugg late in 2020, he has largely been healthy in his career. His NFL draft stock was not soaring after the 2021 season, part of the reasoning for his return, but it may never soar. A multi-year starter at Notre Dame will end up with an NFL career to at least some extent, but Lugg seems like he will be at peace if that possibility does not materialize.

He instead focuses on the younger linemen. He discussed the responsibility he feels in working with them last fall, and then again in January.

“I want to come back, I want to help Notre Dame win, I want to become a better version of myself and win the Joe Moore Award, and a lot of the emphasis is on how I can help these younger guys coming in, develop, just like Hunter Bivin, Mike McGlinchey and Quenton Nelson did for me when I was coming in,” he said.

“If I have another year where I can do that and help guys become Notre Dame men, then it’s definitely attractive to come back.”

That may sound like the kind of clichés that usually prompt a reference to Crash Davis, but Lugg offers them with a rare tone of sincerity.

“The most important things are our unit goals,” he said. “Help Notre Dame win, be the best version of ourselves and win the Joe Moore Award. If I really focus on that, then any personal goals that really aren’t as important as unit goals are going to fall into place.

“My mindset is really, help Notre Dame win, be the best version of myself each day, which is helping other people, and win the Joe Moore Award. If I have that in mind, then everything will fall into place.”

Taking all of that at face value allows for the possibility that Lugg could be knocked off the starting unit by Hiestand rearranging his pieces without causing any strife in the locker room. Lugg would simply keep working forward, despite losing that prominent role in his sixth season.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Lugg at tackle is a best-case scenario for him, and as much as Lugg has been a team-first player by stepping in wherever and whenever needed, by waiting his turn, he obviously hopes for some version of a best-case scenario for himself at some point.

“‘Being able to move and get my hands on you, use my length outside, and also be able to communicate my defense to the rest of the offensive line,’ Lugg said when asked why he was most comfortable at tackle, basically describing everything about the position in granular detail. …

“Here is a moment where perhaps the universal eligibility waiver during the pandemic could come into play. Lugg will have only so much film to show NFL front offices after this season. While it could be good enough to make him an NFL prospect already, it is more likely a second year of film could be useful.

“Notre Dame would have to have roster space, and that math is going to be a challenge simply because it is unprecedented, but a proven and talented starter at tackle is the type of building block to make an exception for.

“Otherwise, a healthy 2021 and Lugg’s length alone should make him worthy of a flyer by a front office at the next level.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Perhaps Hiestand moves Patterson to right guard, deeming the combination of Correll at center and Patterson at guard superior to Patterson at center and Lugg at right guard. Or perhaps that musing is the result of too much time to ponder during the summer.

It is most likely Lugg starts at right guard in Columbus, with Fisher and Patterson flanking him. The three of them combine to weigh 947 pounds. Patterson will be a preseason All-American and widely viewed as one of the — if not thee — best centers in the country. Lugg has experience, length and versatility, presuming his back holds up for a second year. Fisher is a generational talent based on the simple fact that he was the first freshman to start on Notre Dame’s offensive line in the season opener in 15 years and only the second to ever do so.

That could quickly become the strong side of Notre Dame’s offensive line. That is typically assumed to be the left side of the line, partly a nod to the usual elevated talent at left tackle and partly an Irish residual from the dominance of McGlinchey and Nelson in 2017. But there is no reason it cannot be the right side.

Notre Dame will run behind Lugg and Fisher with Patterson cleaning up behind them. It will pull Lugg to clear a path on the left side when variety is needed. Hiestand loves little more than setting a tone and then using a pulling guard to deliver a blow.

All while Lugg continues to mentor Fisher, sophomore left tackle Joe Alt, sophomore guard Rocco Spindler and the quintet of freshmen.

DOWN THE ROAD

Lugg has the measurables the NFL wants, and being a multi-year starter at Notre Dame provides him the pedigree. Hiestand will offer blunt and trusted assessments to front offices.

Lugg should get a chance. A strong 2022 could turn that chance into a mid-round pick, but he will probably end up an undrafted free agent, signing up for a few seasons of six-figure incomes before beginning his “real” life.

2022-23 year, eligibility: An early-enrolled freshman, Schrauth has four seasons of eligibility remaining, and five years to use them.

Depth Chart: Schrauth was recruited as a guard, and Notre Dame actually has a slight dearth of them at the moment. He could find himself on the two-deep behind sixth-year right guard Josh Lugg, though it would be somewhat a nominal placement, as junior Michael Carmody may be the backup across the offensive line. Furthermore, sophomore Rocco Spindler would likely be ahead of Schrauth if a backup guard was needed long-term, even if Spindler is listed as the No. 2 left guard.

Recruiting: As misguided and intrusive as much of the recruiting process can be, it can also serve as benchmarks in the college football timeline, just as much as notable wins do. For example, early-enrolled freshman defensive lineman Tyson Ford will long be remembered as the first commitment to Marcus Freeman as the Irish defensive coordinator, a pledge pulled in by Freeman at the last minute, flipping Ford from a strong Oklahoma lean.

Similarly, Schrauth will be long remembered as Freeman’s first stop as Notre Dame’s head coach. After his introductory press conference on a Monday in early December, Freeman and Irish offensive coordinator Tommy Rees boarded a flight straight for Schrauth in Fond du Lac, Wis. Days later, the No. 3 guard in the class and No. 86 player overall, per rivals.com, chose Notre Dame over his homestate Wisconsin.

Schrauth had debated between the two programs for months. Freeman’s push was the notable edge the Irish apparently needed.

QUOTES

Even Freeman remembers Schrauth as his first stop as Notre Dame’s head coach. He and Rees were ultimately on their way to the West Coast to visit receiver Tobias Merriweather to undo some of the damage done by Brian Kelly in his last stop as Irish head coach. Fond du Lac just happened to be on the way.

“As you became the head coach, you had to get with Tommy and the offensive staff, what do we need to do?” Freeman said in December, remembering those chaotic days. “Obviously getting Billy to sign here was huge, but keeping those four offensive linemen committed, too, was a big task for us.”

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Schrauth is nearly non-existent on social media, at least publicly. His Instagram boasts one post, his commitment to Notre Dame. He has tweeted just once this year, a pro forma post pushing an NFT-based Irish collective.

In other words, Schrauth displays the humility typical of most Wisconsinites.

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN SCHRAUTH SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“Schrauth [is a] respected mauler in the run game, suggesting [he] ends up at guard down the line.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Schrauth played through a left foot injury in his senior season of high school. No further damage was done, but it was enough of a concern that he had surgery on the foot within a week of arriving on Notre Dame’s campus.

Thus, Schrauth’s spring lifting was done largely one-legged. He missed all of spring practices.

He may have garnered praise similar to Spindler a year ago, seen as a worthy contributor if the offensive line needed him. Instead, the focus is now on Schrauth getting fully healthy.

A 300-pound teenager on a stressed foot warrants caution. There is no need to rush Schrauth back. Even if he could be listed on the two-deep, Notre Dame will have options at guard. From Lugg, Carmody and Spindler, there is also fifth-year center Jarrett Patterson. Some speculation already expects Patterson to move to guard (and senior Zeke Correll to start at center). If so, that is another body ahead of Schrauth in that pecking order. If not, any long-term injury at guard would immediately reignite such speculation, again dropping Schrauth down the pecking order.

For 2022, Schrauth may be out of the mix, but that should pay off for him in terms of health.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

DOWN THE ROAD

Lugg and Patterson will be gone next season. Correll and senior left guard Andrew Kristofic Will Likely be back, but nothing should be assumed. For this conversation, let’s presume both are, but Correll works at center.

Suddenly, Spindler, Carmody and Schrauth will be competing to start at right guard. Schrauth may be the youngest among them, but he is also the most prototypical guard. Much of that is his mentality. Schrauth just wants to hit people.

That is not hyperbole. He has said it. In discussing whether he’d like the paycheck that comes to tackles, Schrauth dismissed that incentive.

“It ain’t about that for me,” he said this winter. “It’s about hitting guys. I just like hitting guys.”

Let’s repeat that.

“I just like hitting guys.”

Put that on a t-shirt and give Schrauth some of the proceeds.

His time to do hit guys will come. Irish offensive line coach Harry Hiestand believes Schrauth will be full-go by August, at which point, his hitting will commence.

That kind of singular focus is best utilized on the interior of the line. Be it in 2023 or in 2024 once Kristofic is assuredly elsewhere, Schrauth will hit guys.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A senior, Kristofic has three seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Kristofic started the final seven games of the 2021 season at left guard, so until further notice, it is expected he will start there again when Notre Dame opens its 2022 season at Ohio State on Sept. 3 (in 96 days).

Recruiting: The Irish coaching staff first started pursuing Kristofic because it was devotedly recruiting his high school teammate, quarterback Phil Jurkovec. That gave Notre Dame a head start on the likes of Clemson, Ohio State and Wisconsin. By the time they were chasing the All-American and consensus four-star tackle, the Irish had been after him for quite some time.

CAREER TO DATE

Kristofic played in four games as both a freshman and a sophomore, none of the appearances particularly notable. Then halfway through the 2021 season, he stepped in for classmate Zeke Correll at left guard. The combination of Kristofic and then-freshman left tackle Joe Alt entering the starting lineup steadied the Notre Dame offensive line.

Then-head coach Brian Kelly repeatedly pointed to their size. Kristofic and Correll are both currently listed at 295 pounds, but Kristofic stands more than two inches taller, and Correll has long struggled to keep weight on.

QUOTES

Kristofic’s early-career cameos usually came at left tackle late in a blowout. His height, and respective length, combined with his quick feet appropriate for a high school basketball player all made him a prototypical future tackle.

But he was also moved around in spring and preseason practices to create a facsimile of depth along the offensive line. When a new look was needed at guard, Kristofic was clearly up to the task, not that he couldn’t have done it better.

Now, those reps at guard are exactly what Kristofic is using to improve his game at his newfound position.

“After playing guard for the second half of the season, it gave me a lot of things to work on at the end of the season,” he said in April. “Go back and watch the film of all the games I was in and really try to hone in the new position. Having time played in actual games now gave me a lot of good film to review.”

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

The continued lack of a deal with Bass Pro Shops for much of the Irish offensive line, more than a year after these delights first graced the internet, is one of the greatest failings of the early NIL era.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“If he impresses this preseason, he could become the line-wide utility man, a role that Lugg embraced the last two years and then buoyed him into a starting role. …

“The bounty along Notre Dame’s offensive line is so thorough it comes at the expense of players like Kristofic. A four-star once pursued by the sport’s blue bloods and the No. 32 offensive tackle in his class, per rivals.com, Kristofic enters his junior year entrenched as no better than the fourth Irish offensive tackle. Sophomore Michael Carmody, junior Quinn Carroll and even freshman Caleb Johnson all loom as candidates who could leapfrog Kristofic when Lugg finishes his career. Not to mention, the runner-up of the Baker-Fisher competition to start at left tackle in 2021 will be in the mix to step forward at right tackle as Lugg’s successor.

“But Kristofic could also presumably start at most programs in the FBS.

“Program growth like this is a good thing, and transfers with immediate eligibility make it so that growth does not cost individuals their chances elsewhere.

“A potential Kristofic transfer would not come before the 2021 season, and his play as the utility man could change this entire conversation, but a transfer at some point in 2022 might not be too shocking. With four seasons of eligibility remaining currently, his possible years of service available would be appealing to most teams.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Perhaps a mid-year position change to find a new starter should not be viewed as a long-term plan. Kristofic’s entry into the starting line last season unquestionably helped Notre Dame chase a Playoff berth, but that was more a move out of desperation than it was thought out.

Returned offensive line coach Harry Hiestand is not one to do anything out of desperation. He will weigh all his options heading into the 2022 season in order to have his line ready in Columbus, one of the few spots on that field where the Irish should actually have an edge.

That could include Kristrofic starting. It could include fifth-year center Jarrett Patterson moving to guard and Correll starting at the fulcrum. Hiestand has options.

In the middle of the summer, it is difficult to figure which of those options is most likely and which has current traction because … it is the middle of the summer.

Kristofic will get his fair shake, though. That is what has changed for him since August of 2021. Back then, there was never any thought of Kristofic as a starter. Now, the idea of him as a starter is one that Notre Dame is nothing worse than comfortable with.

DOWN THE ROAD

A year ago, the concept of a transfer was pondered at some point in 2022. That phrasing was deliberate, to suggest it could come following either the 2021 season or the 2022 season. Kristofic’s starting role last year ruled out the former, but the uncertainty heading into the 2022 season keeps the thought afloat that he may leave after this year.

There would be no harm in that, for him or for the Irish. Notre Dame has future guards, namely sophomore Rocco Spindler and early-enrolled freshman Billy Schrauth. Offensive line recruiting never slipped during Hiestand’s four years elsewhere.

If Kristofic looks at 2023 and doubts he will start, then he should transfer. It will be best for him, and he already has a degree in hand. He will have two seasons of eligibility remaining.

The numbers crunch very much still coming as players like Kristofic have an extra year of eligibility thanks to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver will make some of those transfers more valuable for the programs welcoming the players and more needed for the programs saying farewell. The concept of a former starting offensive lineman heading to play somewhere else may make fans uneasy, but it is best for the players to have that option. Notre Dame will be alright; there is plenty of talented offensive line depth to enjoy.

However, if Kristofic starts in 2022, returning to do so in 2023 could set him up to be an NFL draft pick, simply because multi-year starters along the Irish offensive line are de facto draft picks.

CAREER TO DATE

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Fashion icon.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“When (Josh) Lugg says, ‘What the standard is is the standard,’ he also endorses the Irish habit of slowly grooming offensive linemen. The possibilities of Fisher and Spindler aside, the expectation remains that an offensive lineman will work on his strength and conditioning, better his form and so forth for at least a season, more likely two. That allows him to get better and acknowledges the depth of Notre Dame’s offensive line.

“While more attention should be paid to Johnson than widely has been, a byproduct of Fisher and Spindler getting so much due, his time in 2021 will be spent in that prototypical fashion, far from any public focus. In particular, some fine tuning of Johnson’s footwork could go a long way in his development. …

“When Lugg heads to the next level, be it after 2021 or, thanks to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver, after 2022, a starting job will open at right tackle. Johnson will compete for that gig with the likes of junior Quinn Carroll and the runner-up in the current left tackle competition between Fisher and sophomore Tosh Baker.

“Johnson may seem the least likely candidate of those three or four, but an Auburn pledge deserves notice. The Tigers are a mercurial national power, but a national power all the same, one that has produced quality offensive linemen for years now. Johnson was not forced away from Auburn; this was not a de-commitment in optics only. He opted elsewhere because of the debacle that was the end of the Malzahn tenure (a situation that got only worse).

“Johnson will contribute to the Irish offensive line at some point. Even if he does not win that honor in 2022, his eligibility clock will be a season behind Fisher’s, and Fisher may spend only three years in college if his spring performance is any indication of what is to come.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Johnson’s concerns this season reach further than the early starring from Alt and Fisher. If they were the only hurdles between him and playing time, the chances of a sprained ankle would make being a No. 2 tackle a noted role. But with Baker and Carmody also well ahead of him, Johnson’s hopes of playing time dwindle, not to mention the tackle experience of sixth-year guard Josh Lugg and senior guard Andrew Kristofic, along with the all-around versatility entrusted in fifth-year center Jarrett Patterson.

Notre Dame would have to endure a rash of injuries that would warrant national headlines in order for Johnson to enter the starting lineup this season.

None of that is his fault. This is the risk run by joining a program as good at recruiting and developing offensive line talent as the Irish are.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

DOWN THE ROAD

A 2021 early enrollee, Johnson is readying for his third semester of college. He Will Likely be a semester from graduating, but with two seasons of eligibility remaining, when either Alt and/or Fisher declare for the NFL draft following the 2023 season. By then, Baker and Carmody will be entering their final years of eligibility as fifth-year linemen.

That paragraph includes a lot of uncertainty, and it fails to mention incoming freshmen Aamil Wagner and Ty Chan, but the emphasis should be on Johnson’s coming options.

When December of 2023 arrives, he should have an idea of his possible playing time in 2024. If not then, then by May 1, 2024. That will give him a chance to find playing time elsewhere if necessary, with a Notre Dame degree in hand.

A transfer should not be assumed. Johnson has the makings of a quality tackle. Falling behind Alt and Fisher should, in retrospect, have been assumed all along. Spending three seasons developing could have Johnson perfectly positioned to succeed one of them in 2024.

Depth Chart: Any injury along the offensive line could force Carmody into the starting lineup, be it directly or via a domino effect. In a literal sense, he should be on the two-deep as the backup at one of the tackle positions.

Recruiting: An All-American and consensus four-star prospect, Carmody chose the Irish over Auburn, Ohio State and Michigan, among many others. The Pennsylvania native spent much of his recruitment taking a hard look at his homestate flagship along with those other Big 10 powers, but his familiarity with Notre Dame always made a South Bend landing likely. Carmody’s older brother, Robby, has played on the men’s basketball team since 2018, though his career has been beset by injuries.

CAREER TO DATE

Carmody played in only the South Florida blowout as a freshman in 2020, making for his start one game into the 2021 season even more of a surprise. After Blake Fisher tore his meniscus in the season opener, Carmody stepped in at left tackle. Of course, he could not make it through that first start without spraining his ankle, and though he got a second start a few weeks later, that plaguing ankle cut that short, too.

In total, Carmody appeared in 10 games for the Irish in 2021, starting twice. That may not seem too notable, but being the first left tackle off the bench emphasized his broad standing, something that carried over to this spring.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Now this is good caption writing, more than anything else, but it is organic thoughts like these that should be capitalized on. WD-40 has not had a notable advertisement in Carmody’s lifetime. A small spend here would have garnered at least an afternoon of social media notice.

But in the meantime, Carmody and the rest of Notre Dame’s offensive line continue to show how easily NIL can be put to positive use, despite so many people’s hand-wringing over the idea of paying college students.

QUOTES

As the Irish sought a healthy left tackle just as much as a good left tackle last season, the differences between Carmody, classmate Tosh Baker and then-freshman Joe Alt were expounded upon plenty. In October, all three managed to be healthy. Notre Dame needed to turn to just one.

“Each one of them has characteristics that allow them to compete at Notre Dame at the left tackle position,” then-Irish head coach Brian Kelly said. “None of them are finished products. You have great length with Baker (standing 6-foot-8), you probably have a little bit more athleticism with Carmody, and then maybe a little bit of both with Alt, but he’s young.”

That athleticism of Carmody’s warrants continued notice as he becomes the Notre Dame offensive line utility man.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Carmody has all the tools wanted, they are just raw. That is to be expected from any sophomore, let alone current sophomores who lost many chances at growth and development during the pandemic.

“The Irish will need a right tackle in 2022, unless current senior Jarrett Patterson moves to tackle then after that was expected this offseason. In that case, then Notre Dame will need a right tackle in 2023, when Carmody will still have two seasons of eligibility remaining.

“He will get his chance, and it would be foolish to downplay that chance. The high school basketball player has the lateral quickness needed on the edge, and though his 6-foot-5 ½ frame might be small compared to (Josh) Lugg, it is plenty long enough to excel once given the chance.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Offensive line utility man may seem like a minimal role, but consider what it is referencing. A utility infielder sees plenty of action throughout the long baseball season, filling in wherever rest or injuries dictate the need.

And rare is the football season in which all five starting offensive linemen remain unscathed. Notre Dame started seven offensive linemen in 2018 and 2019, years where the initial line was made up entirely of NFL-quality players. The Irish needed eight starting offensive linemen to get through the chaotic yet abridged 2020 season and nine in 2021 thanks largely to the rash of injuries at left tackle.

During the current Notre Dame resurgence, only the Joe Moore Award-winning 2017 unit never suffered an injury, a unit that included two top-10 draft picks and six NFL-quality starters. Yes, six, because even if it never suffered an injury, freshman Robert Hainsey and sophomore Tommy Kraemer still worked within a timeshare at right tackle.

Thus, the utility man will almost certainly be needed.

If a tackle is injured, Carmody figures to step right in. If a guard is injured, that should be the most likely result, but returned Irish offensive line coach Harry Hiestand could instead indulge in some re-shuffling. At center, Carmody has worked the fulcrum in practices to create some semblance of depth, further testimony to the faith in his innate athleticism.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

DOWN THE ROAD

Utility man work need not be selfless. Learning each position eventually leads to playing time. Exhibit A: Josh Lugg. He was long in Carmody’s current role, which gave him the present ability to move between tackle and guard. That ensures Lugg a starting role while also giving Notre Dame options to craft its best offensive line.

Predicting where Carmody will start when depends on predicting many other dynamics, but this much is certain: The Irish will need at least two new starters in 2023, replacing Lugg and fifth-year center Jarrett Patterson. A third may be needed if current senior Andrew Kristofic both starts this season at left guard and departs following this year.

In 2024, up to two new tackles could be needed, given how quickly Blake Fisher and Joe Alt impressed and established themselves as freshmen last season.

Starting opportunities will come for Carmody. His work across the line will have him prepared for wherever he is needed.

Recruiting: Though a former walk-on in South Bend, Vinson could have enjoyed a scholarship at Army or had an easier, preferred walk-on path at Mississippi State or Northwestern. Instead, he took his time at Notre Dame, thus earning a scholarship before the Irish played in the Fiesta Bowl to end last season.

CAREER TO DATE

Vinson won the starting long snapper job in 2020, appearing in all 12 games that season after debuting in two blowouts in 2019. His first-string status remained unchanged in 2021, despite scholarship long snapper Alex Peitsch no longer being a green freshman.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Former Irish punter Tyler Newsome coined the nickname “Milk” for Vinson, an aspect of Newsome’s own quirky personality as he themed the entire specialists unit after cheese. A few years later, that nickname has worked out rather well for Vinson, not only as it has become so ubiquitous that he uses it to introduce himself to anyone around the football program, but also because it created this opportunity this past weekend …

QUOTES

Receiving that scholarship will not change Vinson’s work ethic. After all, he received it only after he informed head coach Marcus Freeman he wanted to return for a fifth season as a walk-on.

If anything, Vinson views the scholarship as incentive to work harder. He needs to prove the investment worthwhile.

“It has made me want to work even harder, because coming in here as a walk-on, you definitely have to prove something,” he said in mid-January. “Just because you get that check doesn’t mean that the work stops. It means you have to work harder, because you have to keep proving to yourself and the coaching staff why you deserve the spot and the scholarship.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Very simply, aside from perhaps a punt tackle or two, Notre Dame would rather you never think about “Milk” again. Thus is the nature of the long snapper position.

“That is the moral of this story. In 2020, long snapper debacles became a weekly occurrence. The national laughter was matched only by cringes as games devolved after the first bad snap led to a hesitant second snap and then an anxiety-riddled third.

“Vinson proving himself capable, let alone the starter, made it so the Irish could survive the pandemic without any long snapper panic.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Not much has changed from last year’s projection. Vinson has not been noticed during a game in two years as a starter. All Notre Dame really wants from him is for that streak to reach three full seasons.

Long snappers are a lot like pilot lights; you only think of them when the wind has blown something awry.

Maybe that’s a forced analogy, but any analysis of a long snapper is forced. Unless he is picking a fight just before the halftime whistle, the job is rather straightforward.

Vinson has handled that job well for a couple years now.

Could he be named a captain in 2022? It is not outlandish, only because he was in charge of one of the winter conditioning groups, always a subset of likely captains, but with two captains returning in fifth-year center Jarrett Patterson and sixth-year receiver Avery Davis — not that either is necessarily guaranteed that status for a second season, though it seems rather likely — there will be only a few other slots afloat. Vinson is not likely one of those two or three names.

RELATED READING: Michael ‘Milk’ Vinson keeps proving people right

DOWN THE ROAD

At some point, the roster crunch of holding two scholarship long snappers comes to a breaking point, and that Will Likely end any conversation of Vinson returning for a sixth season in 2023 even if he has that eligibility remaining.

But he will exit Notre Dame with a diploma and a few monograms. Not too shabby for a guy once nicknamed “Milk” because he was not aged enough to be lumped in with cheese honorifics.

NFL possibilities are slim simply because that level is not as particular about protecting long snappers. They have more blocking duties than they do at the college level, and in that regard, Vinson may be undersized.

72 Caleb Johnson, sophomore offensive tackle, former Auburn pledgeNo.","Listed measurements: 6-foot-2, 293 pounds, per Harvard’s 2021 roster.

2022-23 year, eligibility: Smith has one season of eligibility remaining, having played in three seasons for the Crimson.

Depth Chart: Smith was not on Notre Dame’s radar until the spring ACL tear suffered by junior Aidan Keanaaina. If that was the impetus to bring in Smith, then it is safe to presume he fits in at No. 2 or No. 3 on the nose tackle depth chart, behind senior Jacob Lacey and in competition with sophomore Gabriel Rubio, just as Keanaaina had fit.

Recruiting: The Ivy League does not allow graduate students to play, so Smith was seeking a transfer as soon as Harvard’s season ended on Nov. 20. Initially, he committed to Minnesota in January, expecting to enroll there in the summer for the fall semester.

Then Keanaaina was injured and the Irish came calling. Smith flipped his transfer commitment in April.

CAREER TO DATE

In three seasons, Smith racked up a total of 72 tackles across 29 games, earning All-Ivy League first-team honors in 2021.

2018: 9 games; 11 tackles with half a sack.

2019: 10 games; 21 tackles with two for loss including 1.5 sacks and one fumble recovered.

2021: 10 games; 40 tackles with five for loss including 3.5 sacks and two forced fumbles. Ended his Harvard career with six tackles against Yale, annually the biggest game in Ivy League play. (Full disclosure: This reporter was actively cheering for Yale.)

The Ivy League did not play at all in 2020.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

The Human Evolutionary Biology major from Harvard is likely not transferring to Notre Dame because he seeks lucrative NIL deals. Something about him — everything about him — suggests a focus on a quick graduate degree will set Smith up for worthwhile income within the next year.

QUOTES

Smith’s transfer could not have been easier from an admissions standpoint, given his undergraduate background. That played a role in the Irish so quickly and aggressively pursuing him after Keanaaina’s injury.

“We just needed a little bit more depth,” defensive coordinator Al Golden said in April, days after Smith’s commitment. “So when Chris became available — obviously, a kid that met our profile, so we thought the transition would be smooth for him. When he demonstrated he was interested, that obviously piqued our interest.”

Of course, Smith’s solid play at Harvard also played a role.

“Just a big, strong, physical guy,” Golden said. “We needed an inside guy. He played well for them both in his ability to anchor but also in the movement skills.

“He was looking to do this for one year and make an impact somewhere. We think he can help us.”

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN SMITH COMMITTED

“At 6-foot-2 and a shade under 300 pounds, Smith may appear undersized to hold up at the next level of college football, but he sheds his first block quickly with clean hand action. He is disciplined in his pursuit of a quarterback, and on running plays, Smith absorbs his block, allowing the linebackers to track down the ball carrier.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Smith may surprise anyone who dismisses him as an FCS-product. He will not be asked to play every snap of the game. Notre Dame needs 20-30 quality plays from him each week, and he has enough experience that it should not be a problem.

Smith is a quick-twitch player, quicker than the usual nose tackle. He may be undersized, but he is strong and fast. Especially against lesser offensive lines this season — so, anyone outside of Ohio State, BYU and Clemson, with the Tigers the weakest of those three — Smith’s stature will not be a concern.

Lacey was the backup nose tackle last season, making 12 tackles in 11 games with two for loss, though Howard Cross took some of his snaps, as well. Smith should add 15 or so tackles this season, and that will be the tangible measurement of the needed depth he provides.

DOWN THE ROAD

Smith will not rule anything out, but his chances of jumping to the NFL are slim. If more viable, he would have looked for a transfer opportunity where he could start. Barring multiple injuries, he will not start for the Irish.

But, as alluded to up top, something suggests he will be just fine down the road.

WHY NO. 65?

Simply enough, he wore No. 65 at Harvard, and as long as Smith does not line up on the punt or field goal coverage teams, not a usual waystation for a defensive tackle, there is no risk of him overlapping with long snapper Michael “Milk” Vinson, also sporting No. 65.

2022-23 year, eligibility: An incoming freshman, Wagner has four seasons of eligibility remaining, and five years to use them.

Depth Chart: Projected as a future tackle, Wagner will not crack the two-deep this season, barring a string of injuries. At left tackle, for example, sophomore Joe Alt and junior Tosh Baker are well established as Nos. 1 and 2.

Recruiting: Wagner was the rare unexpected commitment back in November. Nowadays, even when a recruit has a hyped announcement and there is vague uncertainty remaining on his final decision, the two or three schools in the mix know they are in the mix. When Wagner announced he’d head to Notre Dame, it was entirely anticipated he would choose Kentucky, where his brother is a graduate assistant and the Wildcats have developed strong running games for a few years now.

The No. 12 offensive tackle and No. 126 prospect in the class by the time the cycle was concluded, per rivals.com, Wagner also pondered Penn State and Ohio State.

Some credit must be given to Wagner coming from Wayne High School, where both Marcus Freeman and cornerbacks coach Mike Mickens graduated from. They may not coach his position, but they lend some familiarity to Wagner.

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN WAGNER COMMITTED IN NOVEMBER

“adding another long-armed, broad-shouldered, powerful four-star tackle to a class that already includes consensus four-star Ty Chan (Lawrence Academy; Groton, Mass.) is a recruiting win that fits in line with Irish roster construction trends for years now.”

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Let’s skip the meandering thought process of finding a potential sponsorship deal for a player yet to enroll and instead relish the frivolities of high school sports that we did not get to widely enjoy before social media.

The first week of practice one of the girls said “Hey Coach, when we won conference, can we dump water on you?” I happily said yes! So proud of these young ladies! @AamilWagner thanks for the help picking up the water cooler! https://t.co/joJQRV7sFt — Nick Minnich (@N_Minnich) February 11, 2022

2022 OUTLOOK

Notre Dame ripped through so many left tackles in 2021, it feels foolhardy to now say it will not need Wagner in 2022, but the former shock created the latter certainty. The Irish know they have viable tackles in Alt, Baker, junior Michael Carmody and sophomore Blake Fisher. Furthermore, sixth-year right guard Josh Lugg has a year of starting experience at tackle, and fifth-year center Jarrett Patterson was originally recruited as a tackle.

Time sidelined will serve Wagner well. As strong as he is, he needs to add weight. A 6-foot-6 frame holding 260 pounds is simply not going to hold up at this level of football.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

DOWN THE ROAD

But note, Wagner is strong. He just won the Division 1 shot put title in Ohio, heaving the put 64 feet and one inch. That is a 12-pound weight thrown more than 20 yards. Second place threw his shot put 58 feet and 7 ¼ inches.

Even harder to believe, Wagner has been throwing for only two years, quickly picking up a skill that is highly dependent on picture-perfect form.

RELATED READING: Unfinished business drives Irish incoming freshman OT Aamil Wagner

Wagner has power.

With a basketball background, he also has quick feet.

All of which is to say, Wagner will be looked at as a future left tackle for the Irish, a designation that comes with it first-round draft thoughts. Wagner will have to wait until at least 2024 to get his shot at that role, but as long as that possibility exists, he will have plenty to work toward.

In his case, that work will involve plenty of weight training and massive plates of food. Bulking up from 260 to 305 will take some time, years even, to do it right.

WHY NO. 59?

If Wagner indeed plays tackle at the next level, then this number is almost certainly wrong. Just about the only NCAA numbering guideline followed religiously is that tackles have numbers in the 70s. The only numbers in that decade currently available on the Irish roster are Nos. 77 and 71. Chan wore 77 in high school, thus he was penciled in appropriately in this series. Wagner may end up with No. 71, but for now, let’s acknowledge his high school digits one more time, numbers that are unclaimed on Notre Dame’s roster card.

2022-23 year, eligibility: An incoming freshman, Craig has four seasons of eligibility remaining and five years to use them.

Depth Chart: The fluid depth chart spreadsheet used by this space has Craig listed as the fifth center on Notre Dame’s roster, though there are only three other centers on the roster, at most. The Irish would move someone else to the fulcrum before turning to the incoming freshman in competitive game action.

Recruiting: Craig shined at a camp on campus, doubly notable as it immediately followed the 15-month dead period in recruiting induced by the pandemic. That showing earned the consensus three-star offensive lineman a scholarship offer, and he took Notre Dame up on that offer within two weeks rather than head to Nebraska, Michigan, Vanderbilt or Cincinnati.

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN CRAIG COMMITTED A YEAR AGO

“Craig’s strongest trait is some natural quickness, amplified by footwork fine-tuned in basketball performances, ones so worthwhile they are included on his highlights page. He will most likely take that quickness inside at Notre Dame, widely expected to play center. At 6-foot-5, he will provide the size inside that the Irish have gotten used to the last two seasons with 6-foot-4 ½ Jarrett Patterson starting at the pivot, now succeeded by 6-foot-3 Zeke Correll.”

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Some things may be beyond monetization, like the sheer dominance displayed by Craig’s comparative size in this photo.

2022 OUTLOOK

Enjoy the food, enjoy the gameday atmosphere (at home games only), get used to college life, and lift a lot of weights.

That’s all that is ahead of Craig this season. A high school right tackle — and defensive end — he has plenty to learn as he moves into the interior, so there is no version of this season where Notre Dame turns to him already. Craig not only has to put on weight, but he also has to learn his new position.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

DOWN THE ROAD

Craig will have time to learn this new gig. Correll has three seasons of eligibility remaining, and while he may not play at the collegiate level into 2024, at least two more years of him in the center conversation at Notre Dame seem quite likely.

Post-Correll, Craig will need to compete with current sophomore Pat Coogan, more a natural center, particularly in size.

If that is the primary competition, though, then Craig will very much be in the mix. For an incoming freshman making a position switch, a pathway to playing time that clear is rare.

WHY NO. 57?

Editor’s Note: The original version of this story was published before Notre Dame announced Craig would wear No. 58 this season. That version guessed at his jersey number.

Craig wore No. 54 in high school, but the Irish already have a pair of 54s in sophomore right tackle Blake Fisher and senior defensive tackle Jacob Lacey. Craig could wear No. 53, perhaps, but in some intangible way, No. 57 better fits an offensive lineman.

Of particular note in retrospect, Georgia chased Ademilola as it put together last year’s generational defense. A consensus four-star prospect and U.S. Army All-American, Ademilola also pondered Michigan, Alabama and Ohio State.

CAREER TO DATE

Ademilola has been a contributor since he arrived at Notre Dame, though that was partly a nod to the Irish lack of depth on the defensive interior back in 2018, especially once Myron Tagovailoa-Amosa broke his foot in the first game of the season. Ademilola took over as a starter in 2021 when Tagovailoa-Amosa moved out to “Big” end, a decision made knowing Ademilola was ready to be a starter. Frankly, he could have started in 2020 if not limited a bit by a slight meniscus tear.

Similarly, a shoulder injury plagued Ademilola much of 2021, something he played through with little ill effect.

2018: 12 games; 19 tackles with 1.5 for loss including half a sack.

2019: 11 games; 25 tackles with four for loss.

2020: 8 games, 3 starts; 11 tackles with 1.5 for loss including half a sack.

2021: 13 games, 13 starts; 49 tackles with eight for loss including 3.5 sacks and one forced fumble.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Ademilola and his twin brother, end Justin, were quick to capitalize on NIL rights last year, managing to do so in understandable ways before delving into the uncertainty of NFTs.

QUOTES

Ademilola reportedly received a “return to school” grade when he sought an NFL draft evaluation, though all that really means is he would have likely been a day-three pick. There was still an NFL opportunity available to him if he wanted it. Instead, he opted for a fifth season, a choice coming between the promotion of Marcus Freeman as Notre Dame’s head coach and the abrupt departure of defensive line coach Mike Elston for Michigan.

More pertinent than those coaching changes, Ademilola timed his announcement in short order with twin Justin and senior Vyper end Isaiah Foskey. Bringing all three back to lead a line — a line that unquestionably has other threats in junior Big end Rylie Mills and senior nose tackle Jacob Lacey, among others — gives the Irish one of the best defensive lines in the country in 2022.

“The decision to return with my brother and Isaiah to come back was great,” Ademilola said in January. “The excitement I have for next season is at an all-time high, just knowing the guys in the room, we love to go at it. We love to get after the football, we love the game. These are my brothers that I’ve been with the whole time, and being with the guys in the room and all of us learning off each other, we can’t wait to start up again.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Forecasting a defensive tackle’s stat line is a treacherous task, as a successful defensive tackle often creates more opportunities for linebackers and defensive ends than for himself. That said, aside from broad defensive success, one area to look at to discern Ademilola’s effectiveness in 2021 will be his sack count.

“Whether it be by benefiting from group sacks or by getting into the backfield on his own, a starting defensive tackle should make at least a few sacks throughout a season, if not five or six. Given Ademilola’s long-established pass-rush abilities, that latter range would be more fitting.

“He may well have a productive season and make only one sack. If Freeman’s defense is successful, Ademilola will have much to do with it, simply via the nature of his position. But a dominant defensive tackle gets to the quarterback, something Ademilola has not yet done, nor necessarily had the ample chance to do. …

“A fifth season was never expected from a defensive tackle recruited as heavily as Ademilola was, but that may become the case.

“If he plays well enough in 2021 to earn a second- or third-round draft grade, Ademilola should head to the NFL. Football lifespans are too short to try to turn that into a first-round grade when a paycheck and a chance to prove himself at the highest level await. But anything lower than the third round and Notre Dame would gladly welcome back an established starting defensive tackle, both for his abilities and the depth his return would create.

“There are some 2022 possibilities created only by the universal pandemic eligibility waiver that will be meaningless in South Bend; maybe those players transfer and capitalize elsewhere, but the Irish will not compound their roster construction to exhaust those careers. Ademilola is not one of those players.

“Notre Dame will take every snap he can give, but that should not come at the young man’s expense.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

The thought that Ademilola amassed 49 tackles with eight behind the line of scrimmage last season while injured for some of it is a thought that should terrify Irish opponents in 2022. He has not looked to make an excuse of it, but his shoulder injury was enough of a concern that surgery soon after the Fiesta Bowl kept Ademilola out of all of spring practices.

“This kind of happened in the beginning of the season,” he said in January with his arm in a sling. “It didn’t slow me down from playing throughout the whole season. It was something that toward the end of the season, I knew I could get it cleaned up if I chose to, and I decided to get my shoulder cleaned up so I can move forward and be an elite player starting next season.”

Take Ademilola at his word that the shoulder was never an issue on Saturdays, and his 49 tackles should be viewed as a baseline in 2022. Read between the lines of what he said and realize he somewhat thinks that shoulder injury kept him from being “elite” next season. If that veiled modesty acknowledges such a truth, Ademilola could have a truly dominant 2022.

The combination of him and likely first-round draft pick Foskey will terrorize opposing quarterbacks. Foskey will get the headlines as he once again chases Justin Tuck’s school record for sacks in a season (and in career), but Ademilola may prove just as disruptive.

If he has 40-plus tackles once again and manages a few more sacks, then Notre Dame’s defensive line will surely be as dangerous as advertised, the foundation on which new defensive coordinator Al Golden will build his entire attack. Frankly, this will be the best unit on the Irish roster in 2022, and thus it may determine just how good Notre Dame can be.

DOWN THE ROAD

Barring further injury — and a slight meniscus tear bears no correlation to a bothersome shoulder, so no one should label Ademilola as “injury-prone” — Ademilola should hear his name in next year’s draft. His 2022 will very much determine how early.

A season with half a dozen sacks and undeniable explosiveness could move him into the second day. A season merely as good as 2021 would likely keep Ademilola in the fourth- or fifth-round. But either way, he has long shown he is a strong starter on a top-10 program in the country. That pedigree alone warrants drafting.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A senior, Cross has three seasons of eligiblity remaining, in part thanks to playing in only four games as a freshman in 2019 and in part thanks to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver.

Depth Chart: Cross Will Likely appear as the backup to fifth-year Jayson Ademilola at the three-technique tackle position, but he could functionally be the No. 2 nose tackle, as well.

Recruiting: The Gatorade New Jersey Football Player of the Year in 2018, Cross chose Notre Dame over plenty of Big Ten and ACC offers, including Michigan, Northwestern and Boston College. The son of a former NFL tight end, the consensus four-star prospect was rated the No. 27 defensive end in the class, per rivals.com.

CAREER TO DATE

Cross broke out in 2021 with 22 tackles in 11 games, including 4.5 tackles for loss with three sacks, all while still in a reserve role. He most shined in November as Ademilola’s nagging shoulder slowed him a bit more and the Irish as a whole began to tire. In Notre Dame’s four games from Halloween Eve to mid-November, Cross racked up 12 tackles with three sacks.

2019: 4 games; 7 tackles.

2020: 12 games; 13 tackles.

2021: 11 games; 22 tackles with 4.5 for loss including three sacks.

QUOTES

This reporter’s high school won the football state championship his senior year of high school. (Nope, not on the team.) Its nose tackle was an intense son of a military man, standing all of 5-foot-6, and that might be generous. In the winter, he wrestled at a weight class somewhere in the 140s or 150s. In no way was he your typical nose tackle.

But pound-for-pound, no one on that team or any opposition could match him for muscle, let alone frightening intensity.

Cross evokes some of those same concepts, something new Irish defensive line coach Al Washington is encouraging Cross to embrace.

“He sees me for my size, and that’s in a good way,” Cross said this spring. “It should fire me up, because I’m small.

“I’m excited for the season, but it’s the same thing as last year. I’m trying to work on my get-off, I have to work on my pass rush and everything like that.”

Some of Washington’s encouragement may come from his own background, standing 6-foot-1 as a former defensive lineman at Boston College.

“I was an undersized D-tackle, I’m partial to [Cross],” Washington said. “Howard Cross is a beast. He’s an explosive kid. He can generate (push). He’s productive because he can create separation. …

“He’s hard to deal with. He’s very disruptive.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Cross’ height is not the mitigating trait it can be made out to be. Does it mean he is not as present in as many passing lanes? Absolutely. And he cannot reach out and cut off a running back out of nowhere.

“But Cross’ active abilities nonetheless make him a strong defensive tackle. He can absorb and maintain a block, the skill that first earned Hinish playing time back in 2017. And Cross’ strong hands allow him to shed those blocks when needing to get into the backfield.

“In the backup role in the middle, Cross will still get plenty of action. He took 166 snaps in 2020, a number that should only rise with a year’s development and fewer overall uncertainties.

“Realizing Cross took only 166 snaps in 2020, his effectiveness is clear. Making a tackle on nearly 8 percent of your plays is a sign of involvement. If he keeps to that rate, 2021 could include 20 or so tackles.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Let’s look at Cross’ 2022 possibilities through the numbers, given that prediction last season ended up so on the nose.

He took 330 snaps in 2021, making 22 tackles. That came a year after making 13 tackles on 166 snaps. The percentage of snaps on which Cross made the tackle fell to 6.7 percent from 7.8 percent in 2020, but that should always have been expected as sample size increased. Making a tackle once every 15 plays in which you are on the field warrants some praise when one of your primary duties is to make it easier for other players to make tackles.

Cross’ 2021 did not jump off the page at any point, but it still warranted some praise. He was the backup at both nose tackle and three-technique, focusing more on three-technique as the season went along.

Washington will need to find ways to get Cross onto the field in 2022. His hands alone demand that playing time, able to knock an offensive lineman back with one shot. Rotating Cross in at both nose tackle and three-technique will serve that need, while also assuring both Ademilola and senior nose tackle Jacob Lacey adequate rest.

That may not lead to many more snaps than 330. Extrapolate that action across 13 games rather than 11 and it boosts Cross’ prorated 2021 count to 390 snaps. That could have been good for another four tackles from the interior force.

Raise that thought to 30 tackles this season, simply as a nod to development, but remember Cross’ greatest impact is not statistical. He provides Notre Dame dynamic depth, a luxury formerly unknown for the Irish as recently as 2017 and 2018.

How NT Howard Cross III packs a big punch despite his smaller stature

DOWN THE ROAD

Ademilola can play in 2022 only due to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver, theoretically setting up Cross for a starting role in 2023, but in order to grasp it, he will need to prove an unquestionable ability to penetrate the offensive line time and time again. As much of a nuisance as Cross has been inside, his size will work against him in wrapping up players in the backfield, a must for the primary three-technique tackle.

To be clear, Cross made 4.5 tackles behind the line of scrimmage last season. Clearly, he has not outright struggled in this regard. The expectation is he will fill Ademilola’s shoes.

The Irish would need to get creative to find some other Ademilola successor — perhaps moving current junior Rylie Mills back inside from “Big” end or maybe fine-tuning current sophomore Gabriel Rubio’s pass-rush abilities — but options will exist if Cross has not proven that skill.

Recruiting: Former Irish offensive line coach Jeff Quinn made Patterson his first focus. The rivals.com three-star prospect had been a longtime Arizona State commit, but then reopened his recruitment and narrowed it down to Notre Dame and UCLA, choosing the Irish just before National Signing Day.

CAREER TO DATE

Patterson preserved a year of eligibility in 2018 before taking over as the starting center in 2019. Recruited as a tackle, moving him to center was an avenue to get the best five linemen on the field, always a focus at Notre Dame and doubly so now with Harry Hiestand returned as the offensive line coach.

Patterson excelled in 2019 before playing even better in 2020, not giving up a single sack in 536 snaps in eight games before a broken foot cut short his season.

2018: 3 games.

QUOTES

Patterson’s torn pectoral that cost him this spring can be seen as a concerning loss, but there is every expectation he is fully healthy before preseason practices, at which point the injury may have even given Notre Dame a silver lining in in that it forced experimentation in the spring.

Regardless, it should not be viewed as problematic for Patterson’s long-term health. Missing this spring and the end of the 2020 season with entirely unrelated injuries does not make him injury-prone, though that was his biggest concern in returning to college for 2022 rather than jumping into the NFL draft.

“For me, a big concern was risk of injury because I had a serious one [in 2020], but putting it in perspective, it’s such a small freak thing that happened,” Patterson said in January. “Once I reached certainty and thought of other great O-linemen that came back for a fifth year here, I kind of knew that was the best thing for me to do.”

Patterson’s personal intention is to develop enough this season to be a clear starter from the outset of his NFL career.

“Just being more consistent, a dominant player on a consistent basis,” he said. “I showed flashes of that and had it, but just doing it all the time now and kind of reinforce the other guys in the group and the rest of the offense. That’s the next step I need to take.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

The more things change, the more they stay the same …

“Notre Dame’s complete faith in Patterson allows it to remain uncertain where he will play in 2021. With him, the Irish offensive line was the best in the country last year. Without him, it was merely very good. Some of that ties to the chemistry needed for an offensive line to excel, but some of it was also simply that Patterson is that good.

“Creating that chemistry anew will mandate Notre Dame come to a decision early in August. If not the first week of preseason practices, no later than the second week.

“It seems most likely Patterson ends up at right guard, forming a veteran tandem with (Josh) Lugg on the right side and a mauling interior with junior center Zeke Correll. In that alignment, the Irish will be able to buy the younger left side some time to adjust to the collegiate game by leaning on the right side in the most critical of moments.

“But by season’s end, Patterson’s success will be best demonstrated by the entire line succeeding. Quinn has proven an ability to develop such a line; it is just a bit murkier this time around. …

“The universal pandemic eligibility waiver means Lugg has two years of eligibility remaining and Patterson has three. If Lugg wanted to return in 2022, Notre Dame would not turn down that luxury.

“In that instance, Patterson could start at guard for two seasons, prove himself as a four-year starter with NFL abilities and multi-positional flexibility, and head to the draft along with Lugg after the 2022 season.

“But if Lugg instead follows a more normal timeline and tries his hand in the NFL after this coming season, then Patterson could finally get his chance at his originally intended position, tackle.

“One way or another, Patterson provides the Irish unique flexibility.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Patterson will start. Let’s be clear about that. He has been ahead of the recovery timeline on his injury since April. Diligence this summer should have him looking like he did not miss a beat by August.

The easiest choice will be to start the possible All-American at center, where he has started for three seasons with great success. Doing so will give Notre Dame a known, trusted commodity at the pivot of its offense.

One would think the descriptor “returning starter” has a clear connotation, but preseason hype can misuse it a bit along the offensive line. Is sophomore right tackle Blake Fisher a returning starter because he started the season opener at left tackle and the Fiesta Bowl at right tackle? That may be a stretch. But even without Fisher, the Irish return four starters along their offensive line, and playing Patterson at center allows those four to be joined by Fisher.

Those five have 71 career starts. Leaning on that experience would be an easy choice to make, and a readily defensible one, at that. By no means should “easy” be misconstrued as “wrong.”

But Hiestand may get creative, hence the “easy” designation. If senior left guard Andrew Kristofic left Hiestand wanting this spring, then moving Patterson to left guard could create a better line in totality. (And the career starts along the starting line would actually rise to 72 by plugging in senior Zeke Correll at center.)

The choice essentially comes down to a math equation. Which is greater? Kristofic at left guard plus Patterson at center or Patterson at left guard plus Correll at center?

The thought remains a hypothetical until Patterson returns to the practice field. The only certainty is Patterson will start.

Patterson so considered the NFL this winter, and likely would have been a mid-round draft pick, that it will be a shock if he does not take that leap after this season. He could work his way into second-round consideration under Hiestand’s tutelage.

Patterson wants to start in the NFL early on. If he is indeed at that level, he will not last long in the draft.

Depth Chart: Lacey should start preseason practices atop Notre Dame’s depth chart at nose tackle, backed up by Harvard transfer Chris Smith and sophomore Gabriel Rubio.

Recruiting: A consensus four-star prospect, Lacey was the first commit in the Irish class of 2019, doing so in July of 2017. The No. 21 defensive tackle in the class, per rivals.com, Lacey chose Notre Dame over finalists Clemson, Louisville, Michigan, Michigan State and Tennessee.

CAREER TO DATE

Lacey’s 2020 was undone more by the pandemic than most players, struggling a bit with the coronavirus in the preseason and then impacted by a balky shoulder. Yet, he played in 11 games as a sophomore, the same number he played in as both a freshman and a junior. The interior presence has been just that, a presence, available and ready as much as he can be.

He backed up Kurt Hinish ably in 2021, but now with Hinish gone …

2019: 11 games; 14 tackles with 1.5 for loss including half a sack.

2020: 11 games; 4 tackles with one for loss and one pass broken up.

2021: 11 games with 12 tackles including two for loss.

Notre Dame’s study abroad options are among the best in the country, and the University’s ability to make some of that available even to football players is impressive. That does not need to be supplemented with a sponsorship deal, but a good travel agency could see some reward on investment in one, no?

QUOTES

Lacey’s setbacks in 2020 may be a distant memory by now, but they hold some value to reflect upon, both for Lacey and from the outside. A lack of progress as a sophomore, after an impressive debut campaign, bode poorly in the moment, but given the circumstances behind that temporary plateau, those worries lose traction.

In an unexpected way, the time spent worn out and beaten up gave Lacey an opportunity to improve.

“I would be lying if I said I wasn’t very frustrated going through that year, battling through that injury,” Lacey said in November. “I’m glad I didn’t just stop playing. I’ve definitely grown a tremendous amount from that. It allowed me to drop weight and focus on gaining muscle, things I needed to do from the beginning, just really rehabbing, focused on things I should have done before coming to college.

“I’m very happy to be healthy now. … Every opportunity I get on the field, whether it’s four plays or 20 plays, I know I can make a play that can help the defense.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“It starts with health, more so than every other case in football. Shoulder injuries have replaced most knee injuries as the trickiest to repair and come back from. Rushing Lacey back from his would only serve to further hamper his career.

“But once healthy and strong enough to keep that shoulder healthy, Lacey will be a vital piece of Notre Dame’s interior defensive line rotation. Working through Hinish, Cross and Lacey will allow the first two to preserve their legs for the season’s grueling October stretch.

“It will also allow Lacey a chance to prove himself once again. His 2019 was promising, but that optimism has been mitigated by these shoulder concerns. To become someone the Irish will lean on in years to come, Lacey needs to prove once again he can put together a full season. …

“Presuming that health and season-long contribution, Lacey and Cross should then form a pertinent (and quite possibly potent) duo in 2022 and presumably 2023. Whereas Cross (and Hinish) displays an intuitive sense of penetration from the nose tackle position, and thus demanding blockers’ attention, Lacey is more a wide body that occupies the space and thus clogs up an offense.

“Neither skill set is inherently better than the other. Rather, that change of pace can further frustrate an offense, having to adapt its blocking scheme as Notre Dame gladly rotates defensive linemen.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

The praise will come to Lacey belatedly. Playing behind Hinish, an ironman himself, for years kept Lacey from much notice. When Hinish did not play against Wisconsin last year due to a concussion, Lacey filled the role against the rushing attack. The Badgers gaining 81 yards on 27 carries (sacks adjusted) was not a coincidence, even if Lacey finished with only two tackles.

Those two tackles may have shown all they needed to. Lacey stuffed a Wisconsin rush for no gain on a fourth-and-one, and then he dropped the ball carrier behind the line of scrimmage on a first-and-goal from the 10-yard line.

Of Hinish’s many qualities, he was never that kind of run-stopping force in the middle. Frankly, Lacey wasn’t always, either, when his shoulder continued to plague him. But now he is, to such an extent that he is keeping talents like senior Howard Cross out of the starting lineup, and Cross has no choice but to recognize why.

“Jacob is a brick wall,” Cross said. You can’t move him, at all. Crazy fast off the ball, crazy fast with his hands, I mean, every time we watch film, no matter what, even if he takes a wrong step, they’re still not moving him. He’s extremely good at what he does.”

That is all while Lacey weighs significantly less. Last season, Notre Dame listed Lacey at 293 pounds, though he says 300 would have been more accurate. Now, he is at 275, perhaps 280.

Lacey has never lacked for strength. Now he enjoys health and quickness, too, along with opportunity. That latter aspect should yield great results for the Irish defense. Those results coming from Lacey may not be widely anticipated, but the source will reveal itself in retrospect.

DOWN THE ROAD

Lacey has already graduated. If he falls behind Cross or Rubio this season, a transfer will be a welcome chance for his final season of eligibility.

But more likely, Lacey starts for the Irish for two full seasons after serving as Hinish’s understudy for three. Gradual defensive line developments can produce memorable players just as much as immediate stars can.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Fisher has four seasons of eligibility remaining. Not all that long ago, his appearance in the Fiesta Bowl would have cost Fisher a year of eligibility, but the uniform four-game eligibility exception removed that gray area from injury concerns to everyone’s benefit.

Depth Chart: Fisher will start for Notre Dame at right tackle, a year after beginning the season at left tackle before an injury — and then two more injuries to others — gave classmate Joe Alt a chance to star.

Recruiting: An All-American and rivals.com five-star, Fisher ranked as the No. 1 prospect in Indiana, the No. 6 offensive tackle in the class and No. 25 overall prospect in the country. Thus, expectedly, he held a scholarship offer from every pertinent program.

CAREER TO DATE

Fisher was the second freshman to ever start on Notre Dame’s offensive line in the season opener when he took the field at left tackle at Florida State last year, then a slight meniscus tear ended that role in less than a half. Initially, then-Irish head coach Brian Kelly suggested Fisher could return at some point midseason, but Kelly was notoriously optimistic when discussing injury timelines with the media.

Instead, Fisher improved enough to practice in the lead-up to the Fiesta Bowl, and when starting right tackle Josh Lugg needed surgery, Fisher was quickly deemed his replacement in the bowl game. He held up for 70 dropbacks, facing the best pass rush in the country. With freshmen book ends on the offensive line, Notre Dame gave up just two sacks on those 70 pass plays.

QUOTES

Sometimes a November quote does not get used in weekly game coverage because it is not entirely pertinent in that particular moment. When linebacker Drew White commented on Fisher and Alt as the Irish readied to face Virginia last November, the focus was on the Cavaliers’ potent offense and the questionable availability of their star quarterback Brennan Armstrong, so White’s thoughts on the pair of young offensive tackles were never relayed to the masses.

“They’re pretty mature for how young they are,” White said. “They’re also ginormous, so that helps, as well. Those are some really tall and big dudes.”

The lack of a red squiggly line under ginormous is how we learned that is actually a word and not merely an amalgamation of giant and enormous.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Despite all the springtime praise, it should not be presumed Fisher starts in Tallahassee. If he does so, he will be the first Notre Dame freshman starter on the offensive line in the season opener since Sam Young in 2006. And Baker is a quality player himself.

“But all that springtime praise makes it seem likely Fisher will start, quite possibly alongside (Rocco) Spindler. At that point, all bets are off.

“Many will see a pair of 18-year-olds starting on the offensive line and punt on the Irish season. That would be rash. Both Fisher and Spindler played at a collegiate level this spring, somehow.

“There will undoubtedly be hiccups, just as there would be with Baker getting his first true action, but if Fisher can find some footing in September and maintain through the grueling stretch that awaits the Irish in October, he could put together a November impressive enough to garner even more hype entering 2022. …

“It feels distinctly rash to look at a player that has not seen a single collegiate snap and ponder him jumping to the NFL after his junior season, but given that the Irish have produced only first- and second-round draft picks from left tackle during the entire Brian Kelly era, the thought of Fisher starting as a true freshman plays right into him heading to the draft after the 2023 season. (To again acknowledge one’s own error, suggesting 2023 would be when Fisher might first start was conservative to a fault.)

“To risk pulling this into a bigger and broader conversation than any “99-to-0″ entry warrants, at some point the years remaining in Kelly’s tenure need to be considered. This past spring, Aaron Banks became the first offensive lineman in Kelly’s 11 years to spurn one more season for the NFL draft when a first-round possibility was not assured. Banks going in the second round proved the logic to his decision, but the intended point is that Kelly and his staff have made a habit of talking elite offensive linemen back into one final season. Ronnie Stanley and Mike McGlinchey top the list of those who benefited from such persuasion, but the list covers Kelly’s 11 years.

Come 2023, though, Kelly will have been at Notre Dame for 14 seasons. If he is retiring then — not a prediction, just an acknowledgment that with every season passed, the odds of Kelly stepping away increase — that sales pitch may not land with the same effectiveness. Fisher could head to the NFL after only three seasons, not that anyone could blame him.”

2022 OUTLOOK

The hype around Fisher was surprisingly muted this spring. Few Notre Dame practices were open to the media, Fisher never met with the media, and much of the offensive line content bandwidth went toward Harry Hiestand’s return as offensive line coach.

That hype will come this August. All the reasons Fisher earned the starting left tackle gig as a freshman are still applicable, but now he should be a bit stronger and with better fundamentals thanks to Hiestand.

“You can see there’s a very talented player there and someone that’s learning on the job and learning how to be the best player he can be,” Hiestand said of Fisher this spring. “Normally, those conversations are about fundamentals or things we saw in practice we’re trying to emphasize. We’re trying to get our technique to be tremendously consistent.”

Fisher’s technique was never sloppy, but it can yet become an asset.

Four members of the starting Irish offensive line are clear in Fisher, Alt, sixth-year right guard Josh Lugg and fifth-year interior lineman Jarrett Patterson. They average 313 pounds and 6-foot-6 ¼. Notre Dame’s offensive line is going to garner notice once it is solidified in August.

When that happens, Fisher will once again draw attention. Once the season starts, the combination of him and Lugg should give the Irish a vintage power side — anecdotally, that is usually on the left side, so that flip alone will spur a few stories. Fisher has proven himself adept in blitz pickup, but at this point in his career, his best skill is power in run blocking, and that will be featured a bit more on the right side.

That may sound odd, but it comes down to the wide side of the field vs. the narrow side of the field. With a right-handed starting quarterback, more plays will start on the left hash mark so he can more comfortably buy time rolling to the right,, making the right side of the field the wide side. Any offense is more likely to run around tackle on the side of the field with more room to operate.

Fisher will set an edge there, likely picking up some linebackers as he does so. Frankly, purely from a “good football is fun” perspective, those run plays could become some of the most enjoyable highlights of the Irish season.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A senior, Correll has three seasons of eligibility remaining, only the 2021 season counting against his clock thus far.

Depth Chart: Correll will either be Notre Dame’s starting center or backup left guard. That much appears clear, though that binary uncertainty is obviously unclear in its own way.

Recruiting: A consensus four-star prospect, Correll was rated the No. 6 guard in the country, per rivals.com, fitting with where he spent his high school career. The Under Armour All-American narrowed his decision to Notre Dame, Clemson, Ohio State and Stanford.

CAREER TO DATE

Correll spent his freshman season trying to add weight, a consistent need of his last three years, appearing in only four uncompetitive moments. By 2020, he had worked his way into being Jarrett Patterson’s backup at center, which mattered when Patterson suffered a foot injury in November.

Correll took over … for a week. A mild ankle injury then gave the Irish coaching staff reason to ponder Josh Lugg’s ability at center. Lugg did not excel at the pivot, meaning Correll stepped back into the starting role in the College Football Playoff loss against Alabama.

Correll showed enough in his two starts to be considered a priority starter heading into 2021, moving to left guard to accommodate Patterson at center. He started there for six games before classmate Andrew Kristofic replaced him, Notre Dame seeking more size to help an uneven line. The combination of Kristofic and then-freshman Joe Alt at left tackle buoyed the Irish, though one could fairly wonder if their success was mostly about the quality of opponents on the second half of the 2021 schedule.

QUOTES

Correll understands the expected talking point that he does not have a preference where he plays, be it center or left guard. Of course, he privately does, but the senior knows better than to voice that.

Nonetheless, he would prefer Notre Dame decide on his role early in preseason practices.

“Wherever you get more reps at is where you’re going to be more comfortable currently,” Correll said in early April as he worked at center all spring with Patterson sidelined by a torn pectoral. “I’ve been working at center (in spring practices), so I feel comfortable at center right now, but I can play either.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“To say someone has never been faulted is facetious and lazy, but the faults have not yet been found with Correll. He spent more than 18 months diligently adding 20-25 pounds, in the appropriate manner, to be ready for the collegiate game. Even before that process was complete, he was a scout-team headache for the starting Irish defense.

“Continuing such a trend line would bode very well for Notre Dame. The very real possibility of starting two freshmen and a junior with four seasons of eligibility remaining suggests the Irish offensive line could be a force in 2022 and 2023.

“That would be the end of the expected road for Correll, but he could return in 2024, technically speaking. A dominant offensive line, however, would increase his professional possibilities. (Rocco) Spindler’s and (Blake) Fisher’s success will stem from a steady fulcrum and thus boost that fulcrum.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Another piece of Correll’s “99-to-0” entry from a year ago warrants mention now. To describe his depth-chart standing, “Irish head coach Brian Kelly spent all of one weekend casting doubt on Correll’s starting status this spring. Exactly one week later, Kelly acknowledged Correll would once again be Notre Dame’s starting center.”

The more things change, perhaps the more they stay the same.

Spring and summer rumors of Correll’s need at center are nothing new at Notre Dame. A year ago, the transfer of right guard Cain Madden from Marshall changed the equation, allowing Patterson to return to his best position. This season, something less tangible could again alter the decision-making process.

Perhaps Kristofic returns in August closer to his November form than his supposed lackluster spring look. Perhaps Patterson quietly expresses a desire to remain at center, where he is widely projected as the No. 1 draft-eligible player and possible All-American. Perhaps all of this is merely fodder to fill idle time.

That said, moving Correll back to the second-string would hardly mean a lost 2022 for him. An injury to Kristofic or Patterson would move Correll into the starting lineup, and from a pure likelihood standpoint, that is probably nearly as likely as not.

Correll’s greatest struggle in his early years at Notre Dame was adding and keeping on weight. He appears to have pulled that off, now consistently at 295 pounds. He is a viable starting center, and he may be a very good one. …

RELATED READING: Notre Dame’s man in the middle — for now — focused exactly on that

DOWN THE ROAD

… But he may have to wait until 2023 to prove that.

Patterson’s best position is center. Moving him from there could be construed as a disservice to the player, though a two-time captain would take that adjustment in stride.

Correll’s best position is also center. When he does start there, he will almost assuredly impress. It may take a full season of highlights to garner any NFL draft considerations, but do not rule out that possibility, either. This is a highly-touted recruit who has forced his way into the starting conversation for three seasons now at Notre Dame. That version of persistence bodes well, as it speaks to what coaches see in Correll no matter who is ahead of him on the depth chart.

2022-23 year, eligibility: Bauer returns with only one season of eligibility remaining, a gift of the universal pandemic eligibility waiver as Bauer has already played in four complete seasons.

Depth Chart: Either Bauer or senior JD Bertrand should start as Notre Dame’s Mike (middle) linebacker in 2022. No competition between the two really took hold in the spring as Bertrand was limited with a wrist injury and, frankly, they may share the position more than anything else.

Recruiting: A four-star prospect and the No. 5 inside linebacker in the class of 2018, per rivals.com, Bauer chose the Irish over offers from Michigan State, Penn State and Vanderbilt. The No. 158 overall recruit in the class, Bauer may have suppressed possible offers by committing to Notre Dame 18 months ahead of his expected signing.

CAREER TO DATE

As Bauer chases the Irish record for career appearances this season, he can thank his early special teams successes. He made 10 tackles in 12 games as a freshman, excelling in special teams moments. His celebrations sometimes got him in some hot water, but he kept chasing down returners on coverage units all the same, being named the special teams MVP in 2019.

He played only 91 defensive snaps that season, making it clear his first 26 games were largely the result of special teams work.

Then in 2020, Bauer found a niche role on third downs. He may not be the prototypical passing-down specialist — quick, but not necessarily the most agile; and a tendency to overcommit in pursuit, part of what made him good on special teams in the first place — but the “nickel-Buck” concept worked well.

In 2021, Bauer continued that role but also played more broadly as Notre Dame ran out of healthy linebackers.

2018: 13 games; 10 tackles.

2019: 13 games; 28 tackles with two for loss.

2020: 12 games; 26 tackles with 4.5 for loss including one sack, one interception and two passes broken up.

2021: 13 games with one start; 47 tackles with four for loss including 1.5 sacks, one interception and six passes broken up.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

If Bauer reaches November still playing every week, someone should get Cal Ripken Jr. on the phone if for no other reason than a token sponsorship deal. Bauer could reach 64 games played at Notre Dame, not to mention 64 straight games played, shattering Kurt Hinish’s seemingly unbreakable record of 61 games played.

Now, knock on wood a few dozen times.

Playing 64 straight games of football at any level is something worth applauding.

QUOTES

If there ever has been a season in which Bauer has inherit advantages to get through it healthy, it will be this one. Former Irish linebacker Drue Tranquill may have been the first player to clearly take advantage of the reduced academic workload as a fifth-year veteran in 2018 and turn that into more recovery time. He, of course, needed it on both fronts. The engineering major was not used to anything but a heavy class load, and after he suffered two serious knee injuries, he needed all the time in the proverbial ice tub that he could get.

Since then, that emphasis has become more common for Notre Dame seniors and graduates.

“My focus is on just becoming a pro,” Bauer said in January. “Graduated from college, so academics first, football second kind of now flips, so I’m really focused on becoming overall a better athlete. Sleep, nutrition, strength, kind of focus very intentional. Get into film a little bit extra, learn the game a little bit more.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“The challenge for Freeman, more than for Bauer but also for Bauer, becomes getting both Bauer and (Drew) White onto the field at the same time. Linebacker was not a position of concern in 2020 for the Irish, even aside from Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, but is also not a position of overwhelming confidence at the moment.

“That both creates an opportunity for Bauer to force a shake-up and a lack of a need to do so.

“Notre Dame does not yet know who will be its primary weakside linebacker; first it must figure out its primary rover. At first blush, neither would be Bauer. But he showed enough in 2020 to make that a possibility.

“Bauer is fast enough to stick with most tight ends and running backs in coverage, while also aggressive enough to serve as an effective blitzer. Hence his third-down applicability last season. Continuing primarily in that role would give Bauer plenty of chances to impact in 2021. Third downs are, after all, obviously important.

“And in ‘just’ that role, Bauer would still have plenty of energy to make Irish special teams coordinator Brian Polian’s life easier. …

“Bauer may end up the rare player that actually capitalizes on the universal pandemic eligibility waiver. After a third year as the starter in 2021, White’s college time may be up (though he would still technically have one season of eligibility remaining). At that point, despite the influx in linebacker recruiting in the last cycle, Bauer should be White’s heir apparent.

“In normal times, Bauer would not have that additional season of eligibility, but these are not normal times, particularly in how the NCAA is handling eligibility. Notre Dame may flinch at utilizing many years of pandemic exceptions, but a starting middle linebacker with Bauer’s experience and talent would be the type of case Freeman and Irish head coach Brian Kelly would have to consider.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Stay healthy and break that record. Bask in it a bit, even.

Beyond that, it is hard to quite grasp if Bertrand or Bauer will start in the middle. Bertrand had the better 2021, but Bauer is more durable and may have the more applicable skill set. Notre Dame has enough talented linebackers to field a genuine two-deep at this point, but it is still light on experience, so moving Bertrand around a bit could help mollify that early-season concern.

Either way, Bauer should continue to be a disruption in the passing game. That is the unexpected wrinkle he brings as a middle linebacker. The Irish expect their Rover to play in coverage and/or blitz effectively. The Will (weakside) linebacker absolutely works against tight ends and running backs. None of that is as inherent in the middle linebacker’s job description.

Bauer being so effective at it, though, will allow new defensive coordinator Al Golden flexibility. He can rotate packages without giving up much to an opposing offense. He can disguise blitzes and coverages. He can adjust on the fly, something Golden insists will be a newfound ability for Notre Dame as he applies some NFL mentality to the college level.

If Bauer matches last year’s numbers of 47 tackles and six passes broken up, consider that a solid baseline. More could be within reach, pending the linebacker rotation.

And if nothing else, maybe one or two more special teams highlights for old time’s sake …

DOWN THE ROAD

This is it for Bauer at this level.

He could have transferred this season and started most anywhere else. Not doing so likely underscores his NFL ambitions. If he cannot start at Notre Dame, what are the odds he would catch on in the NFL, anyway?

At the absolute least, Bauer should get some training camp invites. A strong season could put him in the mix to be a late-round draft pick, but the NFL does not often leap at the idea of fifth-year veterans who started only one season.

The ability to easily comprehend their possible time remaining is a perk to discussing freshmen and sophomores, all of whom came to college after the universal pandemic eligibility waiver.

Depth Chart: On paper, Spindler may be the backup left guard behind senior Andrew Kristofic, but some springtime uncertainty about Kristofic’s play never led to earnest conversations about Spindler as a possibility. So in reality, Spindler is likely behind senior Zeke Correll and perhaps also fifth-year Jarrett Patterson. One of those two could end up at center with the other at left guard, if Kristofic does not regain control of his starting role, continuing to leave Spindler as the odd man out.

Recruiting: The Under Armour All-American and consensus four-star prospect sure seemed to be focused on his homestate powerhouse, visiting Michigan six times during his recruitment, or perhaps Ohio State (three times), before he chose Notre Dame. Rivals.com ranked Spindler the No. 4 guard in the class and No. 67 overall recruit in the 2021 cycle.

“Those questions will change in a year, when (Cain) Madden is out of eligibility and (Josh) Lugg presumably turns down his pandemic-possible added season. At that point, Spindler will start.

“Notre Dame’s coaching staff is clearly high on the Michigan native. (Brian) Kelly once again throwing the center position into doubt in June may have been as much about getting Spindler onto the field as it was about challenging Correll.

“Spindler will start for at least two seasons in South Bend. If fewer than that, it is only because he plays so well, but if that is the case, then playing time in 2021 and thus three years already feels like the minimum.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Cain Madden’s transfer from Marshall curtailed the rampant praise of Spindler from 2021’s spring. With Madden joining the Irish, the open starting guard positions fell by half, and Notre Dame had enough veterans with untapped possibilities to no longer rely on the early-enrolled freshman.

From afar, that came across as Spindler losing ground in his development, but that was unfair; a preseason bout of COVID set Spindler back a few steps. Furthermore, only two freshmen have ever started the season opener on the Irish offensive line. Spindler so often being mentioned in the same breath as classmate Blake Fisher, one of those two, set undue expectations.

Carry those no further, not even into 2022.

Both Kristofic and Correll started at left guard ahead of Spindler last season. There is every reason to believe they both would this year, as well. The top-five linemen may yet be in flux, but Spindler is not even No. 6 or 7.

This will be a fall spent working with returned offensive line coach Harry Hiestand on fundamentals while knowing all along a rash of injuries would change the weekly stress for Spindler. He is not entirely removed from the playing conversation, but he is not a piece of the immediate equation, either.

DOWN THE ROAD

Spindler will end up in the starting lineup. Those rave reviews last spring were early evidence his high recruiting rankings were valid. After 2022, Notre Dame will need to replace at least two starters in Patterson and sixth-year right guard Josh Lugg.

For the sake of this conversation, presume Kristofic returns for a fifth season. At that point, Correll will be the likely starter at center, and only Kristofic will otherwise be on the roster with notable experience at guard.

Kristofic, Spindler and early-enrolled freshman Billy Schrauth would be the front-runners to emerge as the two starting guards. And, again, that is assuming Kristofic comes back in 2023. That is no certainty.

Spindler should start in 2023. If there had been a touch less hype around him in 2021’s spring, being in pole position to start as a junior would be considered a wild success for any offensive lineman. It will set up Spindler to be a likely two-year starter, though the Irish would probably welcome a third season in 2025, even if that does seem a bit far off currently.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Schweitzer has all four seasons of eligibility remaining after appearing in only three games as a freshman, all in November. Such usage of underclassmen was one of the ideal perks to the four-game eligibility exception created not all that long ago.

Depth Chart: Schweitzer moved to Rover this spring, from Vyper end, an understandable position switch given he still weighs only 225 pounds. He will have time to learn his new role, with senior Jack Kiser and junior Jordan Botelho looking like the primary one-two punch at the position while early-enrolled freshman Jaylen Sneed looks to be the Rover of the future, taking some further pressure off Schweitzer’s immediate development.

Recruiting: A consensus three-star and the No. 29 defensive end in the class, per rivals.com, the California native chose the Irish over most of the Pac 12, as well as Virginia Tech, Michigan State and Arkansas. Of all those Power Five offers, Schweitzer originally committed to Nebraska.

CAREER TO DATE

Schweitzer played in three November blowouts, notching a tackle during Notre Dame’s 55-0 rout of Georgia Tech in the home finale.

QUOTES

It is worth pulling this entire section from last summer’s post, both because Schweitzer has since moved back to linebacker, his high school position and because remembering the oddities of recruiting during the pandemic will help inform future roster moves:

Schweitzer’s recruitment may end up as the best case study of pandemic prospecting …

“Schweitzer is actually the last prospect I saw in person,” then-recruiting coordinator Brian Polian said in December of 2020. “I was in Schwetizer’s school in January (of 2020) before the cycle ended and we haven’t been back out since. [Former Notre Dame defensive coordinator] Clark Lea and I loved him.

“The issue when he was a junior was that he was playing linebacker. He was 205 or 208 pounds. Why are you recruiting this guy to play the Vyper position when he’s standing up? You don’t see him pass rush that much, but his motor was so good and we knew because we had seen him, he’s got length, he is 6-foot-4-plus.”

All that is why the Cornhuskers were so interested in the first place, holding a Schweitzer commitment through two months of summer, the peak of pandemic uncertainty in college football. Throughout that time, the Irish could not see Schweitzer, not because of the Nebraska pledge but because of the recruiting dead period induced by the pandemic. That slowed Notre Dame’s transition from viewing Schweitzer as a linebacker to viewing him as a possible defensive end.

“Through the summer, even though he was committed to Nebraska, we never stopped communicating with him and we were watching his body,” Polian said. “He’d send us photos and video and you’re seeing his body start to fill out.

“When the time was right and the numbers allowed it, we offered him and we felt great about it.”

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Give him a call, Visit South Bend.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“The next line in Polian’s comments on Schweitzer summed up what should be expected in 2021 …

“‘He is a guy that is gonna take some physical development, but his length, his twitch, his motor, we believe are going to lend himself to being a really good player.’

“This will be a year of development for Schweitzer, at least some of it spent on the scout team. Even those reps will be valuable to Schweitzer given he did not have a senior season of football and his spring practice was halted by an injury akin to a patella issue, per head coach Brian Kelly.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

The instinct is to write off Schweitzer’s season. He hardly saw the field as a freshman, partly done in by that springtime knee injury. He switched positions this spring, now at one headlined by a play-making veteran and a dynamic junior. Expecting contributions from the California native in 2022 first means expecting total health, a steep learning curve at a new position and overall development.

That may be a lot to ask. Yet …

Injuries have a way of drastically dampening expectations, often unnecessarily so.

Schweitzer made four tackles in the 2022 Blue-Gold Game, displaying health. He has a full summer to grasp his new position, not to mention the Rover linebacker and the Vyper end have some overlap in duties to start with. And junior Jordan Botelho has not exactly been the most consistent of players thus far in his career.

It is not beyond the realm of comprehension to think Schweitzer could end up with a dozen tackles this season. That may not seem like a lot, but for context, Botelho had 18 tackles last season, surprising safeties Xavier Watts and Ramon Henderson had 15 and 14, respectively, and backup defensive tackle Jacob Lacey had 12.

It may yet be unlikely Schweitzer finds such a contributing role, but it is more likely than a complete loss of a season. His freshman season going awry is not reason enough to assume such will continue.

DOWN THE ROAD

The difficulty for Schweitzer may be predicting future advancement up the depth chart. Kiser has three seasons of eligibility remaining, courtesy of the universal pandemic eligibility waiver. Botelho has three, as well.

Kiser hanging around South Bend into the 2024 season is obviously doubtful, but a fifth-year is probable. That duo would keep Schweitzer on the third-string at his new position through at least next season.

Then again, a three-star recruit waiting until his senior season to see regular playing time is nothing to be surprised by. That is, in fact, essentially what a three-star rating means.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Onye has all four seasons of eligibility remaining after not appearing in a game in 2021.

Depth Chart: Onye will provide depth somewhere on Notre Dame’s defensive interior, either the third option at three-technique tackle behind fifth-year Jayson Ademilola and senior Howard Cross or the fourth-stringer at nose tackle behind senior Jacob Lacey, Harvard transfer Chris Smith and sophomore Gabriel Rubio.

Recruiting: Recruits from Rhode Island rarely draw much attention, especially ones who barely played in high school, but the consensus three-star and No. 43 defensive end in the class, per rivals.com, still earned offers from Michigan, Penn State and Virginia Tech, among others.

In fact, to drive home that point in anecdotal fashion, rivals.com does not even tally a ranking of Rhode Island recruits each cycle, because so few draw interest.

CAREER TO DATE

Onye did not take the field on a Saturday in the fall of 2021.

QUOTES

Onye moved to the interior from “Big” end at some point in the last year, the timing somewhat vague simply because he was hardly a topic of conversation at any point in the last 12 months. That said, it was not an entirely unexpected move, given then-defensive line coach Mike Elston’s comments when Onye joined the Irish.

“Jason is going to be a Big end for us,” Elston said in February of 2021. “Right now he’s 275-280 pounds. He’s going to be a huge end, as we call it right now. He gives us some good position flexibility.

“Maybe he goes in and plays some three-technique.”

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Every player on Notre Dame’s roster already owns a suit, a uniformity that hints at team issuance. It is only a matter of time before some clothing sponsor signs the entire roster to an NIL deal that allows it to trumpet a claim to those fits.

“Onye will take some to develop, an assumption supported by a number of facts. The first of those is a Notre Dame luxury: The Irish have plenty of defensive line talent, experience and depth.

“The rest apply to Onye more specifically. Rhode Island is not known for its football talent. That is less a knock on Onye and more an acknowledgment that he will need to adjust to the collegiate talent level even more than most freshmen.

“Furthermore, Onye injured his foot during his senior basketball season, which then cost him Rhode Island’s spring football season. He has not played a competitive snap in nearly two full years, and even then, Onye was raw, playing only one full season of high school football.

“He already has the size needed to compete at the next level, but development as a whole awaits Onye, development that will be his focus in 2021. It may be such an emphasis that he does not even appear in a blowout of Toledo. …

“Onye’s career will be curious to watch unfold. Wherever he currently is between 245 and 280, he is already big. If he adds much weight, he will inevitably move inside to three-technique. If, however, he can maintain length as his primary attribute, then a long-term development could be in store.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Depth matters at defensive line. Onye growing into his weight gain — recruiting services listed him at only 245 when he signed with Notre Dame in December of 2020 — should give the Irish a touch more depth than it needs, a luxury new defensive line coach Al Washington will jump at.

Consider three-technique tackle. Ademilola is on the verge of stardom, and that may be the only thing that keeps Cross from 40 tackles himself. Onye has no chance of cracking that two-deep, barring injury.

But in a blowout of Marsall or, actually even more likely, Cal in September, Washington would relish the chance to spare Ademilola and Cross fourth-quarter snaps. Giving Onye that experience would serve both the purpose of keeping the veterans’ legs fresher and of giving him a chance to prove himself at his new, albeit always somewhat presumed, position.

DOWN THE ROAD

Onye is raw. He simply has not played enough football. The second-generation Nigerian immigrant lost a crucial season of development to the pandemic, and then he did not play any competitive snaps in 2021, either.

Give him time.

His size and length makes Onye an ideal defensive line prospect. With Ademilola onto the NFL after this season, Cross should start at three-technique tackle next year. Onye will compete with early-enrolled freshman Tyson Ford to serve as Cross’ primary backup, though both should see added playing time.

Notre Dame expected a longer timeline when it signed Onye. Neither the length of the timeline nor the eventually expected payoff has changed.

2022-23 year, eligibility: An early-enrolled freshman, Tuihalamaka has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: A year ago, Notre Dame flailed for linebacker depth. Now, it should have enough to keep the heralded freshman recruiting class off the two-deep, with fifth-year Bo Bauer and senior JD Bertrand both likely ahead of Tuihalamaka at middle (Mike) linebacker.

Recruiting: Tuihalamaka committed to USC before the pandemic curtailed all recruiting, and that pledge held up for nearly a year. Then the Irish offered the southern California product a scholarship, and he quickly re-opened his recruitment, but Tuihalamaka did not commit to Notre Dame for months afterward, waiting until he could at least visit South Bend.

Once that occurred in June of 2021, shortly after the pandemic-induced recruiting dead period ended, Tuihalamaka committed to the Irish over Texas, Stanford and Arizona State, while also holding offers from more than half the Pac 12, LSU and Penn State.

The No. 8 inside linebacker in the class and No. 206 overall prospect, per rivals.com, he was the third linebacker to join Marcus Freeman’s recruiting class in Freeman’s sole cycle as Notre Dame’s defensive coordinator and linebackers coach.

QUOTES

It is a testament both to Tuihalamaka’s southern California roots and his broad talent that he was an example cited by Freeman when discussing the types of players the Irish need to pursue more aggressively.

“I don’t know if (linebacker) Jaylen Sneed and some of those guys were just dying to come to Notre Dame until you could explain to them, ‘Hey, here’s really what Notre Dame can do for you,’” Freeman said in December. “‘Hey Junior (Tuihalamaka), here’s the things that Notre Dame can do for you that will change the rest of your life.’

“So, to me, that’s the ability to just try to get into their head. ‘How can I communicate this so they can see what makes Notre Dame different?’”

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Someone needs to replace Troy Polamalu in those Head & Shoulders commercials, right?

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN TUIHALAMAKA SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“Tuihalamaka has had a college-ready frame since he was a sophomore in high school, yet he also has the athleticism to handle some work in coverage. …

“With current freshman Kahuna Kia still expected to take a two-year mission, a hole will open in the depth chart behind Bertrand. Tuihalamaka’s body will be ready for that responsibility sooner than most underclassmen.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Tuihalamaka’s early enrollment paid more dividends than it does for most, allowing him to take a bounty of second-string snaps at middle linebacker behind Bauer while Bertrand recovered from a wrist injury. And Tuihalamaka impressed in those opportunities.

Just not enough to suggest he will leapfrog either of the veterans.

Instead, Tuihalamaka Will Likely find a situational role on defense, lessening Bauer’s and Bertrand’s workload while also allowing him to focus on one niche skill. It could be blitzing or perhaps dropping into coverage on a running back. Former Irish linebacker Shayne Simon first shined in a goal-line package alone. Whatever it is, Tuihalamaka made it clear this spring, he has the physicality and speed to handle it.

Along with that, expect Tuihalamaka to cover just about every single Notre Dame kickoff this season. That alone could net him 8-10 tackles.

DOWN THE ROAD

Bauer’s record-setting career will conclude in 2022, leaving Tuihalamaka to insure Bertrand does not get worn down by a bevy of snaps. And then Bertrand’s career should wrap up in 2023.

Tuihalamaka’s path to playing time and subsequently a starting role is that clear. This spring made it apparent he is not about to be physically overwhelmed, quite a statement from a player that should have been worrying about his high school civics final.

Depth Chart: Peitsch will back up fifth-year former walk-on Michael “Milk” Vinson as Notre Dame’s long snapper.

Recruiting: Widely considered the No. 1 or No. 2 long snapper in the class of 2020, the Under Armour All-American committed to Notre Dame eight full months before signing.

CAREER TO DATE

Peitsch played in the 52-0 blowout of South Florida in 2020 — a pertinent moment as the season progressed and multiple teams across the country, like the Bulls that Saturday, were undone by substitute long snappers when health and safety protocols sidelined their starters — but did not appear in a game in 2021.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“While Vinson should remain the starter, Peitsch may see more mop-up duty this season. Even in a year with some roster uncertainty, the Irish should blow out the likes of Toledo, Navy and Stanford, at which point every backup should get work, even if doing so jeopardizes a kicker’s percentages or net yardages.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Vinson approached Marcus Freeman in December about returning for a fifth season, expecting it to be as a walk-on, somewhat tentative Freeman would suggest it was time to move on and for the Irish to turn the page to Peitsch at long snapper. Instead, Freeman expressed some level of relief that a steady on-field presence and steadier locker-room voice would return and rewarded Vinson with a scholarship.

Thus ended Peitsch’s hopes of starting in 2022. Vinson has never displayed any erraticism, so it is hard to even fathom a situation where Chuck Knoblauch needs to be benched, so to speak.

DOWN THE ROAD

2022 will be Vinson’s last at Notre Dame, at which point Peitsch will finally get his chance. The Irish did not expect a scholarship long snapper to need to wait this long to play consistently; in fact, as Peitsch arrived in South Bend just as John Shannon left, who did so just as Scott Daly left, the plan was for Peitsch to play right away.

Him not doing so has been a luxury created by Vinson’s skill and consistency.

One player’s success does not foreshadow another’s struggles. There is no evidence Peitsch will struggle once the role is his in 2023, and it should be his for at least two seasons, with a third possible but unlikely given it would take a sixth year, and at some point he will presumably want to tackle the next stage in his life, a la Shannon skipping his final season of eligibility.

2022-23 year, eligibility: An incoming freshman, Hinish has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Slot Hinish in on the scout team as the nose tackle in 2022. With senior Jacob Lacey, Harvard graduate transfer Chris Smith and sophomore Gabriel Rubio ahead of him, Notre Dame would have to suffer at least one long-term injury for Hinish to move into a contributing role this season.

Recruiting: Some brothers try not to follow their elder siblings’ footsteps. For others, it is only too natural. The consensus three-star prospect and No. 44 defensive tackle in the class, per rivals.com, always seemed likely to head to South Bend after his older brother Kurt had such success, though the expected gap between the two was anticipated to be a season, not mere months thanks to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver keeping Kurt around for a record-setting fifth season.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Hopefully Serena Williams, Jim Harbaugh and Jeff Bridges launch some bragging rights enterprise to forever remind older siblings that the youngers often find more success.

QUOTES

If anyone would predict greater success for Donovan at Notre Dame than Kurt enjoyed — that is one-time captain, five-year contributor, 61 games played, 20 tackles for loss — it would be Kurt. It may be a bit before anyone offers a better scouting report of Donovan than his older brother did more than a year ago.

“All the coaches out there are always joking around with me and talking about stuff that he’s better at than I am,” Kurt said in April of 2021. “So we’re about the same size, if not, he might be an inch or two taller than I am, give or take. He’s about 275 (pounds) right now. My dad has him in the gym working out, putting some weight on him, he looks real good.

“The one thing my younger brother does a lot better than I do, just naturally he’s a lot more athletic than I am, laterally. He’s a better all-around athlete than me. I kind of got the $%#@ end of the stick. It is what it is. The youngest get it all.”

The youngest get it all.

To be clear, Kurt is not the only one to suggest he is the less talented Hinish brother.

“He’s a more athletic Kurt,” former Irish defensive line coach Mike Elston said in December. “I know he’s a more athletic Kurt, and he’s probably a little bit stronger than Kurt coming out of high school. So I’m super excited for him. He’s going to be a pit bull, bull dog inside, like his brother has been, with maybe a little bit more athleticism in there.

“And I’m not afraid to say that because Kurt knows I would say that.”

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN HINISH SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“If Kurt’s scouting reporting is accurate, than much may be expected from his younger brother, recruiting ranking aside. Donovan will have to channel the same drive that pushed Kurt, but every indication is that blue-collar attitude runs throughout the entire family.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Hinish is so much like his older brother, it could be to his detriment. Just like Kurt sought second opinions to gain medical clearance during the 2021 season after some concussion concerns, Donovan played the entire season with a torn labrum. He injured his shoulder in July but did not get surgery on it until the winter.

He should be recovered from that before the 2022 season, but his weight training may have fallen behind a touch. That, again, is hard to fathom from a Hinish and thus is likely an overreaction, but that possibility is further reason to pace Donovan this season.

That is a distinct difference from Kurt’s freshman season, when an utter lack of depth on the defensive interior forced both Hinish and classmate Myron Tagovailoa-Amosa to play full seasons in 2017, the freshman duo serving as Notre Dame’s second-string tackles.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

DOWN THE ROAD

Lacey may enjoy another season in 2023, and at three-technique tackle, senior Howard Cross could conceivably play through the 2024 season at Notre Dame, though any sixth-year moments should be considered unlikely.

But beyond them, the Irish depth on the interior will shift quickly. Smith has only this season at Notre Dame. Fifth-year three-technique Jayson Ademilola will almost certainly head to the NFL following this season.

Thus, in 2023, Hinish could be in a competitive situation to be the backup at either interior position.

If he is as advertised by his older brother, Donovan Hinish forcing his way into significant playing time will be only a matter of when.

WHY NO. 51?

Editor’s Note: The original version of this story was published before Notre Dame announced Hinish would wear No. 41 this season. That version guessed at his jersey number.

Rather simply, Hinish wore No. 51 in high school and no one on the Irish roster currently demands it. There is absolutely no reason to think Hinish will change numbers moving forward, unless he wants to don his older brother’s digits of 41. It would be oddly fitting, given Kurt wore No. 51 in high school before making the switch to 41 because junior linebacker Devyn Spruell wore No. 51.

2022-23 year, eligibility: An early-enrolled freshman, Burnham has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Recruited as a linebacker, a key word to describe Burnham as a prospect was “versatile,” suggesting then he may make a position switch once in college, and indeed, Burnham moved up to Vyper end this spring, where he will have plenty of time to grow into the new role. Senior Isaiah Foskey and fifth-year Justin Ademilola will get the bulk of snaps at Vyper with senior Osita Ekwonu chipping in next.

Recruiting: The Michigan Gatorade Player of the Year and a consensus four-star prospect, Burnham chose Notre Dame over his homestate power while Wisconsin chased in vain. The No. 4 inside linebacker and No. 127 overall recruit in the class, per rivals.com, Burnham committed on his birthday, otherwise known as St. Patrick’s Day, a rather clear indication of his choice before he made it public.

QUOTES

Burnham spoke with the media, as did most of the Irish early enrollees, the first week of February, and throughout that conversation, Burnham repeatedly mentioned Notre Dame’s imminent hiring of a defensive coordinator and linebackers coach, giving credence to the thought that his move to the defensive line was not long-planned.

“I’m just trying to put some weight on, maintain some speed, see whoever they bring in for a linebacker coach and DC,” Burnham said. “We’ll find the right fit.”

That weight gain was also a common theme, giving credence to the thought that a move to the defensive line was not an entirely foreign concept to Burnham.

Mostly, though, he expressed a desire to find that fit and stick to it after playing on both sides of the ball throughout high school.

“There’s a lot of talent all over the field, so being able to give it your all just on one side, it’s going to be huge,” Burnham said.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

It may take a little bit to see a No. 40 jersey and not think of Drew White.

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN BURNHAM SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“Burnham’s speed is enough to beat a running back to the edge because that moment combines his foot speed with his play diagnosis. He is not necessarily fast enough to keep up with a receiver in coverage. Hence, his future will remain between the tackles.

2022 OUTLOOK

Realizing Burnham is new to his current position and buried on the depth chart, there will be a reflex to see him as the solution for running back depth since he starred offensively in high school. Burnham ran for 1,515 yards and 29 touchdowns in 2021 while throwing for 963 yards and 14 more touchdowns.

That was as a quarterback against over-matched opposition.

It was not as a running back bracing for top-tier defenses.

Burnham is unlikely to move to running back as a band-aid this season, even if finding some depth there will be necessary.

Rather, his 76 tackles with 12.5 for loss and two interceptions last season portend his future. But that is his future, not this season.

Burnham will have plenty of time to get that wanted weight on while Foskey and Ademilola star. Some of that time should result in special teams work. That, if anything, may be the natural progression for a two-way high school star.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

DOWN THE ROAD

Both Foskey and Ademilola should head to the NFL after this season, leaving the Vyper depth chart uncertain at best. Ekwonu has four career tackles; early-enrolled freshman Aiden Gobaira has one advantage on Burnham, more time at defensive end, but an advantage that will diminish over this upcoming season.

A contributing role should be there for the taking for Burnham, but a starting role? That may still most likely be Jordan Botelho’s.

The junior spent plenty of spring practice working at Rover, but that seems like an attempt to get the dynamic playmaker on the field, regardless of position, rather than a full-fledged position change. Rover and Vyper have a good deal in common, in fact, balancing inverse ratios of pass rush with pass coverage.

Once Foskey and Ademilola have abdicated the leading roles at Notre Dame’s hybrid end gig, a Botelho return there full-time would make an abundance of sense.

That would keep Burnham out of the starting lineup until at least 2024, but there is plenty for him to learn along the defensive line in that interim.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A senior, Ekwonu has three seasons of eligibility remaining, courtesy of a typical eligibility-preserving freshman season followed by the universal pandemic eligibility waiver glossing over his nine games in 2020.

Depth Chart: Ekwonu may have found a home at Vyper end this spring, the second consecutive year that could be said. He had spent much of his healthy time the last few years at linebacker, but Vyper end both needs some depth and serves as a hybrid-linebacker role as often as not. There, Ekwonu is behind senior Isaiah Foskey and fifth-year Justin Ademilola, though the latter will split his time between Vyper end and “Big” end.

Recruiting: Ekwonu may have disappeared into the woodwork the last few seasons — more on that below, obviously — but do not forget that rivals.com considered the consensus four-star recruit the No. 15 inside linebacker in the class of 2019. Ekwonu could have headed to Alabama, Auburn or Michigan, but instead the No. 232 overall prospect in the class committed to Notre Dame two months after a springtime official visit.

CAREER TO DATE

Careers following a typical, gradual timeline that is then stalled for a year due to injury often lead to exceedingly diminished expectations largely due to a subconscious “out of sight, out of mind” factor. There is a folly to that.

Ekwonu has yet to take a snap from scrimmage in his collegiate career, working on special teams throughout his first two seasons before an Achilles tear cost him 2021. Injuries happen; aside from the obvious physical setbacks, one of their more common results is for the broader world to forget about a player’s potential.

Anyway, Ekwonu has yet to prove himself on Saturdays or, for that matter, do anything counter to that, either.

2019: 3 games, 1 tackle.

2020: 9 games, 3 tackles, one blocked punt.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Not that the Brazilian tourism bureau should need any help …

BROTHERLY HYPE

A year younger, Ekwonu’s brother Ikem “Ickey” Ekwonu was the No. 6 overall pick in April’s NFL draft, taken by the Carolina Panthers to be their left tackle of the present and the future. The former North Carolina State star was a unanimous All-American in 2021.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Modern roster construction and turnover provide opportunities in all sorts of ways. For some, it comes in the form of a new chance at Colorado. For others, it comes after a former special teams ace transferred somewhere he might start on defense.

“Jack Lamb’s transfer westward leaves a hole on special teams coverage, and while that may seem a small role for Ekwonu to blossom in, it is a role, nonetheless.

“Lamb made 13 tackles last season. Ekwonu should come close to that number on coverage units alone.

“He may not get much work on defense — partly because of the established top duo, partly because a position switch naturally comes with a learning curve, particularly when in a new defense anyway — but any chances there should also yield some quarterback hurries.

“Ekwonu arrived at Notre Dame as a seemingly surefire recruit. Waiting this long to get a pertinent chance at playing time was not expected, but it is at least somewhat because the Irish roster has continually improved during this four-year resurgence. That is not a knock on Ekwonu so much as a testament to the last couple defensive coordinators. …

“This may come across more awkwardly than intended, but … Ekwonu has the body of someone who will contribute on a Power Five team before his time is done. There is both explosiveness and speed evident in his little film, and at some point, that will break through.

“At Notre Dame, though, that may take a moment. Foskey should at least have to consider the NFL after this season, and if so, Ekwonu’s time waiting could soon come to an end. If Foskey heads to the next level — another example of a player’s body making it clear what his ceiling is, in this case, starting on an NFL defensive line — then the Irish will have only (Jordan) Botelho as an established Vyper.

“While early-enrolled freshmen Will Schweitzer and Devin Aupiu will provide depth, Ekwonu will be the more likely No. 2 in 2022. That could, in turn, lead to a starting role in 2023.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Another day, another entry into the 99-to-0 series and another opportunity to ponder a defensive end spending time at running back into 2022. The Irish dabbled with Ekwonu as a goal-line ball carrier before his Achilles injury cost him 2021, and now that Notre Dame is desperate for running back depth, there is a temptation to ponder that possibility anew.

Maybe the Irish coaching staff does so, maybe not. Regardless, it is unlikely that is where Ekwonu’s impact is felt in 2022.

He is not as buried in the Vyper depth chart as a third-string label implies. Ademilola will not be a full-time Vyper, making Ekwonu perhaps a “2B” rather than a true “No. 3.” If granting that premise, then he should take at least 10 snaps per game, with more coming in any Notre Dame blowouts. (Looking at you, Cal and Marshall.)

Recruiting rankings have become uniquely accurate. Plenty of high-profile recruits do not pan out, but broadly speaking, the rankings predict pertinent contributions correctly. With that in mind, some faith should be put in Ekwonu to make the most of those 10 snaps per week and in doing so, earn some more.

DOWN THE ROAD

If Ekwonu can make an impact in 2022, then a large role could be his for the taking in 2023. Notre Dame will be without Foskey and Ademilola, leaving the Vyper role empty. Junior linebacker Jordan Botelho Will Likely spend more of his time in that pecking order once those two veterans do not take up the bulk of snaps, but he will need a partner in chaos.

Ekwonu will have first right of refusal to that role.

If Ekwonu falls short of an impact in 2022, then a transfer would seem more than likely following the season. At that point, some Group of Five program or lower-level Power Five team will be betting on the pedigree of a consensus four-star recruit, an understandable risk.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A senior, Osafo-Mensah has three seasons of eligibility remaining, courtesy of a typical eligibility-preserving freshman season followed by the universal pandemic eligibility waiver glossing over what would have been an eligibility-costing injury in 2020.

Depth Chart: Notre Dame’s defensive line depth has become an asset so strong that it is difficult to peg exactly where Osafo-Mensah stands on it. Fifth-year Justin Ademilola should be considered the “Big” end starter, but his versatility will allow him to also shine at Vyper end, which could elevate junior Rylie Mills to starter status. Osafo-Mensah will be Mills’ backup, be that as the No. 2 Big end or as the No. 3, with junior Alexander Ehrensberger then behind him.

Recruiting: Osafo-Mensah’s recruitment came down to the Irish and his homestate power Texas. The consensus four-star prospect and All-American fell in recruiting rankings late in the cycle, dropping to being considered the No. 23 weakside defensive end in the class after signing with Notre Dame as the No. 9 just two months earlier. In that regard, an All-American Bowl showing can have its risks, though once signed, those recruiting rankings have no impact whatsoever outside of ego.

CAREER TO DATE

Osafo-Mensah missed 2020 due to a lateral meniscus injury suffered that preseason, costing him a chance to make an impact early in his career. After playing in only two games as a freshman, he was poised to help the Irish line stay afloat amid whatever pandemic protocols would eventually compromise it. Instead, he could only practice ahead of the postseason.

Osafo-Mensah moved into the rotation in 2021, most shining in helping put pressure on North Carolina quarterback Sam Howell.

2019: 2 games, both blowouts, 1 tackle.

2020: Meniscus injury.

2021: 12 games, 1 start, 13 tackles with 2.5 for loss including two sacks.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

If the young Irish defensive linemen are akin to the Ninja Turtles, does that make new defensive line coach Al Washington their version of Splinter?

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“A (Khalid) Kareem comparison can go beyond Osafo-Mensah’s large frame and possible positional versatility. Kareem had to wait to get his chance at a starting role, as well, only coming his junior season. Osafo-Mensah will not get that opportunity this year, but he may finally see a moment to contribute.

“(Mike) Elston insists on rotating vast portions of his defensive line, sometimes swapping out the entire line. Going three-deep at the Big end position will aid that cause, and presuming health, Osafo-Mensah should be up to that task, at the absolute least.

“Recruited partly because of his quickness, an agility that has shown itself in practices the last two years when Osafo-Mensah has able to practice, he could benefit from being third on that depth chart. If offensive linemen are worn down by (Myron) Tagovailoa-Amosa and Ademilola, while the third defensive end is not only similarly potent but also fresh, then Osafo-Mensah may find himself in the opponent’s backfield a few times.

“A few tackles for loss would resonate more than a dozen total tackles would, setting up Osafo-Mensah to further impress in 2022.”

2022 OUTLOOK

This space is making a habit of reminding its readership of veterans’ long-ago recruiting rankings, an irony given this space also refuses to delve into the dredges of recruiting coverage. Osafo-Mensah could become the poster child of both those stances.

Osafo-Mensah’s recruitment was a high-profile affair back in the summer of 2018. He held offers from nine SEC programs, including Alabama, LSU and Georgia. While Texas pursued him, his hometown TCU was also joined by Texas A&M. Clearly, Osafo-Mensah projected as a collegiate talent to be feared.

Yet years needed to pass before more than a third-string role was available for Osafo-Mensah. Recruiting rankings yield only so much.

Regardless of that narrative, Osafo-Mensah’s minimal 2021 provides the best projection for his 2022. He did not actually play that much last season, but still Osafo-Mensah made 13 tackles with that pair of sacks, not to mention hassling quarterbacks a few additional times.

The vague phrasing of “did not actually play that much last season” makes an exact projection more difficult, but if Ademilola spends more than half his time at Vyper end, then Osafo-Mensah could double or triple some of those stats in a true No. 2 role at “Big” end.

His strong spring game — 1.5 tackles for loss with half a sack — furthered that thinking. Osafo-Mensah still has the length and speed that made him a highly-touted prospect. Needing some time to get into collegiate shape is not cause for concern. In the long-term, neither is a meniscus injury. Osafo-Mensah should prove all that this fall.

DOWN THE ROAD

First Osafo-Mensah has to validate the preceding logic. If he does so, then growing roles in 2023 and perhaps even 2024 could await him.

The Kareem parallel can hold up in those regards. It was not until Kareem’s third typical season that he found the groove that led to his eventual NFL status. This is, hard as it is to believe, Osafo-Mensah’s third typical season, what with the pandemic and then the understandable delay between a meniscus tear and full-go.

Kareem then racked up 10 sacks across the next two seasons, part of 20.5 tackles for loss.

Such an ascension would be dramatic for Osafo-Mensah, but something of that trajectory could be ahead of him yet.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A fifth-year veteran, Salerno technically has eligibility available beyond this season, but using that season would be quite unexpected.

Depth Chart: If sixth-year receiver Avery Davis returns fully healthy before the season from a November ACL tear, as should be the case, Salerno may be Notre Dame’s backup slot receiver. Wherever he lines up, the former walk-on will not be far down the depth chart, given the Irish have a total of eight scholarship receivers, including both Salerno and incoming freshman Tobias Merriweather.

Recruiting: A former walk-on, Salerno was put on scholarship by new Notre Dame head coach Marcus Freeman shortly after the Fiesta Bowl.

CAREER TO DATE

Salerno first saw action in the Irish blowout of New Mexico in 2019 before working as Notre Dame’s primary punt returner in 2020, though that rarely included actually returning a punt. He reprised that role in spot moments in 2021.

As a receiver, Salerno’s one career catch actually lost four yards.

2019: 1 game.

2020: 11 games, 45 punt return yards on 10 returns.

2021: 11 games, 13 punt return yards on 5 returns, 33 kick return yards on 2 kicks, -4 receiving yards.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Salerno is a known commodity, and a trusted one. The Irish can do worse than lean on him to field punts cleanly. If nothing else, he will not hand an opponent a golden scoring opportunity as (Lawrence) Keys did against the Seminoles.

“But those other possibilities remain more tantalizing, and if one can find some trust from the coaching staff — be it (Chris) Tyree, Keys, (Lorenzo) Styles or even senior receiver Braden Lenzy — then Salerno may become a backup security blanket.

“When Notre Dame handed the job to Salerno, it was that dichotomy that led to the walk-on taking over but also having had to wait a few weeks to do so.

“‘He was effortless back there,’ Irish head coach Brian Kelly said in September, two weeks into the season. ‘He had been back there all camp. We also had Kyren (Williams) back there, and with Kyren’s load and everything he was doing, it just made sense to go with [Salerno] because, like I said, he’s been effortless catching the football.

“‘No, he doesn’t have maybe the kind of explosiveness that Kyren has, but you feel really comfortable with him back there. That’s why we went with him.’”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

A punt returner who will not jeopardize the upcoming possession is not something to take for granted. As dynamic as Kyren Williams was, even he sometimes put the ball at risk. Salerno did not.

Northwestern safety transfer Brandon Joseph may take over at punt returner, if not sophomore receiver Lorenzo Styles, but that is both uncertain and somewhat risky. With Salerno, Notre Dame will know there is no risk, even new Irish special teams coordinator Brian Mason certainly sees that.

If that is the extent of Salerno’s scholarship contributions, so be it. Notre Dame will be better off.

He Will Likely add some catches to the ledger, as well. The Irish are too thin at receiver for anyone to scoff at playing a former walk-on. Lenzy’s legs were rubber by the end of the Fiesta Bowl, when Notre Dame trotted out only four scholarship receivers.

Imagine doing that for an entire season. That is the danger the Irish are toeing. Lenzy, Styles and sophomores Deion Colzie and Jayden Thomas are the only sure things available. Davis should be healthy, and eventually fifth-year Joe Wilkins may join him (Lisfranc injury). Merriweather arrives with much hype, but few freshmen should be viewed as absolutes out of the gate.

Salerno may not be a superstar. Actually, scratch that. The hesitant verb tense is imprecise. Salerno is not a superstar. But he is a clean route-runner who has an understanding of what risks to take and that most risks are ones not to take. He can spare Lenzy, Styles, Colzie and Thomas some fatigue. Whatever the catches and receptions tallies, simply keeping those receivers fresh will be a worthwhile perk for Notre Dame.

DOWN THE ROAD

Salerno may need double-digit catches, triple-digit yards and at least one touchdown for the Irish to even vaguely ponder bringing him back in 2023. Only one receiver is currently in Notre Dame’s recruiting class of 2023, consensus four-star Braylon James (Del Valle High School; Texas), rated the No. 31 receiver in the class by rivals.com, but the Irish should add a big name alongside James by the end of the weekend.

Notre Dame will still be light on depth. Presume the recruiting class grows to three receivers and the Irish find one more in the transfer portal during the winter, and that would be a depth chart of eight names.

A ninth and 10th set of hands would be valuable, but they would no longer be absolutely vital.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A fifth-year veteran, Bracy can play this season only due to the universal eligibility waiver granted in 2020.

Depth Chart: Bracy will be Notre Dame’s starting nickel back in 2022, a position that can no longer be referred to as part of a situational package. Per Pro Football Focus, the Irish defense used five defensive backs on more than half its snaps across the last two years. As good as Notre Dame’s linebackers are, and as deep as the Irish defensive line is, one of those front-seven will come off the field more often than not in favor of a fifth defensive back, which will be Bracy more often than not.

Recruiting: A rivals.com three-star prospect, the San Jose, Calif., native chose Notre Dame over West Coast options like Cal, Utah and Washington State.

CAREER TO DATE

Freshman cornerbacks who play meaningful snaps are rarely only successful. They will be exploited at some point by a strong quarterback and his best receiver. As Bracy moved into the Irish rotation in 2018, that came to be at USC. Yet, he played well enough across the season to help propel Notre Dame into the College Football Playoff.

That kind of backhanded compliment can be applied throughout Bracy’s career. He lost his starting gig as a sophomore and then regained it through much of the pandemic season, a piece of stability for the Irish defense as various defenders entered and exited the lineup due to health and safety protocols.

That was when Clarence Lewis started to chip away at Bracy’s playing time. Now a junior, Lewis will start for Notre Dame alongside senior cornerback Cam Hart, leaving Bracy on the outside looking in … until realizing the nickel back is also very much a starter.

2018: 11 games; 18 tackles with one forced fumble.

2019: 12 games with two starts; 34 tackles with one forced fumble and seven passes broken up.

2020: 8 games with six starts; 24 tackles with two for loss and three passes broken up.

2021: 13 games with five starts; 39 tackles with three passes broken up and one interception.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Perhaps Bracy put together such a strong spring as to re-earn a chance at the field cornerback position, but those events late last season make it unlikely, and all spring, Notre Dame trumpeted Hart as the likely boundary starter.

“That could leave Bracy with nickel back duties. The good news for both him and the Irish: Nickel back work should require less one-on-one coverage, completely isolated from support. Bracy has shown agility and decent hands, so there are tools for Freeman to work with at nickel.”

QUOTES

Last summer’s 99-to-0 entry regarding Bracy then went on to predict a graduate transfer from him this spring. Maybe not at length, but Bracy did at least somewhat consider it this winter.

“I was graduating this spring, and I just wanted to weigh all my options,” he said in April. “But Notre Dame is where I want to be.”

Some of that want likely traces to his presumed nickel role. Playing time comes with it, something Bracy’s inconsistencies have rendered inconsistent throughout his career.

“It shows my versatility,” he said of the position. “(I’m) able to guard receivers inside and out.”

He started to show his fit there last season, working at nickel in most of his playing time.

2022 OUTLOOK

Bracy will play. Notre Dame needs him to. But how much may be up in the air.

Fittingly, an emergence of a freshman may have thrown this fifth-year’s snap count into question. Much hype has followed early-enrolled freshman Jaden Mickey this summer — something that will be dug into a bit at No. 21 in this series — and if he has forced his way onto the field, that is most likely to come at Bracy’s expense.

Lewis and Hart are both clearly ahead of Bracy on the depth chart. With Mickey perhaps there now, as well, suddenly Bracy may be more of a dime back than a nickel back, a package used about a fifth as often, if not less, and one that calls for a third safety as often as a fourth cornerback.

Bracy should fall no further than that, given the absolute youth of the Irish cornerbacks, but his propensity for getting burned deep — USC in 2018 and North Carolina in 2020 both stick in the memory — is not one a defensive coordinator as head coach will tolerate for long.

That was why nickel seemed like a fit for Bracy. The routes run from the slot are less likely to go straight downfield, and when they do, safety help is readily available. He is a physical defensive back not shy from contact inside the tackle box. In those respects, nickel back very much is a fit for Bracy.

It just may not be enough to keep him ahead of Mickey for long. Then again, at some point, a strong quarterback and his best receiver will target that freshman — Notre Dame could not have a tougher season opener in this respect — and the experienced veteran will be needed to staunch the figurative bleeding before it permanently stunts the rookie’s growth.

DOWN THE ROAD

Bracy has plenty of physical tools, but it is still difficult to imagine him getting much of a chance in the NFL. He will certainly go through the requisite combine drills, and perhaps a strong testing day will push him into coveted undrafted free agent status.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A senior, Bertrand has three seasons of eligibility remaining thanks to preserving a year as a freshman and then the universal pandemic eligibility waiver spotting him an extra season in 2020.

Depth Chart: Bertrand Will Likely start at Mike (middle) linebacker, assuming his beat-up wrist allows him to. The starting role may be nominal, as Bertrand looks to be headed toward an equal timeshare with fifth-year Bo Bauer.

Recruiting: Looking back at Georgia’s national championship team sheds some light on Bertrand’s recruitment. A longtime Dawgs commit, he reopened his recruitment a few months before the December early signing period, seemingly in part because Georgia was at least waffling on his scholarship. In retrospect, Kirby Smart’s logic was clear: Bertrand may have been Notre Dame’s leading tackler in 2021, but he would not have even cracked Georgia’s linebacker rotation.

After that de-commitment, Bertrand took two unofficial visits to South Bend — intentionally unintentional so he could commit as a walk-on if need be. Notre Dame did not immediately have a scholarship available, hence that delicate approach, albeit an ultimately unnecessary one.

CAREER TO DATE

Bertrand made four appearances as a freshman in 2019, all on special teams and none making any imprint, before playing in 11 games as a sophomore, again most only on special teams. Though he made seven tackles in 2020, notice remained vague at best aside from tallying three tackles from scrimmage in the 52-0 blowout of South Florida.

When Marist Liufau suffered a dislocated ankle just before the 2021 season, though, Bertrand suddenly had an opportunity, one he would make the most of. He started every game and led the Irish in tackles by nearly double: Bertrand had 101 tackles with Drew White’s 55 the next closest.

Both Bertrand and White wore down as the season progressed, the expected scrapes and bumps increasingly becoming sprains and fractures. With no depth available due to injuries like Liufau’s, Notre Dame simply had no reserves to turn to.

2019: 4 games.

2020: 11 games, 7 tackles.

2021: 13 games, 13 starts, 101 tackles with seven for loss including 1.5 sacks. One forced fumble and one pass broken up.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

Note: This was written long before Liufau’s injury in 2021.

“A lot of special teams work awaits Bertrand, particularly after former Notre Dame special teams stalwart Jack Lamb transferred to Colorado. Polian needs to plug in a similarly skilled player, and Bertrand fits that bill.

“By no means should special teams duties be seen as a pittance for Bertrand. The Irish are simply well-stocked at middle linebacker thanks to the ever-surprising development of White, going from cautionary tale in the spring of 2019 to a three-year starter and possible captain in 2021.

“Freeman seems willing to experiment with Bauer at Will linebacker in order to get him and White on the field at the same time. Bertrand should hope for as much, as it would move him into the two-deep immediately behind White. …

“While White will have eligibility remaining after this season thanks to the universal pandemic waiver, it is more likely he tests his abilities at the next level in 2022, leaving either Bauer or Bertrand to take first-team reps in spring practices.

“Bauer’s decision whether to return or not will be one with ripple effects, and also a hard one to predict. The scholarship crunch coming down the pipe overloads these conversations with contingencies.

“At the risk of being too blunt, it feels most likely either Bauer or Bertrand transfers in 2022. Entering a senior (or fifth-year) season without a starting role sets up a player to find one elsewhere, and that is why transfers are a good thing.”

QUOTES

If a picture says a thousand words, a few photos of Bertrand’s time abroad last month say more than any quote from this winter or spring. He did not partake in much of spring practice as he recovered from a wrist injury, but perhaps even that did not properly underscore how bothersome the injury was given Bertrand was still wearing a brace on his left wrist throughout his European travels. (First visible in the third photo, if scrolling below.)

As Bertrand and White played through injuries last season, their play did dip, but not enough public credence was given to the significance of their injuries. It was not their fault Notre Dame had no depth to turn to.

2022 OUTLOOK

For everyone involved, from Bertrand to Bauer to new defensive coordinator Al Golden to Irish fans everywhere, it should be hoped Bertrand has fewer tackles in 2022 than he did last season. That is not to say Bertrand will be any less effective. It is to say, taking fewer snaps than last year’s ~600 will behoove all.

Bertrand and White had little left to give by the end of last season. Even by October, their wear was showing. When Cincinnati quarterback Desmond Ridder found a crease for the game-winning touchdown in South Bend, that defensive second-level fatigue was apparent. By New Year’s Day, that exhaustion did Marcus Freeman’s defense no favors in the second half.

There were broader issues, but playing through a wrist injury from August was not going to help anyone, let alone Bertrand.

And he still made 101 tackles.

With a more thorough two-deep entering 2022, fewer snaps and thus fewer tackles should not only be possible but considered good things. Bertrand and Bauer splitting time could limit the former to 50 or 60 tackles, but if those come on only 300 snaps, his impact will be no less whatsoever.

DOWN THE ROAD

Bertrand could make a strong NFL case this season, even in that reduced-in-play-count-only role. A highly-touted recruit who fell out of an SEC spot largely because Georgia was putting together a generational defense, he was all over the field in 2021. Another such season would match that recruiting pedigree in a way that would garner NFL interest.

That may be “just” a mid-round grade, but at that point, the question would be what a fifth season at Notre Dame could do to better Bertrand’s draft prospects. If not much, then taking that leap sooner than later would make personal sense.

He may opt for a fifth year, nonetheless, and if so, the Irish will certainly welcome him back. Anyone who racks up 100-plus tackles in a season will be embraced until he chooses otherwise, not the other way around.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Riley has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Notre Dame has its pair of starting cornerbacks in senior Cam Hart and junior Clarence Lewis with fifth-year Tariq Bracy starting at nickel back and filling in wherever else needed otherwise. The exact two-deep behind that trio is murky, with only early-enrolled freshman Jaden Mickey separating himself from the pack of five other freshmen or sophomores with four years of eligibility remaining, including Riley.

Recruiting: Riley made three commitments during his recruitment, bookending a USC dalliance with Irish pledges. The yo-yo nature of his decision-making was understandable given the pandemic prevented him from making an official visit to South Bend, at first committing without making any visit whatsoever. The Washington native then reconsidered that choice and opted to stay closer to his original home, hence the Los Angeles thought, before he did finally make an unofficial visit to Notre Dame.

That swayed him in the end, to the frustration of other Pac-12 powers Oregon and Washington. (Insert some currently necessary acknowledgment of “Pac-12-for-now powers …”)

CAREER TO DATE

Riley appeared in four games in 2021, though he did not record a statistic in those appearances.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Though Notre Dame has made a habit of playing freshman cornerbacks the last five years (Julian Love, Bracy, Lewis), it is unlikely Riley sees extended work this season. If he does, it would indicate a broader failure in the secondary than even most worst-case scenarios would worry about, something more akin to 2016’s rash of injuries that forced Love, Troy Pride and Donte Vaughn all into action.

“Irish special teams coordinator Brian Polian did include Riley among players working as punt returners this spring. If he impresses there in August, he could get a real chance to impact games this fall. …

“Notre Dame’s cornerback depth remains murky in Mike Mickens’ second season as its coach. Bracy could return in 2022, and Hart has plenty of time remaining at his second position (originally a receiver), but Riley represents a truer cornerback than the latter and has less mental scar tissue than the former.

“He has more length than expected from a sub-six-foot defensive back, and his ball instincts are more apparent than most of his positional competition in South Bend.

“Riley will have an opportunity to impress down the line. If Bracy heads elsewhere in 2022, Riley’s first chance could come at nickel back, but if not, the nature of the position mandates options will be needed in time.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Truly, who knows.

The cloudiness among Notre Dame’s reserve cornerbacks will not clear until either a two-deep depth chart loses what Will Likely be a few “OR” designations or the Irish need to turn to a substitute as a starter and the rubber thus meets the world.

Too little has been seen from Riley and classmates Ryan Barnes and Chance Tucker to ascertain anything else, not to mention Mickey, early-enrolled freshman Jayden Bellamy and incoming freshman Benajmin Morrison.

Riley has some of the best fundamentals of the group: Quick hips, strong route recognition and a frame that has added muscle over the year. But if that does not translate on the practice field, not to mention Saturdays, then he may get passed over quickly.

At the least, a reserve cornerback should be counted on for plenty of special teams work.

DOWN THE ROAD

Past recruiting failures led to an overstocking of the cornerback pool in South Bend. Six players have all four years of eligibility remaining. Two more have three seasons yet available, and those are the two starters.

This overstocking has not slowed, nor should it. The trenches still define a college football team’s floor — and thus, Notre Dame’s offensive and defensive lines should carry it to a strong season — but the perimeter sets the ceiling. The Irish need a collection of impressive cornerbacks, and that has not been the case for nearly a decade, if not longer. Thus, the pair of consensus four-stars committing in the last week: Micah Bell and Christian Gray.

Riley may become one of Notre Dame’s starters in 2024. Maybe Hart and Lewis hold all comers at bay until 2025. Whenever that time comes, the point is, Riley will have competition and lots of it.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A junior, Tyree played in 12 games in each of his first two seasons, though of course the universal pandemic eligibility waiver spared him a year of technical usage in 2020, meaning he has three seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Tyree will be listed as Notre Dame’s starting running back in 57 days as the Irish head to Ohio State. Sophomore Audric Estime will be his biggest, if not only, early-season challenge, given the shoulder injury suffered in April by sophomore Logan Diggs and the Achilles injury that will keep early-enrolled freshman Jadarian Price sidelined this fall. Diggs’ return could spare Tyree some carries, and perhaps even that top-listing, in October, but “could” may be doing some heavy lifting in that speculation.

Recruiting: A consensus four-star prospect and at one point the No. 1 running back in the class, Tyree narrowed his recruitment to Notre Dame, Oklahoma and Alabama, most heavily considering the Irish and the Sooners. He committed to Notre Dame seven months before the early signing period, and despite his high-profile status in the cycle, he never wavered from that pledge. Though downgraded to the No. 4 back in the class and No. 78 overall prospect, per rivals.com, by the end of the cycle, Tyree was the second-highest running back recruit of the Brian Kelly era.

CAREER TO DATE

Tyree’s speed mandated he play right away for the Irish, given the general lack of it on recent rosters. He played largely out of the backfield as a freshman before becoming more of a do-everything option in 2021, both years serving as a successful complement to Kyren Williams’ brilliance.

2020: 12 games; 73 rushes for 496 yards and four touchdowns; 8 catches for 65 yards; 456 kickoff return yards.

2021: 12 games, 2 starts; 56 rushes for 222 yards and one touchdown; 24 catches for 258 yards and two touchdowns; 347 kickoff return yards including a 96-yard touchdown return to spark the blowout of Wisconsin in late September.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Notre Dame changed some of its marketing tactics in 2021, a byproduct of NIL rights finally being a reality, giving its players more access to photos and videos taken from the sidelines. Of the many advantages to that approach, it leads to more photos and videos reaching the public, including shots like this from Tyree’s game-breaking touchdown at Soldier Field.

There may be no direct payout associated with that change, but it buoys the players’ social-media platforms, which then leads to larger payouts for them, all good things.

One of those more typical NIL moments, a roster-wide sponsorship with a poster brand, led to Tyree picking out a poster of Dennis Rodman at his finest, a unique choice for a Virginia-native speedster born after Rodman last appeared in the NBA.

Oh, and apparently Tyree has picked up some wheels via NIL, though a more practical version than may be typically expected.

QUOTES

Kyren Williams was a clear leader for Notre Dame the last two seasons. His animated sideline presence made that clear on Saturdays, but it permeated well beyond those 13 annual occurrences, as well. Tyree is expected to replace Williams in the backfield — asked in the spring if Tyree is ready to be the starter, new Irish running backs coach Deland McCullough simply said, “That’s what the plan is. … Chris has the attributes to be the starter here at Notre Dame, clearly.” — but the off-field, locker-room and meeting-room aspect of that may be the real challenge for Tyree, naturally more soft-spoken than Williams’ demonstrative demeanor.

“It’s just been up to me being more vocal,” Tyree said this spring. “Leading by example is not just one thing that a leader does, it’s not what we do here. I’ve been pushed to be more vocal and hold people accountable.”

The push extends past Tyree to the entire running backs group. Williams could provide enough energy to spur all of them. Now, they all need to step forward a bit.

“We’ve grown a lot, especially the last couple months with Kyren being gone,” Tyree said. “I think we understood everyone had to step up a little bit.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Tyree’s freshman season was unprecedented during the Kelly era, and that should be taken more as a reflection of Tyree’s talent than anything else. Coming a carry short of 500 yards in a year in which Notre Dame clearly and admittedly struggled working new players into the offense due to the lack of a true offseason during the pandemic suggests Tyree should be primed for much more in 2021, particularly given his added muscle as a result of that thorough offseason.

“But with an inexperienced offensive line that will need to develop some chemistry, not everything will be as easy for Tyree.

“Tyree should still eclipse 500 yards easily this fall, simply because the Irish will lean on him and Williams to lead an unproven and developing offense. If Tyree ends up near 800 yards, with another couple hundred receiving, then Notre Dame should be scoring plenty to supplement what preseason prognostications expect to be a once-again dominant defense.

“With the mindset of prognosticating, let’s predict Tyree will gain more than 1,000 yards from scrimmage, as well as return at least one kickoff to the opponent’s half of the field. Williams may get the headlines, and deservedly so, but Tyree being even more potent as a sophomore will play a key part in enhancing Williams’ final collegiate season. …

“Yes, this will be Williams’ final year at Notre Dame, barring injury. Running backs simply should not bypass the NFL draft when they have a chance to hear their names called; a running back’s shelf life is too short.

“That will put Tyree in the primary running back role in 2022, which should be his final season. If he can prove to be durable in the next two years — not that Tyree was otherwise in 2020, but at his size, he needs to prove and reprove that trait to the NFL — then his speed will garner attention from the next level.

“He will have assistance. Incoming freshmen Audric Estime and Logan Diggs both look ready to contribute from their arrival, Estime more than Diggs, though neither to the extent that Tyree did. By 2022, at least one should be the reliable backup to Tyree that he and senior C’Bo Flemister are to Williams.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Last year, honing in on a prediction for Tyree’s 2021 output provided an angle for this 99-to-0 entry, but doing so now could simply turn into an exercise of demeaning the rest of Notre Dame’s offense. Tyree and junior tight end Michael Mayer are the only pieces of the Irish attack that are known commodities, and the injuries to Diggs and Price have made it clear, Tyree may need to be a bellcow for Notre Dame, always a risky proposition for any running back, let alone a speed-based running back.

Tyree has more physicality than his speed belies, but his best asset is still his ability to burn down the sideline. Turf toe last season cost him that explosiveness for a bit, just as a sprained ankle did this spring. Nicks impede any running back, but they slow speed backs the most.

A healthy Tyree could blow past 1,200 yards from scrimmage next season. A banged-up Tyree could struggle to roll past 700.

But the Irish will need him healthy. Offensive coordinator Tommy Rees seems poised to attack with a vintage offensive line this season, something that will always be Rees’ underlying preference, though one indulged only when applicable. With just Estime to join Tyree as an established back heading into the season, that approach from Rees will wear on the duo.

Notre Dame could slow down its offense to ease that burden a bit, and against the Buckeyes in particular, shortening the game will be prudent for the Irish, but that can be effective to only an extent.

Tyree will get plenty of opportunities this season. If healthy and spry, that could turn into a prolific year. His injuries have not been the kind to justify concerns about his durability, but the injuries to other Irish running backs do justify concerns about anyone’s durability in the pivotal role Notre Dame needs Tyree to fill this year.

DOWN THE ROAD

A healthy Tyree with a couple big plays this season would garner enough NFL interest to entice him to make that jump. His speed alone will make some front offices elevate his draft grade.

Any running back receiving even a middling draft grade needs to strongly ponder that decision. Tyree going to the NFL after 2022 bodes well for Notre Dame this season, in large part because it suggests he plays most of the season healthy, even if it may worry Irish fans for 2022.

41 Donovan Hinish, incoming freshman defensive tackle, Kurt’s brotherNo.","Listed measurements: 6-foot-1 ⅝, 222 pounds.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A senior, Kiser still has three seasons of eligibility remaining thanks to preserving a year in the traditional fashion as a freshman and then having another year kept on the proverbial shelf thanks to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver in 2020.

Depth Chart: Kiser should be Notre Dame’s starting Rover in 2022, a nomenclature that dates back to Mike Elko‘s arrival in 2017. The phrase “Rover” sticking around through four defensive coordinators underscores the increasingly ubiquitous nature of hybrid players in a defensive front-seven.

Recruiting: By the common definition in the recruiting industry, a consensus three-star prospect is not widely considered a player that will start for multiple seasons at a Power Five Playoff contender. Kiser has far exceeded that projection. The one-time Mr. Indiana Football debated between the Irish and Purdue, not genuinely considering any programs from outside the state.

CAREER TO DATE

Kiser dabbled in four games in his debut season in 2019, and he looked to be heading toward that role in a full season in 2020 before a pandemic outbreak along Notre Dame’s defense heading into its second game forced Kiser into a starting gig against South Florida. Earlier that week, he had been working on the Irish scout team.

“You always have to be ready,” Kiser said after receiving the game ball for making eight tackles with two for loss. “On scout team, your goal is always to make it up and get to the next level, so when (I) found out, it was just a mentality, let’s go.”

Kiser’s one-week cameo was exactly that, one week, but he still played in 11 games throughout the season and his impressive showing against the Bulls led to more playing time even when the regulars were around.

Both those regulars — Shayne Simon and Marist Liufau — were injured in 2021, as was Paul Moala, once again pushing Kiser into a starting role, this time more consistently. Kiser made the most of that time, finding the end zone against both Wisconsin and Georgia Tech.

TD NOTRE DAME ! Pick 6 Jack Kiser. 10-0. pic.twitter.com/VJpQ2C8O3v — Notre Dame France ☘️🇫🇷 (@NotreDameFR) November 20, 2021

2019: 4 games.

2020: 11 games, 1 start; 20 tackles with three for loss and one interception and one pass broken up.

2021: 13 games, 8 starts; 45 tackles with one for loss and two forced fumbles, two interceptions, two touchdowns and seven passes broken up.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Kiser is not one that asks for much attention, despite his on-field highlights. Nonetheless, the hashtag he puts alongside his social-media reels is one that could catch the eye of many Notre Dame fans on apparel. “Jackpot” could have some intriguing Irish tie-ins.

QUOTES

Kiser’s three-star recruiting status obviously tied to his physical attributes. He is not the fastest player on the field nor the biggest, but he does many things well. One could even call him … Don’t do it, Douglas … a jack of all trades.

Terrible and obvious pun aside, Kiser’s ability to both pressure a quarterback and drop into coverage could help him help new Irish defensive coordinator Al Golden’s push for further varied defensive looks.

“Be available on any given play,” Kiser said of a springtime emphasis. “For me, that’s learning the Mike (middle linebacker), learning the Will (weakside linebacker), learning the Rover, nickel if I have to. Anything and everything.

“That’s been the emphasis throughout the whole (linebacker) unit. Be that guy that can do everything. That makes you valuable on game day.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Kiser’s 2021 may depend on Moala’s health, and as much as Kelly insisted throughout the spring that the local product was ahead of schedule as he returned from one of the worst injuries that can befall an athlete needing explosion to excel, maybe some skepticism should insist on seeing Moala at full speed before believing it.

“Perhaps Kiser handles the bulk of the Rover work through September and then Moala rotates in once a full year removed from the injury in October.

“Whatever that timetable ends up being, Kiser should be a part of Freeman’s plans. His spot duty in 2020 was too thoroughly consistent to be ignored moving forward.

“That may produce two dozen tackles and a handful of pass breakups, a solid step forward for someone who was on scout team before a coronavirus outbreak threatened to halt Notre Dame’s season a year ago. “A handful of pass breakups” may sound optimistic, but as much as Kelly acknowledged Kiser’s shortcomings in coverage, he did make an interception last season and then another with style this spring. …

“The Irish have built reserves of linebacker depth such that Kiser will need to compete for playing time every season he remains in South Bend. That is a good thing for the program and nothing but an encouraging challenge for Kiser.

“Moala likely will be around through at least 2022, furthering those position competitions.

“At some point, Notre Dame will need to trim linebackers. At the absolute least, before Kiser has exhausted his eligibility in … 2024. The coming and growing scholarship crunch will leave no other option.

“Kiser will continue to contribute as long as he wants to keep playing, but in 2023 or so, that may need to be elsewhere, through no fault of his own.”

2022 OUTLOOK

The Irish enjoy linebacker depth these days, provided health. Kiser’s rise should emphasize that health among linebackers is not to be assumed. Behind Kiser, junior Jordan Botelho worked at Rover this spring in an endeavor to get him on the field more this year despite Notre Dame enjoying top-tier defensive ends. Botelho is too talented to not play more, and that may mean Kiser gives up some snaps, particularly on passing downs.

That is not a bad thing. Depth is only a good thing.

Kiser’s role will not go away. Botelho will offer a defensive wrinkle, not a replacement. A year of starts should be ahead of Kiser, and along with them 50 or so tackles. A pair of touchdowns may not be repeatable, but Kiser will be a notable piece of Golden’s approach.

DOWN THE ROAD

Marcus Freeman’s one recruiting cycle as defensive coordinator led to three high-profile linebacker recruits. His first recruiting cycle as Notre Dame’s head coach has already led to the commitments of a pair of consensus four-stars in Drayk Bowen and Preston Zinter.

Kiser is far enough ahead of them all in experience and physical maturity that it is hard to envision him getting recruited over. Not to single out players, but that will be more a conversational topic for the likes of sophomore Will Schweitzer, a former defensive end recruit.

But as the roster fills with the recruits Freeman is chasing, the odds of Kiser sticking around through 2024 diminish. Kiser most likely plays a typical college career of a three-star-turned-starter, working from a redshirt to a fifth-year defensive leadership position before trying to catch on in some summer workout sessions in the NFL.

2022-23 year, eligibility: An early-enrolled freshman, Bellamy has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Depending how thorough the official depth chart is this season — as in, does it include the nickel back or not — Bellamy may be listed, but in reality, he will not be within the two-deep. Should starting nickel back Tariq Bracy suffer a long-term injury, Notre Dame would more likely turn to early-enrolled freshman Jaden Mickey or one of the number of safeties — perhaps junior Ramon Henderson — before it inserted Bellamy into a week-in, week-out coverage role this season.

Recruiting: A consensus three-star prospect and the No. 46 cornerback in the class, per rivals.com, Bellamy ignored much of the Northeast in choosing the Irish. While his recruitment focused on Notre Dame and Penn State, he was also offered scholarships by Ohio State, Florida State and Clemson.

QUOTES

Do not assume Bellamy remains at cornerback throughout his career. Part of why he chose Notre Dame is that the Irish were open about seeing him fit anywhere in the secondary.

“When they were looking at my film, they could see me playing nickel and corner and safety,” Bellamy said in February. “That was the biggest part, being able to move around the ball. Being around the ball is fun, so that was the biggest part.”

Regardless of his long-term fit, it sounds like even Bellamy recognizes it may not result in much playing time in 2022.

“The place I’d like to develop is probably my strength right now, but I feel like as I go on, it’ll be my footwork,” he said. “I feel like the receivers are getting way better and are coming out with new routes and all of that. I feel like footwork and strength will be a big part.”

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN BELLAMY SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“You can’t teach speed, and Bellamy has it. Not much else needs to be said. …

“Bellamy’s speed creates interesting possibilities. It alone could make him a punt or kick returner possibility in 2022. More likely, he takes some time to develop, but do not rule it out.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Bellamy’s speed may find him a role on special teams coverage units, but working in the secondary seems unlikely. Presume Bellamy is entrenched at nickel back for this fall. Before he would take over, Notre Dame would turn to Bracy, Mickey, Henderson and even fifth-year safety Houston Griffith, not to mention perhaps sophomore cornerbacks Ryan Barnes, Chance Tucker and Philip Riley.

Rattling off vague options will be a common theme at cornerback and nickel back for the season, where six players have all four seasons of eligibility remaining. To put that another way, six players are largely unknowns.

Of those six, Bellamy may be the slightest.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

DOWN THE ROAD

Add some heft to that speedy frame, though, and then Bellamy will look like an ideal cornerback. A full year in a collegiate strength and conditioning program should have Bellamy on that track by next spring. Furthermore, he clearly knows that needs to be an emphasis.

Speed cannot be taught. It is a truism for a reason. At some point, that should be enough to get Bellamy on the field for the Irish secondary.

Bracy is in his final season; it is hard to imagine Notre Dame keeping both junior Clarence Lewis and senior Cam Hart into their final seasons of eligibility in 2024. The Irish safeties are about to begin rapid turnover with Griffith and fifth-year DJ Brown out of eligibility and Northwestern transfer Brandon Joseph possibly a one-and-done player when it comes to seasons in a gold helmet.

Opportunities will begin popping up for Bellamy next spring if he has added some strength and worked on that footwork.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Walters has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: In the short term, Kyle Hamilton’s injury last season was troublesome for Notre Dame. In the long run, it helped the Irish develop future safety depth, though perhaps at Walters’ expense. Experimenting without Hamilton led to the rise of now-juniors Ramon Henderson and Xavier Watts. Along with the incoming transfer of Northwestern’s Brandon Joseph, Henderson’s and Watts’ progress knocked Walters down to the third-string.

Recruiting: A consensus three-star prospect and the No. 37 safety in the class, per rivals.com, the Chicagoland product considered plenty of Big Ten schools.

CAREER TO DATE

Walters appeared in four of Notre Dame’s first five games last season, all on special teams, before he then preserved a year of eligibility. While he made three tackles in those appearances, that usage pattern suggests the Irish coaching staff was on the fence about playing him the whole season in September, eventually opting against it, perhaps due to their musings about Henderson and Watts. Neither was practicing at safety that early in the season but those moves were logically already being considered by then-defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“(Brian) Polian, also the special teams coordinator, went so far as to describe Walters as a “fast riser” when it comes to special teams work. If Walters becomes a primary contributor on Polian’s coverage units, then that alone may push him past the four-game threshold, and that in turn could elevate him in the safety rotation.

“Hamilton is unlikely to come off the field until the Irish are up by three touchdowns, and senior Houston Griffith is competing with senior DJ Brown to serve as Hamilton’s primary running mate, so the safety rotation will not run deep, but Notre Dame will win games by three touchdowns — this space is routinely hinting these days at a prediction of two blowouts in the first three weeks — and Walters may be the beneficiary of those routs.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Notre Dame may not have a safety like Hamilton anymore, a luxury few teams ever enjoy, but the Irish have a glut of possible contributors along the defensive back line. In addition to Joseph, Henderson and Watts, fifth-year veterans DJ Brown and Houston Griffith have been trading playing time for a few years now.

All five of them may be ahead of Walters on the depth chart, keeping his defensive work to a minimum this season.

His early-season cameos on special teams last year, however, bode well for larger such roles now. Notre Dame will not need to rein him in to preserve eligibility anymore.

Known as a hard hitter in his recruitment, Walters will get a chance to show that ability on kick and punt coverage units.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

DOWN THE ROAD

Brown and Griffith will certainly wrap up their collegiate careers this season. The earliest mock drafts suggest Joseph could be a first-round pick in 2023. Suddenly Notre Dame’s safeties room may be thin again.

Henderson should be a lead contender for one of the two starting roles in that scenario, but after him, the Irish will have plenty of space for competition. Even if Walters does not emerge as a starter — current class of 2023 commits Adon Shuler and Peyton Bowen are both good enough to warrant at least some preliminary consideration, as well — he should find a role in the rotation in 2023.

At that point, Walters will be halfway through his eligibility, one year behind both Henderson and Watts. It will thus become increasingly clear if he has a pathway to ample playing time at Notre Dame.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Diggs has three seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Diggs was set to exit the spring as Notre Dame’s No. 2 running back behind only junior Chris Tyree before a labrum injury suffered in the Blue-Gold Game put his September availability into doubt.

Recruiting: Diggs’ recruitment came down to a longtime Irish commitment and a late LSU push. From just outside of New Orleans, the Tigers’ late interest forced the No. 19 running back in the class to thoroughly consider them.

That winter of 2020-21 possibility led to vague speculation Diggs may follow Brian Kelly to Baton Rouge a year later, but he nipped that thought in the bud as quickly as he could.

CAREER TO DATE

Diggs grew into a needed backup role in his debut campaign, not playing in Notre Dame’s first five games — at least partly due to a COVID bout late in preseason practices — but then handling a significant workload in the final eight. When realizing he played in only eight games, his 52 carries and six catches stand out, an average of 7.25 touches per game for the freshman, highlighted by a 28-touch stretch across three games.

The Irish needed Diggs due to shallow depth in the running backs room, with C’Bo Flemister mired on the sideline for the season and Tyree struggling with a turf toe injury late in the year.

2021: 8 games; 52 carries for 230 yards and three touchdowns; six catches for 56 yards and one score.

He then took four carries for 10 yards and three catches for 20 yards in the 2021 Blue-Gold Game, a costly cameo as he tore his labrum in the exhibition.

QUOTES

Diggs’ injury will be costly not only in that it robs the Irish of depth early in the season but also in that he was primed to be Notre Dame’s 1B running back, rather than truly a No. 2. That day may yet come down the line, but in the interim, it could also be argued the injury will help Diggs in some ways.

In his first season, he said his understanding of the game developed more than anything else. Being forced to watch from the sideline, now equipped with that bit more knowledge, could lead to further such growth.

“I would say my game grew the most in the understanding of football,” he said in December. “Being in the film room, understanding blocking schemes better, knowing what I have and the receivers have in their plays.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Opportunities will come in the long run. Williams will head to the NFL after this season, barring injury, and both Tyree and Flemister should be gone no later than the end of 2022.

“That will leave (Audric) Estime and Diggs in 2023, and a running back rotation is vital to health. They will be running behind the likes of left tackle Blake Fisher, by then perhaps a three-year starter, and Rocco Spindler, only not starting as a freshman this season because of an All-American transfer. Current junior center Zeke Correll could even still be around as a fifth-year center in his fourth season of starting.

“Whoever is lucky enough to carry the football for Notre Dame in 2023 should be doing so behind an offensive line to be thankful for.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Based on comments from Irish head coach Marcus Freeman in late June, do not expect Diggs to be cleared for contact when Notre Dame faces Ohio State in seven weeks. Yes, 49 days.

“We’re not going to rush that timetable to get back for the Ohio State game or anything else,” Freeman said to Irish Sports Daily.

But Diggs is expected back sometime in September. Logic and caution could conceivably push that back into October, simply given Notre Dame’s two games after opening against the Buckeyes should both be less competitive. If the Irish can then get by without Diggs at North Carolina on Sept. 24, he could have the idle week before taking the field against BYU.

If Notre Dame is not going to rush him back, not facing the Tar Heels to gain two more weeks before being tackled would fit the same thought process.

At that point, Diggs will be on the same trajectory as a year ago. He missed the first month, and then his role only grew with each passing week.

Tyree will remain the lead Irish ball carrier, but Diggs could help move Tyree to a hybrid gig supplementing the receivers. If complementary Diggs had 52 carries as a freshman, prominent Diggs could approach 90-100 carries as a key piece in nine games to end the season.

Simply for the sake of having this down as a projection, let’s predict Diggs will run for more than 400 yards in 2022 and tally more than 500 yards from scrimmage, a rather impressive stat line for someone with such an uncertain timetable for his return.

DOWN THE ROAD

Tyree could play his way into the NFL draft this season, but it is just as likely he returns to Notre Dame in 2023. At that point, the Irish will have a bounty of depth at running back. Diggs’ stats may thus not explode, but that will be a good thing for his long-term future.

Diggs’ debut season was impressive enough to force an acknowledgment that he may head to the NFL after 2023. Any contributing running back needs to consider that. A reduced workload will more likely give him comfort in returning for a senior season in 2024, and a showcase role could eventually be all his.

Running back depth should not be taken for granted. It was perilous before transfers were afforded immediate eligibility, not to mention injuries will always lessen a room’s possibilities during the season. (Or, for Notre Dame this year, the offseason.)

If the Irish enjoy five running backs in 2023, there is no certainty they will again in 2024, but for as long as they are able, that luxury should preserve these players, even at their statistical expense.

2022-23 year, eligibility: An early-enrolled freshman, Mickey has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Mickey impressed this spring to such an extent it is easily conceivable he could be the backup to either senior Cam Hart or junior Clarence Lewis this fall.

Recruiting: The southern California native was sought by plenty of programs in the Pac 12, but chose Notre Dame over Oregon, Cal and Northwestern just two months after Marcus Freeman had begun as the Irish defensive coordinator.

QUOTES

Despite considering Oregon and Cal, Mickey’s focus on midwestern academic programs like Notre Dame and Northwestern made it clear early in his recruitment that he had an interest in leaving home for college.

“Definitely going far away from home can develop you as a young man, being away from your parents — you can’t just drive home on the weekends to go see them,” he said this February, about a month into that experience as an early-enrolled freshman. “It definitely builds some structure in living your life on your own.”

Of course, Mickey could have left home and still enjoyed better weather than he was facing in northwestern Indiana in early February, but he insisted the South Bend winter was hardly as worrisome as advertised.

“I’ve loved it out here so far,” he said. “It’s not as bad as everybody makes it seem. You still see the sun. People make it seem like you’ll never see the sun, it’s going to be sad.

“But you still see the sun. It snows a lot, it’s cold, you wear a couple jackets and it’s all good.”

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Mickey is smartly branding himself early, before most Notre Dame fans even know who he is. Establishing himself in that regard will eventually lead to a uniform line of apparel and perhaps a few more sponsorships.

For now, therealjadenmickey.com features only sponsorships from a couple trainers.

More interesting than those acknowledgments of Ballers Elite, Rharebreed and Dawg Houze, Mickey also blogs on his personal website every couple months. He does not go elaborately in-depth into his life, but that bit of voice will, again, help him capitalize on his name, image and likeness in years to come.

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN MICKEY SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“Mickey prefers to play man-to-man coverage, which makes him an ideal fit for Freeman’s scheme, but at only 6-foot, he likely will work as the field (wide) cornerback, rather than work along the boundary. …

“Mickey’s active hands will further his fit in Freeman’s aggressive scheme. Not only are they capable of picking off quarterbacks, they often disrupt receivers’ routes in his highlight film. …

“If Mickey’s talent translates at the collegiate level, there is little reason he could not crack the Irish rotation in 2022. Notre Dame has its starting cornerbacks in Cam Hart and Clarence Lewis, but little else is certain in the Irish secondary at the moment.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Rarely can certainty accompany a freshman’s playing time, but for Mickey, there is no doubt he will play in 2022. Freeman has made that clear, both specifically in regard to Mickey and in general about playing freshmen.

“Jaden Mickey, he came in the winter and after 3-4-5 days ‘That dude’s going to play,’” Freeman said to Irish Illustrated this summer.

Notre Dame needs him to. The Fiesta Bowl faceplant emphasized the growth the Irish need from their cornerbacks, and while much of that should come from Hart and Lewis developing, some of it will come from newcomers — namely, Mickey.

Even if it was not a position of need for Notre Dame, playing talented freshmen is an absolute necessity in modern college football. With frustrated players now able to transfer elsewhere and have immediate eligibility, rewarding them on the field is more vital to roster construction than ever. Even if a talented player should not start because someone else is better ahead of him, finding him chances to shine will help keep him on campus for years to come.

“I want to make sure they’re ready, but the ability to play freshmen is so important, because it’s two-fold,” Freeman said to Inside ND Sports. “One, we’re going to demand that our players play at such a high level, give such a high effort, you’re going to have to play more than 11 guys on offense and 11 guys on defense. You’re going to have to roll guys in. …

“The other aspect of that is to make sure that they’re involved in the game. They come here to play. If they’re ready to play, let’s play them.”

Mickey is ready to play.

Keeping in mind that defenses use five defensive backs more often than any other alignment, there will be opportunities for Mickey. Furthermore, and this is going to be blunter than intended simply for brevity’s sake, fifth-year nickel back Tariq Bracy has been played off the field in at least one game in at least three of his seasons. If another such afternoon begins to get away from Bracy, Mickey may find himself with a heavier workload for a week.

DOWN THE ROAD

Mickey’s competitive edge is a solid foundation for any cornerback, and his quick hands will propel him to early playing time, but he will need broader development to usurp either Hart or Lewis before their careers conclude. They each have three seasons of eligibility remaining, though Hart probably will not play through a sixth season.

Bracy, meanwhile, will finish his career this season. Mickey may slide right into the nickel role in 2023, essentially a starting gig, if not one that will lead to a start tally every week.

Now running back depth concerns will also trouble the Irish. Notre Dame announced Friday morning that early-enrolled freshman running back Jadarian Price ruptured an Achilles tendon in offseason training and will miss the 2022 season.

Price underwent surgery on Friday.

Without Price, the Irish are down to just three healthy scholarship running backs in junior Chris Tyree, sophomore Audric Estime and freshman Gi’Bran Payne. Sophomore Logan Diggs is recovering from a shoulder injury suffered in the Blue-Gold Game, and the timing of his return is uncertain but likely to extend into the fall.

In modern college football, that is not enough. Not when a turf toe sidelined Tyree for chunks of 2021. Ponder a sprained ankle to Tyree or Estime in mid-September. Suddenly Notre Dame would have only the other and a yet-to-practice freshman to lean on. Late September could include a blowout at North Carolina, but the Irish would have only walk-ons to offer mop-up carries. More likely, Tyree or Estime and Payne would need to salt away the win.

To dig into the loss of Price, let’s differ to the usual summer format of Notre Dame 99-to-0: No. 20 Jadarian Price, sophomore running back now out for the season …

Listed measurements: 5-foot-10, 190 pounds.

2022-23 year, eligibility: An early-enrolled freshman, Price has four seasons of eligbility remaining, a clock that now will not start ticking until the Irish head to Ireland in August of 2023.

Depth Chart: Price’s strong spring may have moved him up as high as No. 2 on the Notre Dame running back depth chart, particularly after Diggs’ injury. Now, precious few backs are available for the Irish.

Recruiting: A consensus four-star recruit and the No. 5 running back in the class, per rivals.com, Price shirked his homestate power, Texas, as well as Ohio State and Stanford when he chose Notre Dame. As he did so, he pointed to one distinct difference between the Irish and two of those programs.

“There’s one thing that really stands out and it’s just the mindset that they’re going to the College Football Playoffs every year,” Price told Irish Illustrated when he committed in February of 2021. “That’s just what they’re all about. That’s their motto. That’s their DNA. They’re going to the Playoffs every year.”

QUOTES

Price so starred in the spring finale that he was one of two players made available to the media after the game. His nine rushes for 12 yards and eight catches for 104 yards and a touchdown had not immediately gone to his head, though.

“I may be a young guy on this team, but I’m willing to do whatever needs to be done,” Price said. “Whatever role I need to play in order for us to win, and that’s what it’s all about.”

It took a week or so of spring practice for Price to realize he was not simply playing Texas high school football anymore. A veteran Notre Dame linebacker made reality clear in the simplest way imaginable.

“The third practice, we went live and just hit,” Price said. “I got my first welcome to college football experience when (senior) Marist (Liufau) hit me in practice. That really prepared me, this is real. I’m going to go out and show what I can do.”

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN PRICE SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“Price brings an ability to accelerate out of a cut and evasive hips to emphasize that cut, along with enough speed to simply run away from a defender. His game will need some maturing and at 175 pounds — at least, that is his listed weight — he will need to add a bit of muscle, but Price has all the tools Notre Dame looks for. …

“With Kyren Williams off to the NFL and C’Bo Flemister likely headed elsewhere as well to find more playing time, Price could suddenly be the fourth Irish running back in 2022. “Fourth” may not seem like a notable spot on the depth chart, but Notre Dame has often used a fourth back to chew up clock in blowouts. Furthermore, current sophomore Chris Tyree may be used more and more on the outside, both to supplement the Irish receivers and to give more opportunity to current freshmen Logan Diggs and Audric Estime. At that point, Price may be Notre Dame’s third genuine running back. …

“Running back depth is crucial in modern college football, and the Irish have slowly built some. Pairing Price with the duo a year ahead of him may tamper some of their stats, but it will best serve all interests.”

Achilles injuries are among the worst imaginable for athletes dependent on explosive moves, as a running back is. Price’s return may reach into the 2023 summer, but presuming no setbacks, he should at least be healthy enough to practice by that preseason.

Only then will it be clear if his Blue-Gold Game star turn will be a one-off or if this injury is just a bump in his road.

With them, along with a trio of unproven sophomores, it is hard to envision Morrison working his way into the 2022 rotation.

Recruiting: Cornerback factories chased Morrison, despite being ranked only the No. 30 cornerback in the class, per rivals.com. Both Washington and Alabama chased the Phoenix product, choosing Notre Dame over the Huskies despite a lifelong dream of playing for Washington.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Morrison may bridge a gap to better relations with Michigan for Irish fans. Well, probably not, given those two fanbases continue to despise each other despite not having any games scheduled for the future. Regardless, Morrison’s older sister is a star gymnast for the Wolverines.

She may be in a better position to capitalize on NIL rights in the short-term than Benjamin is. Female student-athletes have raked in a significant chunk of NIL revenues in the year that doing so has been legal, and as a junior, Naomi’s presence will be more notable than Benjamin’s as a freshman.

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN MORRISON SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“Morrison has a longer wingspan than expected of someone standing 6-feet. If that is matched by physicality, he could end up as a boundary cornerback. …

“Any defensive back sought by Washington and/or Alabama should be considered an impressive get, even for Marcus Freeman amid a hot stretch in recruiting.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Is it likely Morrison plays his way into the Notre Dame two-deep this fall? No. Is it impossible? Certainly not.

Consider Mickey’s narrative rise — using the descriptor “narrative” because until he is seen in August practices, the insistences he will play this fall still lack literal evidence. Mickey did play well in the spring, and combining that with his recruiting pedigree makes for an understandable thought of him playing at Ohio State in 47 days.

But how much different is Mickey from Morrison? The No. 19 cornerback in the class, rather than the No. 30, Mickey is nearly an inch shorter than Morrison.

Could an impressive August from Morrison match Mickey’s impressive spring? If so, then Morrison may have found his way into the 2022 rotation, and the Irish will be delighted at cornerback for a few seasons, a welcome change for the defense after years of wonder on the perimeter.

That is all obviously a hypothetical, but it is one to underscore the lack of tangible value to spring showings. Notre Dame will lean on whoever shows up in August much more than worry about anything from April.

DOWN THE ROAD

At some point, the glut of young cornerbacks will thin out. With Clarence Lewis and Cam Hart both likely returning to start in 2023, some among the six cornerbacks with four years of eligibility currently remaining could end up elsewhere.

That is simply a math thought, especially when adding in the reality that the Irish have added two cornerback commits in the class of 2023 who would both have been higher-rated recruits than Mickey in 2022.

Some among those six — to list them in full: freshmen Mickey, Bellamy and Morrison; sophomores Philip Riley, Chance Tucker and Ryan Barnes — may dabble at safety or receiver. Some may transfer.

That future consideration will be in the back of minds as the pecking order is established in August and September.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Tucker has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Notre Dame has its pair of starting cornerbacks in senior Cam Hart and junior Clarence Lewis with fifth-year Tariq Bracy starting at nickel back and filling in wherever else needed otherwise. The exact two-deep behind that trio is murky, with only early-enrolled freshman Jaden Mickey separating himself from the pack of five other freshmen or sophomores with four years of eligibility remaining, including Tucker.

Recruiting: The consensus three-star prospect chose the Irish over most of the West Coast, led by Washington, Washington State and Arizona. Any defensive back sought by the Huskies should be considered a worthwhile recruit, simply based off Washington’s recent track record of developing NFL talent at the position. As an Alabama offer boosts a running back’s résumé, so should a Huskies pursuit for a cornerback. The No. 41 cornerback in the class, per rivals.com, Tucker was also pursued by five Ivy League programs.

CAREER TO DATE

Tucker did not take the field on a Saturday in 2021, unlike his two classmates at cornerback. Both Philip Riley and Ryan Barnes played in the maximum four games allowed while still preserving eligibility, though they both also enrolled early in 2021 while Tucker did not arrive at Notre Dame until the summer.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Former Irish players have long fundraised via their lifting performances at their combine, something they could do only because they were done playing college football. Yes, they could not raise money to combat rare diseases because of archaic NCAA rules.

Nowadays, the Irish can do better, and they will on July 22 in their annual “Lift for Life.” Based on his Twitter activity, Tucker is on the team headlined by senior linebacker JD Bertrand and junior running back Chris Tyree. That team intends to manage 450 max leg press repetitions.

To donate to the cause, click this link.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Special teams work is a valuable contribution, but if that is Tucker’s focus in 2021, Notre Dame is unlikely to use him in more than four games so as to preserve a season of eligibility.

“Even after Lewis and Bracy, one presumes the Irish would give sophomore Caleb Offord an opportunity at cornerback before turning to Tucker, unless the latter truly impresses in preseason practices with his length and strength. (For what it’s worth, so as to avoid a misleading pun, many synonyms such as “opportunity” and “shot” and “hopes” have been used in this article. Maybe that effort will not be necessary once Tucker is closer to his own … chance.)

“Listed at 165 pounds, though perhaps actually closer to 180, a bit of work in the weight room would behoove Tucker. Even for a fleet cornerback, playing that far below 180 can make most receivers difficult matchups. Consider, at 5-foot-9 ⅛, Shaun Crawford finished his career playing at 180. Tucker should play around 190.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Tucker not playing in 2021 was not a shock. He played mostly receiver in high school; time was needed to adjust to cornerback.

Time may still be needed, but there is no advantage to sitting Tucker any longer. Some Saturday tests will reveal how he is taking to being on defense full-time.

Yet, those tests may be few and far between. Notre Dame’s starting trio of Lewis, Hart and Bracy will have some leash, especially early in the season. Behind them, Mickey, Barnes and Riley look best positioned to step into roles. Then, perhaps only then, the Irish might turn to Tucker.

Aside from that, some special teams contributions feel like a default for Tucker, even at sub-six-foot.

DOWN THE ROAD

Notre Dame has employed a shotgun approach in cornerback recruiting the last two cycles to compensate for follies in the two cycles beforehand. Natural roster attrition has played a part in the Irish having only one recruited cornerback to show in the current junior and senior classes, but the primary fault was the initial recruiting. Hart was a receiver convert; only Lewis is a cornerback recruited as such of that age.

Pulling in seven cornerbacks in the next two classes, the current freshmen and sophomores, has given Notre Dame multiple chances to find competent depth, but it will eventually lead to a bottleneck at the position.

Both Lewis and Hart should start for the Irish in 2023, as well, though Notre Dame will need a new starting nickel back. That slim opening will not be enough to satiate seven cornerbacks along with the pair of star recruits currently committed to the Irish in the class of 2023.

Tucker may not be the piece of that traffic jam that takes the off-ramp, but someone will, and to this point, he is at the back of that line.

2022-23 year, eligibility: An early-enrolled freshman, Angeli has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Sophomore Tyler Buchner will start for Notre Dame at Ohio State in 46 days with junior Drew Pyne as his backup. One of them would need to suffer a long-term injury for Angeli to enter the two-deep in 2022.

Recruiting: The label of “a rivals.com three-star prospect” may be misleading given Angeli’s first offer came from Ohio State, one of 10 Big Ten programs to chase the New Jersey product. Multiple schools in each Power Five conference sought Angeli, but he curtailed any aggressive recruiting pitches by committing to the Irish in March of 2021 despite the then-year-long recruiting dead period keeping him from any offiical visits.

QUOTES

Under previous head coaches, a freshman like Angeli would not meet with the media until, at earliest, the spring following his freshman season. More likely, he would wait until preseason practices before his sophomore season.

Instead, Angeli has already done so twice, a welcome change and acknowledgment from new Irish head coach Marcus Freeman that these 18-year-olds are more ready than not to face the public.

Consider Angeli to be Exhibit A. During his recruitment, long after he had committed to Notre Dame, the Irish began chasing other quarterbacks in the class. That would have upset plenty of prospects. Most likely, such a player would arrive at Notre Dame and dodge any questions about it with Crash Davis-approved clichés. Angeli, instead, offered seemingly honest responses to that recruiting choice from Irish offensive coordinator Tommy Rees.

“My conversation with [Rees], he’s always been real and honest and up front with me,” Angeli said in February. “If there was tough stuff he had to tell me, I just respected him so much, knowing that we had such a good relationship. Being able to tell me, it is what it is.

“The real stuff, he’d never lie or sugarcoat anything. He was just telling me how it was. I really respected him for that.”

That honest dynamic, along with Angeli’s innate competitive streak, allowed Notre Dame the flexibility to consider another quarterback, though one never did join the class.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

If there was ever an early-enrolled freshman positioned to make some money off his name, image and likeness, it is the quarterback who provided the last-second, game-winning touchdown in the Blue-Gold Game.

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN ANGELI SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“A pro-style passer, Angeli may be more in the mold of Jack Coan than Tyler Buchner, but he can still get out of the pocket when need be, not afraid to hurdle a defender or spin out of a sack, as his highlight reel makes clear. …

“The Irish quarterback room in 2022 currently holds four names, and that includes current freshman Ron Powlus. He was brought into the class of 2021 to give Notre Dame a third healthy quarterback, before Coan transferred from Wisconsin, so there is not an inherent expectation that the Irish will seek another transfer; they already have four healthy passers. But that will also mean Angeli may be one snap away from being one snap away.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Notre Dame has every hope to not look to Angeli in 2022. Buchner and Pyne both logged enough snaps last season to quell any thought whatsoever of Angeli turning the starting competition into a three-passer race. He is No. 3 on the depth chart with no controversy whatsoever.

Tbat should lend Angeli to the scout team for some practices and to the second-string for the rest while Buchner and Pyne split the starting reps during the week. Angeli will have a chance to further adjust to the speed of collegiate defenses as well as learn Rees’ playbook. He fared relatively well in both respects in the spring, but relatively is doing some work there. By no means did Angeli look like he would be competing to be the Irish starter if either Buchner or Pyne were elsewhere.

Rees knows better than anyone, though, that a freshman quarterback has to have some readiness in order for his head coach to sleep at night. If the starter suffers an injury, the third-string freshman immediately becomes the backup. That’s how Rees ended up starting four games in 2010 as a freshman, moving up from backup status when the initial injury replacment was so lackluster.

Similarly, Brandon Wimbush lost a year of eligibility in 2015 because he needed to be ready enough to start after Malik Zaire’s ankle injury. Wimbush needed meaningful snaps to be comfortable if that “break glass” moment arrived.

The confidence Angeli showed in leading that 10-play, 83-yard game-winning drive in the spring finale bodes well for those concerns. He would not need a much more thorough handle of the playbook to be able to serve in spot roles.

That is a scenario the Irish would like to avoid, but it is one they need to have thought through, nonetheless.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

DOWN THE ROAD

Not to risk overreacting to a spring scrimmage, but if not for Angeli’s play in the Blue-Gold Game, this section would border on dismissive.

He threw for 180 yards and a touchdown on 11-of-17 passing that day, adding the game-winning score on his sole carry, heading for the pylon as soon as he crossed the line of scrimmage 10 yards away.

More than his stats, it was the awareness on that final play that inspires some larger expectations moving forward.

“Watching the clock, I know we have to get a play off,” Angeli said afterward. “We were in our tempo calls.

“I got the play, looked up at the clock, saw it at about nine seconds left and I was like, I gotta get going. Took the snap, went out, saw the corners kept backing up, gave a few pump fakes, they kept reacting, and then I just went for the front pylon.”

Not to be hyperbolic, but that kind of detailed description of a chaotic moment was impressive from Ian Book after his last-minute touchdown scamper to beat Virginia Tech in 2019 and from Jack Coan on his last-minute touchdown pass with an injured finger against Toledo in 2021. To get it from a high school senior was astounding.

Buchner should start for at least 2022 and 2023, and probably 2024. At the moment, though, there is no quarterback commit in the class behind Angeli. That will inevitably change before December’s early signing period, but the nature of quarterback recruiting suggests that eventual signee may not be of the pedigree that immediately cements Angeli as an afterthought.

Depth Chart: Sneed will be in the mix at Rover, now occasionally referred to as Sniper, but he enters preseason practices well behind senior Jack Kiser and junior Jordan Botelho. If Botelho spends more time along the defensive line, that could be seen as an indicator that Sneed has quickly proven himself worthy of added playing time.

Recruiting: An Under Armour All-American, a Butkus Award finalist and the No. 46 overall prospect in the class, Sneed considered only Oregon about as much as he did Notre Dame. All along, the Irish had an advantage, though. Well, if not all along, as soon as Marcus Freeman was hired as defensive coordinator in January of 2021, they did. Freeman has long known Sneed’s high school coach, BJ Payne, a connection tracing back to Freeman’s wife, Joanna.

Thus, Freeman had a bit of an inside track on chasing Sneed early on.

Sneed was already keen to trust his high school coach’s judgment, as it had proven prophetic before. A few weeks into his freshman year, Sneed remembers Payne talking him up as a future star.

“He told me I was going to be something special one day, and then after that day, he took me in as one of his own,” Sneed said this February. “Just has taught me up and taught me how to be a man and just grown me from what I was freshman year to what I am today.”

Sneed did not believe his coach until a year later, when he realized he was keeping up with the seniors on the team.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Wait a second, did Sneed get a sponsorship deal with the Hyatt Place in South Bend for a month of lodging early in the summer? More power to him if so, this is just a bit ambiguous.

Depending when that month was, he may have been there when he signed a representation deal with Octagon, a prototypical management and marketing firm.

One has to think Sneed was able to get some free gear from Fabletics on his own, though.

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN SNEED SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“Sneed’s broad shoulders do not rob him of quickness, making him a threat both in pass coverage and in pass rushing. He makes quick and correct decisions that speak to both football instincts and a willingness to study film. …

“Sneed’s profile is that of a player too good to keep on the sideline for long, so Freeman will need to find a way to get him on the field, and rover feels like the most likely destination, even as Jack Kiser still has three years of eligibility remaining and freshman Prince Kollie has yet to get his chance.

“Linebacker depth will be a great problem for the Irish to have, one that is hardly a problem, as evidenced by this year’s rash of injuries.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Kiser’s knack for making plays makes him Notre Dame’s clear starter at Rover, and he has proven to be durable over the years, most notably remaining available against South Florida in 2020 when much of the defense was not.

Botelho’s presence among the linebackers this spring underscored the Irish need to get him on the field. He is too physically talented to not play, even if neither defensive end nor linebacker seems to perfectly encompass his skill set.

That puts Sneed in a tough position if wanting to be in the rotation as a freshman. Obviously, that is not an absolute necessity, but with someone as talented as Sneed, it cannot be ruled out.

Coverage is where linebackers usually struggle initially in college. They simply are not asked to do it that often in high school, as Sneed wasn’t, but proving himself on the camp circuit erased that worry.

At the least, Sneed should find a niche defensive package he can contribute to. Perhaps that is goal-line situations. Maybe it is third-down specific. Any such gig will create half a dozen opportunities each week for him to leave an imprint on the game.

Add in certain special teams duties, and Sneed should play in most games this season and end with 10-plus tackles.

DOWN THE ROAD

Kiser has three seasons of eligibility, but this space will continue to assume sixth years will be rare occurrences. If granting that presumption, then Botelho will be Sneed’s primary competition for the starting role in 2024, except by then, Botelho likely will be stationed firmly at Vyper end.

Vyper end is the most hybrid position in the current defensive alignment, and Botelho is a player tailor-made for a hybrid role. Once both Isaiah Foskey and Justin Ademilola depart Notre Dame after this season, plenty of playing time will await Botelho at Vyper end, leaving Sneed behind Kiser at Rover.

Taking some time to break out at Rover is becoming the common trend at the position. Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah did not command everyone’s attention until his junior year. Kiser did not earn a starting role until his junior year. Sneed taking over as Kiser departs would fit that exact timing.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A senior, Joseph has three seasons of eligibility remaining. His timeline may be more confusing than most, simply as a transfer, so to phrase that another way: Joseph can conceivably play college football through the 2024 season.

Depth Chart: Joseph will start for Notre Dame this season. The only question is which safety will start alongside him. Fifth-year DJ Brown may be the frontrunner, but classmate Houston Griffith is not far behind, nor is junior Ramon Henderson.

Recruiting: The rare incoming transfer at Notre Dame, the Irish were a distinct option for Joseph as soon as he announced his intention to leave Northwestern. Nonetheless, it took some work to get him through the transfer admissions process in South Bend, one area of the University specifically targeted for improvements by new head coach Marcus Freeman.

The other hurdle to any transfer is finding a home on the roster. To Freeman, that aspect is simple.

“I told the players, so we’re always on the same page, we’re always looking to enhance our team,” he said in December. “We’re always looking to find a better way. That’s it. Challenge everything.

“If there’s a better way, if there’s a better person or someone out there that’s going to enhance our roster, then we’re going to investigate it for sure. But as I told the coaching staff and I told the players in the team meeting, we will never bring somebody into this program that we don’t feel is the right fit.”

CAREER TO DATE

Joseph played in only two games in his debut campaign, preserving a year of eligibility. Thus, when he is described as an “All-American freshman” occasionally, recognize it is with an asterisk.

Nonetheless, in only eight games during the 2020 pandemic-shortened season, Joseph racked up 46 tackles and six interceptions. One pick against Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game was noted more than all the others, including since Joseph’s transfer.

His 2021 was not as highlight-driven, in part because nothing tied to Northwestern football featured many highlights in 2021.

2019: 2 games; 4 tackles.

2020: 8 games; 46 tackles, six interceptions and two passes broken up.

2021: 12 games; 79 tackles, three interceptions, four passes broken up and one fumble recovered.

Joseph also returned four punts in 2021 for 114 total yards, an average of 28.5 yards per return.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

One of the more enjoyable aspects of NIL rights has been the leasing of cars to players. That has long been a common tactic employed by local dealerships with players preparing for the NFL draft. The player rode in style from December through April, before he had secured significant money from the draft. At that point, the dealership trusted his first luxury car would come from them, be it bought or leased. Win-win.

That same general concept now applies to active college players, as well, including Joseph, with the added benefit for the dealership that he gives them some social media buzz.

Personally, I’d go for an Aston Martin before an Alfa Romeo, but beggars can’t be choosers.

QUOTES

Make no mistake about it, Joseph chose to transfer to Notre Dame with a purpose in mind. The bigger stage and, frankly, better team should better his NFL prospects.

“I came to Notre Dame to maximize my potential,” he said in January. “Joining an elite defense like this, having a piece like me, they’re returning eight starters and losing a guy like Kyle (Hamilton), so I figure a guy like me stepping in and filling in the piece of the puzzle is exactly what we need to take this place to the next level.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED WHEN JOSEPH TRANSFERRED IN JANUARY

“Part of that right fit is how a player meshes with the Notre Dame locker-room culture that was such an emphasis in Freeman’s hiring process, and part of that fit is simply getting into the University, particularly difficult for any undergraduate transfer. The latter worry was less of a hurdle given Joseph was coming from Northwestern, and that helped allay the former concern, as well. Receiver Bennett Skowronek fit in well with the Irish in 2020 after transferring as a graduate student from the Wildcats. His impression left the coaching staff more open to Northwestern possibilities in the future.

“Joseph played some cornerback early in his Wildcats career, and while he excelled as a safety, his real use to Freeman may be as a defensive back utility knife of sorts. Notre Dame relied on a three-man rotation at safety after Hamilton’s season-ending knee injury — seniors DJ Brown and Houston Griffith and sophomore Ramon Henderson — with a fourth impressing more and more in the final weeks, sophomore receiver-turned-linebacker-turned-safety Xavier Watts. Meanwhile, the Irish have remained young and short-handed at cornerback, a roster failure for years now.

“If the safety group contains more than two of Notre Dame’s best defensive backs, cornerbacks coach Mike Mickens and safeties coach Chris O’Leary may find ways to get more safeties on the field, even if that means they line up and play as cornerbacks.

“That may be Joseph, or his presence may lead to one of those other names — Griffith and Henderson, in particular, have past experience dabbling at cornerback — to move in the defensive backfield.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Repeated preseason All-American lists have included Joseph on the first- or second-team. That may surprise anyone who did not closely watch Northwestern football the last two years … so it may surprise just about anyone. But it should also be viewed as a compliment to Notre Dame’s defense.

A ball-hawk safety can excel when the defensive front-seven is menacing, and the Irish front-seven may deserve such an adjective. That will be to Joseph’s immense benefit.

Interceptions can be a fickle way to judge a player’s contributions — and Joseph’s 6.25 tackles per game the last two years should project him into Notre Dame’s top-three tacklers in 2022 — but the takeaways are also the linchpin to Freeman’s preferred defensive approach. Since the Irish resurgence began in 2017, four interceptions in a season has been the high-water mark, set by Jalen Elliott in 2018 and matched by Hamilton in his freshman season in 2019.

That has also been the high-water mark for nearly a decade, dating back to Manti Te’o’s seven interceptions in 2012.

Joseph has the attributes of someone who could break that mark of four, though perhaps reaching Te’o’s seven (and Harrison Smith’s seven in 2010) will be a task too far.

DOWN THE ROAD

For every preseason All-American mention Joseph has received, he has been mentioned twice as a possible first-round draft pick in 2023.

He may have eligibility to play at Notre Dame through 2024, but it is most likely this is Joseph’s one season in South Bend.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Colzie has three seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Either Colzie or classmate Jayden Thomas should start at boundary receiver in 2022. Colzie had the lead in that competition entering the offseason, but Thomas turned it into a tight race during the spring, partly due to Colzie suffering a concussion that cost him reps in the earlier practices.

Recruiting: A consensus four-star and the No. 19 receiver in the class, per rivals.com, Colzie committed to Notre Dame in October of 2019 before backing off that early in the pandemic to consider some of the impressive schools offering him a scholarship, including Alabama, his hometown Georgia and Oregon.

By the following September, still unable to visit South Bend due to the pandemic-induced recruiting dead period, Colzie chose the Irish over Tennessee.

CAREER TO DATE

Colzie played in 11 games as a freshman, catching four passes for 67 yards. Perhaps more notably, he took 166 snaps last season, a number boosted simply by Notre Dame’s dearth of receivers. Even if he was not reliably getting open or consistently targeted, the Irish needed Colzie to run routes because there were hardly any others to do so.

Oddly, though — and this is both a criticism of Colzie and a testament to Thomas — he took only three snaps in the Fiesta Bowl, when Notre Dame was down to four receivers, despite running 70 pass plays.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Colzie’s Instagram suggests he has a sponsorship deal with “It’s Just Wings,” an Atlanta-area restaurant specializing in, of course, chicken wings. That is the type of NIL usage everyone can get behind.

QUOTES

Colzie’s height, length and leaping ability — he cleared 6-foot-8 in the high jump in high school — differentiate him as a receiver, including how new receivers coach Chansi Stuckey works with him.

“The base foundation are the things that go with everybody,” Colzie said in April. “Stance and start, top of the route, catching the football, that’s the base of every receiver and they need to do it well.

“Coaching a guy like Deion, he’s a jump ball guy who has a big body. I put more emphasis on him trying to do that very well with the foundation of what we’re trying to do. Deion isn’t going to run option routes like [Lorenzo Styles] is.”

RELATED READING: What Chansi Stuckey looks for in Notre Dame’s wide receiver recruits

How Notre Dame is pushing WR Deion Colzie to meet his potential

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Colzie runs a 10.82-second 100-meter dash. He leaps 6-foot-8 in the high jump. Colzie already enjoys a physical skill set that sets him apart from nearly all other receivers in the country, a skill set that will make him an ideal boundary receiver with body control when out-jumping opposing cornerbacks for deep routes and back-shoulder comebacks alike.

“But Notre Dame’s offense is notoriously difficult for freshman receivers to grasp enough to earn playing time. Wilkins, for example, has long been considered capable in all regards, but he had to wait two seasons to get a chance on offense.

“‘Definitely a difficult offense,’ Wilkins said after he broke through for a week last year. ‘We have a lot of plays, a lot of different formations, the same play out of different formations, it’s a lot to it. Coming at it as a freshman, you’re thrown this huge playbook and you have to know it. It’s rough, it’s definitely rough learning the plays.’

“If Colzie can prove to be the exception to that rule, he may already be physically ready to back up Austin, if not replace him should the senior once again fail to remain available be it by injury or otherwise.

“If not, the Irish are likely to play Colzie in only four games so as to preserve a year of eligibility for a player who may be enough of a future star as to render that long-term caution moot.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Track and field times and measurements do not directly translate to the football field, but the athleticism they demonstrate broadly does. Colzie not only jumped 6-foot-8 in high school, he also ran a 10.82-second 100-meter dash. Those are not numbers that typically go together.

Colzie has an athletic skill set that should make him a devastating boundary receiver, very much in the mold of Miles Boykin and Chase Claypool … in time.

It would be a surprise to see him rise to that level in 2022, but since Notre Dame has no one else in his mold, he should see plenty of opportunities this year. Styles stands 6-foot-1 ⅛, and neither fifth-year Braden Lenzy nor sixth-year Avery Davis cracks 6-foot. Thomas is a relatively big-bodied receiver, but he stands all of 6-foot-1 ½.

Unless incoming freshman Tobias Merriweather, 6-foot-4, immediately usurps Colzie, the sophomore should work the sidelines throughout the year. If he has developed a comfort catching the ball on his back shoulder, he could be a welcomed safety blanket for sophomore quarterback Tyler Buchner.

Or, Colzie could struggle through the season, as he did in whatever way that led to his nearly-literal no-show in the Fiesta Bowl. That may be crippling for Notre Dame, simply given he is one of only seven scholarship receivers healthy to start the season, a number that includes former walk-on Matt Salerno.

DOWN THE ROAD

The best collegiate cornerbacks struggle with a dynamic 6-foot-4 receiver in one-on-one coverage. That is Colzie’s ceiling, and it is a thought that would open up the Irish offense for the next few years.

As long as he gradually trends toward that ceiling, Colzie will be given chances at Notre Dame. That leaping-speed combination is too rare to not ease along.

Furthermore, while the Irish receivers corps will gradually grow in numbers, that will take years. The trio of currently-committed receivers will help the cause, but even if that grows to a group of four by December, Notre Dame will have only eight or nine receivers next season, barring transfers. Half of those will be freshmen.

The Irish desperately need Colzie to become a threat along the sideline, one Buchner can turn to for 12 yards on third-and-longs, one that eats up snaps because there is no one else available, one that shows long-term potential even amid this short-term crisis.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A freshman, Merriweather has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: A strong preseason could push Merriweather into Notre Dame’s two-deep, especially if sixth-year Avery Davis is not yet full-go when the Irish face Ohio State in 44 days. Davis should be, but if not, then Notre Dame will have only six scholarship receivers available, including fifth-year former walk-on Matt Salerno.

Most likely, sophomore Lorenzo Styles, Davis and fifth-year Braden Lenzy will start. In that alignment, Merriweather could find a role backing up any of them, but particularly the field (wide) or slot receivers, leaving the boundary reserve duty to sophomore Deion Colzie.

Recruiting: The No. 22 receiver and No. 135 overall prospect in the class, per rivals.com, Merriweather was the only receiver the Irish signed in the class of 2022, despite long being one of three well-respected committed prospects. Staying firm in his commitment despite pursuits from Oregon, Washington and UCLA could have been the long-term memory of the Washington product’s recruitment. But instead …

Merriweather’s house was the last stop for Brian Kelly as Notre Dame’s head coach. Kelly infamously stepped outside early in the visit to take a phone call before returning to eat a few platefuls of burnt ends. As the Irish coaches left the Merriweather’s house, Kelly denied the rumors of his impending departure to LSU, not only to the Merriweathers but also to his assistant coaches.

QUOTES

Merriweather’s next notable recruitment moment came almost immediately after Marcus Freeman was named the Irish head coach. Following his introductory press conference, Freeman boarded a flight ultimately bound for Washington to see Merrriweather after a brief stop in Wisconsin to woo offensive guard Billy Schrauth.

“I know the minute we got done with the press conference, obviously, we had to go see Tobias,” Freeman said in December. “That’s the first place we got to go. … To get him a part of this class is huge. It’s huge. We were in his house I think 9:30 West Coast time at night, so it was almost midnight here or after midnight. That was a very important get for us.”

Those two at-home visits were quite literally just a week apart, yet they could not have had more disparate tones.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Merriweather’s father, Dom, is apparently quite the expert with barbeque, including those burnt ends. Most NIL deals do not include a tie-in to a player’s parents, but perhaps some local restaurant in South Bend should make an exception.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED WHEN MERRIWEATHER SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“If Merriweather remains this lean, the Irish will want to play him on the field (wide) side of the formation, typically a less physical position. If he bulks up in a collegiate strength and conditioning program, then Merriweather’s height and length could make him an ideal fit along the boundary, a la Miles Boykin, Chase Claypool and Kevin Austin.”

2022 OUTLOOK

A touch of curiosity can be disappointed Kelly will not coach Merriweather this season. For most of his 12 years at Notre Dame, Kelly failed to incorporate freshmen receivers. Though not an exhaustive list, the most notable contributions came from three freshmen in those 12 seasons:

TJ Jones in 2010: 23 catches for 306 yards and three touchdowns.

Kevin Stepherson in 2016: 25 catches for 462 yards and five touchdowns.

Lorenzo Styles in 2021: 24 catches for 344 yards and one touchdown.

It is not that it would have been a shock to see Merriweather match those lines, it is that Kelly turning to a freshman in two consecutive seasons would have been a mild shock.

But, of course, he would not have had a choice. The Irish are so thin at receiver, a freshman like Merriweather is practically assured two dozen catches for 300 yards. He may be a bit slighter than would be preferred, but he has enough physical assets to handle a modest workload, especially against lesser opponents. (Looking at you Marshall, Cal, Stanford and UNLV.)

Merriweather won the state championship in the 200-meter dash in 21.8 seconds and finished second in the 100-meter dash in 10.94 seconds. Those may not be the kind of times that will lead him onto the track in college, but they are impressive marks regardless, especially when remembering Merriweather is 6-foot-4.

More may be possible. Maybe Kelly would have played Merriweather even on a deep team. Perhaps he will shine against Notre Dame’s top opponents, as well. Those are hypotheticals.

The stark reality is Merriweather will play this season out of necessity, and he will play a good amount.

DOWN THE ROAD

The receiver situation in South Bend will take time to rectify. If Merriweather had bailed out of the signing class, the depth chart would have begun to look untenable. When the margin of error is one recruit, clearly the solution will be a multi-year process.

In the interim, Merriweather will work with the current sophomore trio — Styles, Colzie and Jayden Thomas — to provide the bulk of Irish catches through 2023 and 2024.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Barnes has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Among the six cornerbacks with four years of eligibility remaining, Barnes may be the one most likely to see genuine time in 2022. He should enter the season in the two-deep as senior Cam Hart’s backup.

Recruiting: How do you prefer to gauge a recruit? Based on recruiting rankings? Then Barnes was a middling prospect, a consensus three-star prospect and the No. 60 cornerback in the class, per rivals.com.

Or do you consider scholarship offers to be the better indicator? Then Barnes was a top-tier recruit, chased by Clemson, LSU, Oregon and USC, even though he is a Maryland native.

The vast disparity between the two thought processes — often a difference, but not usually to this degree — can somewhat be traced to Barnes’ lack of a senior season (pandemic) cutting into his chances to impress the recruiting coverage industry.

CAREER TO DATE

There may be little-to-no practical difference between freshmen who play four games early in the season and freshmen who play their four games to end the season, but from a narrative standpoint, the difference is stark. By playing in four of Notre Dame’s final five games last year, including the Fiesta Bowl, Barnes gave the impression of closing the season strong and in the most important games of the year.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Enrolling a semester early may have put Barnes in better position to play in 2021, but the growing depth at cornerback for the Irish means that is still not an excellent chance. Notre Dame has added pieces at corner diligently the last few recruiting cycles. Add in receiver-turned-corner junior Cam Hart, presumed boundary starter, and suddenly the Irish may not be as desperate at cornerback as they have seemed to be every couple seasons for the last decade.

“Nonetheless, Barnes’ length could make him an intriguing piece if needed. Two things remain beyond teaching at cornerback, speed and length, and Barnes already has half that combination to a degree perhaps only Hart can genuinely match in the position group.

“It is most likely Barnes sees minimal action in 2021, perhaps in a few blowouts or maybe in a very specific matchup against a physical receiver. …

“Barnes could move to safety in years to come, something openly acknowledged during his recruitment, but his most likely destination may be boundary cornerback, where his length could be best utilized.

“Hart should have that position to himself for the next two seasons, giving Barnes some time to work on the finer pieces of his technique.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

The Irish starting trio of Hart, junior Clarence Lewis and fifth-year nickel back Tariq Bracy is well established. Beyond them, Notre Dame has nothing but questions.

It would be unnecessarily ambitious to suggest Barnes will be one of the answers to those questions, but along with early-enrolled freshman Jaden Mickey, he does seem most likely to genuinely fill a backup role. Obviously, that will lead to some snaps when the respective starter needs a breather or rolls an ankle, but it will also lead to one of Barnes or Mickey seeing plenty of dime action.

The nickel package is utilized more often than not, and the dime package — needing at least six defensive backs — is far from a rarity. Notre Dame’s depth at safety will make it so the sixth defensive back is usually among them, but specific matchups may require Barnes or Mickey.

Aside from that, Barnes should be a lock for punt coverage, perhaps on every single such snap. That alone could lead to half a dozen tackles.

DOWN THE ROAD

Barnes has the physical attributes to ease into a starting role once one is available. Bracy will conclude his career this season, and Hart may see fit to chase the NFL, though a fifth year for the converted receiver still feels most likely.

If Barnes gets a handful of reps at cornerback this season and handles them with aplomb, he will immediately have a leg up on the rest of the bounty of unknowns in the position group.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A freshman, McFerson has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: McFerson will have to prove himself in the very first preseason practices. Notre Dame brought in Harvard transfer Jon Sot, a walk-on now, to have some experience at the punter position after Jay Bramblett transferred to LSU, and then Irish soccer goalie Bryan Dowd took part in spring practices to add any springtime depth at the position. Dowd will have plenty of obligations to his primary sport in the fall, so McFerson’s competition will be Sot.

Recruiting: A one-time Wake Forest commit, McFerson wavered quickly once Notre Dame chased him. A quick visit to South Bend in mid-November sealed his flip.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

It is not by accident that the name of McFerson’s specialist coach is in the background of his All-American graphic on Instagram. Chris Sailer Kicking may be the standard of working with preps kickers, and when they find success, it is appropriate they help publicize Sailer.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED WHEN McFERSON SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“As the Irish realized they would need a punter in 2022, they quickly identified and pursued McFerson, more a compliment than anything that would be written here could be. …

“Current junior Jay Bramblett is expected to transfer, with immediate eligibility, to play closer to his home of Tuscaloosa, Ala., something former Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly essentially confirmed in late November. That created the need for McFerson, as he should be the Irish punter in the 2022 opener at Ohio State. …

“Notre Dame will not sign another punter until it expects McFerson to head elsewhere, barring a complete disaster in his performance. Thus, McFerson should handle these duties through the 2025 season.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Sot has enough experience to not be doubted in any respect. Of his 57 punts last season, he set 24 inside the 20-yard line. His career average of 40.8 yards per punt would be a comfortable version of steady for the Irish.

Comparatively, McFerson has a higher long-term ceiling, but a freshman fielding his first collegiate long snap at Ohio State in front of nearly 105,000 fans in 42 days — yes, exactly six weeks — may be a bit too worrisome for Notre Dame.

It will not be too shocking if Sot handles the duties this season. The Irish brought him in with that as a known possibility.

Make no mistake, McFerson will have his chance to prove his leg is too strong to be sidelined due to hypothetical nerves. Special teams coordinator Brian Mason has a very simple method of choosing a punter, he said this spring.

“Whoever punts the ball the farthest the most is going to punt.”

DOWN THE ROAD

While some things will continue to change under first-year head coach Marcus Freeman, Notre Dame is not about to start carrying multiple punters on scholarship. Even Sot is in South Bend as only a preferred walk-on. The Irish chased McFerson because Bramblett was leaving, something Kelly knew was coming for much of the season, though before he also headed to the SEC, it was presumed Bramblett would transfer to Alabama.

All of which is to say, McFerson should be Notre Dame’s punter through 2025, or perhaps 2026 if Sot indeed handles the duties in 2022.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A freshman, Payne has all four seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Payne went from luxury to necessity as sophomore Logan Diggs tore his labrum in the Blue-Gold Game and early-enrolled freshman Jadarian Price suffered an Achilles injury during summer workouts, injuries that elevated Payne from fifth-string to third-string all before he even arrived on campus.

Recruiting: Payne was recruited by Deland McCullough to Indiana, and the consensus four-star prospect and No. 21 running back in the class, per rivals.com, signed with the Hoosiers during December’s early signing period. When McCullough moved to be Notre Dame’s running backs coach, Payne asked Indiana to be released from his National Letter of Intent.

The Hoosiers had no obligation to grant that ask, but did so, and Payne reopened his recruitment in March. The Cincinnati product narrowed his choices to the Irish and Kentucky before committing to Notre Dame in mid-April.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

WHAT WAS PROJECTED WHEN PAYNE SIGNED IN APRIL

“The No. 14 prospect in Ohio in the class, Payne runs through arm tackles with ease and typically gets through the line of scrimmage quickly. The broad Cincinnati area is far from lacking in football talent, but Payne still made a habit of running away from his competition throughout high school.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Post-February signings are so rare, Payne cannot even be deemed an exception that proves the rule of most players signing in December. If he had signed with the Irish in February, he would have warranted such a note. By joining the class of 2022 in April, Payne became a once-every-four-years anomaly.

That may be mentioned a few times early this season and then quickly forgotten, both of which will underscore how vital he suddenly is to Notre Dame. Payne has a decent build already, and when healthy in high school he looked much better than the No. 21 running back in the class. He should be able to contribute right away, at least in a moderate role.

The Irish need him to. With Diggs likely out for most, if not all, of September and Price sidelined for the year, Payne will be the No. 3 back at Ohio State in 4o days.

Let’s frame that reality in a harsher way: When Notre Dame takes the field in front of nearly 105,000 fans against a national-championship contender, the Irish will have as few as eight total receivers and running backs that were scholarship recruits. Assume at least four of those are on the field on more snaps than not; Notre Dame will have to turn to its running backs to have a complete two-deep at the skill positions in September.

Junior Chris Tyree may work at receiver some, leaving only sophomore Audric Estime and Payne in the backfield. For that approach to work, Payne has to have proven himself in preseason practices.

That alone will prompt reminders of his late recruitment and signing. Producing in the fall will lead to that storyline falling down the proverbial inerted pyramid as his actual in-game showings will earn more merit.

Predicting Payne’s 2022 stats is difficult given Diggs’ timeline to return is murky, but it is a near certainty that Payne will lose a year of eligibility this season, playing in far more than four games. He may play in every game in September and then serve as the mop-up back in blowouts of Stanford, UNLV and Syracuse in October. In one of those, he should break loose a long run to the end zone, giving these unexpected duties at least one highlight.

DOWN THE ROAD

This offseason’s injuries emphasize the precarious nature of both running back depth and any running back’s future. That may be reason enough to push Tyree to the NFL after this season. If not, then he will almost assuredly take that jump after the 2023 season; four seasons of college carries will have taken enough off his career’s lifespan.

That will leave Diggs, Estime, Price and Payne. Both Diggs and Price have impressed in the last year — Diggs obviously in the fall and Price this spring — while Estime and Payne are the more unknown factors. This September should give a better idea of future pecking orders, simply because Estime and Payne will get chances to match Diggs’ and Price’s impressions.

Regardless, the Irish will need as much depth as they can hold onto in the future. That was the basic reasoning to chasing Payne after the recruiting cycle had concluded, anyway. He may well rise to the top of that depth in due time, but the most crucial aspect for Notre Dame will be simply preserving that depth as a whole.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Buchner has three seasons of eligibility remaining after appearing in 10 games last season.

Depth Chart: Barring injury, Buchner will be Notre Dame’s starter at Ohio State in 39 days. Disabuse any notions of a preseason quarterback competition. If Irish head coach Marcus Freeman claims one exists, recognize it is a competition in name only. Junior Drew Pyne will be Buchner’s backup this season.

Recruiting: Unlike the quarterback recruitments of the last six months, Buchner made life simple and drama-free. He committed to Notre Dame nearly two years before he could sign, and despite the typical list of powerhouses chasing the No. 112 overall player in the class and the No. 6 dual-threat quarterback, he never wavered from that commitment.

CAREER TO DATE

Buchner took the field for the first time in the second game of his freshman season, working in a sub-package role even if former Irish head coach Brian Kelly insisted that was not the case. Buchner’s first career snap featured him taking the snap around the right side of the line for a 26-yard gain from deep inside Notre Dame’s own territory, part of rushing seven times for 68 yards against Toledo to help spur a stagnant Irish offense. He also completed all three of his pass attempts that afternoon, gaining 78 yards largely due to a 55-yard catch-and-run touchdown courtesy of Chris Tyree.

He would not work as more of a passer than a runner until starter Jack Coan utterly struggled at Virginia Tech, leading to Buchner starring for two quarters. While he ran 12 times for 67 yards and a score, he also threw for 113 yards and a touchdown on 6-of-14 passing.

But two of those eight incompletions were interceptions, and then a sprained ankle forced Buchner to the sideline. Coan led a game-winning drive, spawning the largely-successful “Hurry Up Jack” offense. With that momentum, Buchner’s role diminished through the end of the season, to the extent that he did not even play in the Fiesta Bowl.

2021: 10 games; 21-of-35 passing for 298 yards with three touchdowns and three interceptions. 46 carries for 336 yards with three more touchdowns.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Buchner did not get a cut of offensive coordinator Tommy Rees’ pay raise this winter, but Buchner and the rest of the quarterbacks publicly calling for one in order to retain Rees was one of the more notable moments in the chaotic first week of December for Notre Dame football.

QUOTES

A knee injury and then the pandemic robbed Buchner of what would have been years of starting experience in high school. Instead he started for only one season and threw 439 career passes in high school. Adding in 35 pass attempts last year helped his growth, and he showed both progress and mistakes reading live coverages, but that was all only a start.

He is, in every way, still a very young quarterback. Even Buchner realizes development is ahead of him, including in his throwing motion.

“Throwing-wise, it’s my front shoulder,” he said this spring of needed progress. “Keep my front shoulder tight and keeping a good base. Really using the ground to get as much power as I can into the throw.”

Buchner likely noticed that need in film study, something he takes to eagerly, partly because his brain works in a way one might not expect from a college freshman or sophomore. In November on the ND on NBC Podcast, when Jac Collinsworth asked Buchner what he would do for a career if he could not play football, the then-freshman responded with a very practical yet ideal answer.

“If in a purely hypothetical world I played in the league and had enough money, I would retire, teach high school history and be a high school football coach,” Buchner said. “… I just really love history. It’s one of the things in school I’ve always had a passion for. I’ve always been interested in those classes.

“I think you can learn a lot from history, not make the same mistakes people did. I think it’s fun looking at — it’s kind of like watching film, honestly, in football. You’re [looking over] everything that happened and the strategy and the things people did. You can learn from that, or that worked well, do that again.”

Some of that same logic probably also plays a role in Buchner’s occasional online poker hobby.

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“After Buchner’s effective Blue-Gold showing, Kelly would not rule out finding a way to get the freshman on the field this fall, but that should be viewed more as vernal coachspeak than reality.

“Five quarterbacks previously enrolled early during Kelly’s 12 springs at Notre Dame, and only Rees ever found genuine playing time in his freshman season, a necessity created by a late-season injury to Dayne Crist. (The others: Everett Golson, Gunner Kiel, Malik Zaire, Drew Pyne.)

“The Irish have two quarterbacks to consider in Coan and Pyne, both with more and more recent playing time than Buchner at any level. Well, perhaps not more recent for Coan, but leading Wisconsin to the Rose Bowl counts by magnitudes.

“Buchner will have plenty to work on this fall, simply in reestablishing muscle memory and learning the entire offensive playbook. Whatever helps get that done, he should focus on, and then Notre Dame fans can also look forward to him impressing in a few blowouts throughout the season, spurring unnecessary but inevitable debate about why he isn’t already playing more. …

“Irish fans may be scarred by Phil Jurkovec’s great recruiting hype followed by absolutely no production at Notre Dame, scars now brought back to the sunlight by hype surrounding Jurkovec and Boston College this summer, but Buchner is not Jurkovec. The comparisons should not continue, simply because one-to-one comparisons hold little merit in any such conversation given the obvious nature of the sample size.

“Buchner’s time will come in South Bend; as of 2022 his primary competition will be Pyne, who aside from a year’s head start under Rees, has little advantage over Buchner. Until Clark can make it through 12 months without a knee concern, that will be his dominating storyline.

“In 2022, Buchner and Pyne will be a quarterback competition worth fretting over, unlike this summer. If Pyne is the better quarterback, that will be a good thing for the Irish, because it will mean he has continued to develop at a rapid rate. If it is Buchner, however, well then all things are going according to plan.

“‘We are trying to build something toward the future,” Rees said in April. “That’s where our focus has been with Tyler.’”

2022 OUTLOOK

First, do not sprain an ankle walking down the stairs again. Maybe do not take phone calls while walking down the stairs. Doing so cost Buchner the 2022 Blue-Gold Game. He certainly would have played if the game had been more than an exhibition, but the brief scare still underscores the concerns of leaning on a mobile quarterback.

Buchner will be exposed to hits in 2022. He will seek out some of them.

that’s a backup qb pressing the hit stick on a defender pic.twitter.com/zTFwuRMt25 — mike taddow (@MikeTaddow) November 28, 2021

If Buchner stays healthy, he should be Notre Dame’s starting quarterback throughout the season. A rash of interceptions a la that Virginia Tech showing could force Pyne into action, but the only defenses that should strike genuine fear into Buchner are also the games in which his big-play potential will be most vital. (Ohio State, BYU, Clemson. Something could also be said for Cal’s traditionally stout defense, but that offense should be so woeful, the Irish defense might outscore it.)

Furthermore, Freeman’s primary offensive input this spring was to preach against turnovers, only natural given a former defensive coordinator knows how much a focus they are on the other side of the ball. Presuming that harping got through to Buchner this spring, he should keep Notre Dame largely on task this fall.

There will be mistakes. He has not seen enough live action to think otherwise. If he averages an interception per game, the question will be if he can produce twice that in touchdowns, passing and rushing combined.

That may seem a low bar, but frame Buchner’s success around the Irish offense’s success. If he scores twice per game, and a running back gets into the end zone once each week — let’s add two field goals for modest measure — that is a quick 27 points per game. Last year’s relatively high-scoring offense averaged 35.2 points per game, and this exercise got nearly within a touchdown of that while asking for the bare minimum from Buchner and discounting any defensive scoring.

That is all to say Notre Dame will not need Buchner to be a world-beater. If he succeeds twice as often as he fails, the Irish should be in good position. Anything worse than that, though, and Notre Dame will have reason to fret both in 2022 and moving forward.

DOWN THE ROAD

If Buchner achieves that modest suggestion, then he will start in 2023 with hefty expectations heaped upon him. A modestly successful sophomore season for an Irish starting quarterback would inevitably lead to Heisman conversations next August.

Such is the yoke carried by that specific position.

It would be undue hype, most likely a year early.

Perhaps that is the way to view Buchner: He hardly started at quarterback in high school. He played a specific sparkplug role as a freshman. He should strike a balance between dynamic and serviceable in his first season as a collegiate starter. That gradual progress would lead to a breakout in 2024.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A junior, Botelho has three seasons of eligibility remaining thanks to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver rendering his debut season a mulligan for these purposes.

Depth Chart: Botelho spent much of the spring working at Rover (increasingly referred to as the Sniper) rather than at defensive end. That was at least in part because senior Isaiah Foskey and fifth-year Justin Ademilola create quite the tandem at Vyper end, but Botelho is still too dynamic to not get onto the field somewhere. At Rover, he likely backs up senior Jack Kiser, subbing in for Kiser in specific situations, perhaps against jumbo packages and on certain third-and-longs.

Recruiting: An All-American and consensus four-star, Botelho made an early decision in picking Notre Dame over public frontrunner Washington. The No. 11 inside linebacker and No. 176 overall prospect in the class, per rivals.com, Botelho ended up not playing in the All-American Bowl due to an October 2019 incident highlighted by some punches thrown outside of a volleyball state championship. The Irish stuck by Botelho’s scholarship in that moment, something that cannot always be assumed in such situations.

CAREER TO DATE

Few players on Notre Dame’s roster have been discussed as much with as little production to follow as Botelho. That is as much a commentary on the public echo chamber as it is on Botelho’s career, if not more so.

He took 18 defensive snaps in 2020, making his biggest contributions on special teams, including two disrupted punts against South Florida.

Botelho took 126 snaps in 2021, still not a defensive regular and perhaps most notable against Stanford as the Irish leaned into a bigger defensive package to combat the Cardinal’s offensive size. He made four tackles against Stanford, the third game in a row in which he made four tackles, but then logged only one in the Fiesta Bowl.

That yo-yo nature has been the most consistent part of Botelho’s early career. An early enrollee in 2020, the pandemic cost him the expected advantages of that arrival. When the football team returned to campus that June, Botelho was soon sent home by the coaching staff for a collection of frustrations. In time, he opted to return and fight through that adversity, a credit to him, but the entire situation encapsulates what about Botelho has led to so much consternation from the outside.

QUOTES

New defensive coordinators tend to say similar things about Botelho. Consider Marcus Freeman last year:

“The thing with Jordan is you have to try to control his emotion. He’s an emotional guy. The same things that make you love him, the emotion he plays with, are the same things you’ve got to make sure you keep under control.”

And now consider new Irish defensive coordinator Al Golden this spring:

“We’ve just got to get him to play with a little more poise. He wants to chase, chase, chase and do all that. He’s just got to relax a little bit and let his natural talent come out. … I really like his progress. I’m going to keep working with him to try to get him to slow down a little bit and then let him speed his game up because he’s playing with more poise.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Botelho will disrupt opposing defenses this season — as well as their punters, but that will no longer be his greatest effect. Foskey remains the better defensive end, but with Freeman utilizing the Vyper end in coverage, as well, Botelho’s skill set may be more applicable than the usual back up’s.

“A season with 150-200 defensive snaps, a handful of tackles for loss and a few sacks should be the bare minimum for Botelho. Add in a few pass breakups and that will be a clear sign that Freeman’s multiple-front scheme is confounding opposing quarterbacks as designed.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

More of a role. If measuring by snap count — a faulty metric in that one can expect the Irish offense to work a bit slower in 2022 due to its lack of healthy skill position players, and in effect reduce the total plays in a game — then cracking the 200 mark will mean Botelho is firmly in the defensive rotation, not just a piece on a game-by-game basis.

Botelho playing as the fourth linebacker against Wisconsin and Stanford last season may have been the indicator of what is to come. Notre Dame trusts his physicality against almost anyone, but his speed allows him to work on the defensive second level. That role could be trotted out again in October against BYU and Stanford.

But if that is it, Botelho will not make enough of an impact in 2022 to engender future optimism.

Kiser will be the primary Rover for the Irish. His knack for finding the ball is too enjoyable to think Botelho’s dynamism will trump it. But Botelho is more physical than Kiser.

The fact that Botelho’s physicality is the item repeatedly mentioned here can be taken as a sign of lazy writing or as an intended emphasis. It is the piece that sets him apart, in both good ways and bad. If Golden and Notre Dame find literal and figurative methods to routinely harness it, the defense could find a wrinkle that opposing offenses have no way around. If not, Botelho may peak in early October and be an afterthought by the season’s end in Los Angeles.

DOWN THE ROAD

Botelho is not too small to work at Vyper end, and when Foskey and Ademilola depart after this season, he may move back up to that initial position. His speed makes the Rover fit understandable, but his innate desire to put his head down and charge forward obviously fits better at defensive end.

This is a larger pondering than Golden will want to consider in-season, but it will absolutely determine Botelho’s trajectory entering 2023. Kiser will still be Notre Dame’s starting Rover, so the most playing time will be available if the Hawaiian can become the starting Vyper.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Powlus has all four seasons of eligibility remaining after not appearing in a game in 2021.

Depth Chart: Three quarterbacks would have to suffer injuries for Powlus to find his way into meaningful snaps this season, which is to say, early-enrolled freshman Steve Angeli is already definitively ahead of Powlus on the Notre Dame depth chart.

Recruiting: Powlus was somewhat of a Signing Day surprise, at least from outside the Irish program. Two MAC schools, Yale and Kentucky had offered him a scholarship, and apparently, Notre Dame had quietly, as well, before December 2020. Admittedly, a knee injury in his junior season in 2019 curtailed some of Powlus’ recruitment, momentum he could not reignite thanks to the pandemic.

QUOTES

Awareness and honesty are vital qualities, in both coaches and players. When then-recruiting coordinator Brian Polian discussed Powlus’ signing in the early signing period in 2020, he did not try to oversell the two- or three-star recruit.

“Powlus’ ceiling may be a solid career backup who can manage a game if the starter is out, and that’s nothing to scoff at,” Polian said. “If you change his last name and put him in a random state, I doubt he lands a Notre Dame offer, but if he is someone that will stick around the program for the long haul, then that is important at quarterback, a position that regularly has transfers.”

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

The first week of December is but a distant memory by now, but as the season rapidly approaches, it is worth remembering some of the events that turned Notre Dame into a public darling, rare territory for the Irish. Powlus and the rest of the quarterbacks publicly politicking for offensive coordinator Tommy Rees and a pay raise remains one of the more absurd and delightful moments in recent history. Of course, Rees leaned into it.

On a more serious note, players finding their voices leads to other genuinely good things.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“The irony of using Powlus to bolster the quarterbacks room is he has also been “snake-bitten” the last few seasons, to use Polian’s description. A shoulder injury cost Powlus his junior year, and then the pandemic made things rather murky throughout his senior season, though he still led Penn High School to the state playoffs.

“So Powlus will also need to reacclimate himself a bit to football in 2021. He should have plenty of time to do so, since Wisconsin transfer Jack Coan joining the room knocks Powlus down to the fifth quarterback on the depth chart, though perhaps fourth among those healthy.

“At most, Powlus will have scout team duties. …

“The cynical view of pulling in a staffer’s son (former Irish quarterback Ron Powlus, a multi-year starter in the 1990s, works as an associate athletic director at Notre Dame) when the NCAA gives a pass on scholarship maximums will be tested in years to come. If Powlus hangs around, then that view will be rendered as inaccurate as it is pessimistic.

“If Powlus transfers to a mid-tier MAC school, though, then this could end up a win-win. Notre Dame gets depth and maturity in the program, and Powlus has a chance to develop to continue his playing career.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Powlus taking the field on a Saturday this fall will mean one of three things.

1) At least two of sophomore Tyler Buchner, junior Drew Pyne and freshman Steve Angeli have suffered long-term injuries.

2) One of Buchner or Pyne suffered a long-term injury, yet the Irish still blow out nearly every unranked opponent. With a chance to still preserve a year of eligibility for Angeli, Powlus takes over mop-up duty in the fifth such rout, perhaps against Syracuse at the end of October.

3) Angeli has suffered an injury, but a blowout has gotten too ugly to continue to play Pyne. Powlus represents a form of sportsmanship not too far removed from Red Auerbach lighting a cigar on the bench.

Not to be too harsh toward Powlus, but none of those are good situations for Notre Dame, even if one of them hinges on nearly half a dozen 30-point wins.

Instead, Powlus should continue to helm the Irish scout team while providing stability in the quarterbacks room.

DOWN THE ROAD

The mere fact that Powlus is still on the roster lends some credible skepticism to the year-ago thought that his scholarship was solely a pandemic-induced gift. Notre Dame now has three healthy quarterbacks and no scholarships to throw around. If Powlus had been a filler while scholarship maximums were in flux, his clock would have run out. By now

Thus, expect Powlus to represent calm in the constantly-transitioning quarterback through at least the 2023 season. Once graduated, either in 2023 or 2024, Powlus could head to a low-level Group of Five program or perhaps an FCS school to conclude his career.

The former possibility may sound overly ambitious, but after three seasons working in South Bend, Powlus may have more of an immediate ceiling than the recruits such programs would sign, and he would have an entire Irish coaching staff vouching for him.

As one example — not a prediction, just one example — Georgia Southern brought in transfers from Buffalo and Troy this offseason as it tries to transition from an option offense to a more up-tempo approach. Clay Helton — yes, former USC head coach Clay Helton — has his work cut out for him and Will Likely be looking for quarterbacks and receivers wherever he can find them for a couple years.

Could Helton’s former running backs coach reach out with a suggestion down the line? Deland McCullough will certainly be watching the Irish backfield plenty the next two seasons.

Obviously that exact scenario is unlikely, but it is hardly beyond the realm of possibility.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A junior, Henderson has three seasons of eligibility remaining thanks to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver granting him exactly one extra game in 2020.

Depth Chart: Notre Dame has five safeties competing for two starting spots. More precisely, the Irish have four safeties competing to start alongside Northwestern transfer and preseason All-American Brandon Joseph. Henderson is very much in that mix, mostly joined by fifth-year veterans DJ Brown and Houston Griffith, with junior Xavier Watts representing a more physical approach for certain situations.

Recruiting: Henderson waited until December’s signing period to choose Notre Dame over Utah with Tennessee, Washington and Oklahoma also giving chase. While recruiting rankings may have considered Henderson a three-star prospect, any defensive back pursued by the Huskies deserves the benefit of the doubt.

CAREER TO DATE

Henderson appeared on special teams in five games in 2020, a number that would usually be viewed as an absolute waste of a year of eligibility, but in that specific season, the fifth game had no effect on Henderson’s future.

He had arrived in South Bend looking to play cornerback after spending much of his high school career at receiver. That led to a natural adjustment period, one then turned on its head when he moved to safety halfway through the 2021 season. Once Henderson made that move, he took over as a starter and helped Notre Dame survive the loss of All-American Kyle Hamilton (until the Fiesta Bowl’s second half).

2020: 5 games.

2021: 13 games, 4 starts; 14 tackles with half of one for loss and one interception along with one pass broken up.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

QUOTES

Henderson learned he would move to safety a day later than the rest of the team. He was sick the Monday before Notre Dame went to Virginia, thus missing the initial install that the rest of the Irish studied. He learned Tuesday, and his whirlwind week found stability late Thursday when his mother reminded him safety is not all that different from cornerback.

“I told her what’s going on, and she told me, be calm, be confident in myself,” Henderson said. “I’ve been doing this for a long time, playing football since I was seven, so at the end of the day, it’s just playing football.”

That calm may have paid off then, but it pales in comparison to the steadiness brought by a full winter and spring of working at safety.

“Playing helped me gain more confidence in myself,” Henderson said this spring. “The confidence was always there, but I can see more self-reliant on myself. I never doubted myself. …

“[Playing was] key. It gives me a little bit more experience.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“That 6-foot-3 recruiting listing was clearly embellished, but it can be thought of as illustrative of Henderson’s wingspan. He is a long 6-foot-1 and a fast 6-foot-1. Anyone able to crack 10.6 seconds in the 100-meter dash warrants notice as a speed threat, and combining that with his length should give Henderson more defensive opportunities this season.

“But his most likely contributions will come on special teams. Special teams coordinator Brian Polian needs to revamp most of his units simply due to roster churn, and Henderson’s profile would fit well on punt and kickoff coverages.

“Backing up (Cam) Hart will eventually lead to at least a few series of work for Henderson, at the absolute least, be it via a tough hit or getting burned on an off day. These are the tribulations of all cornerbacks, and why depth there is so vital.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Henderson played more than Brown to close the season, something that suggests he could do so early this year, as well. If so, Henderson may suddenly be a starter.

His speed and overall athleticism shined in his opportunities last year, leading to some subtle summer buzz. That buzz may yield little, but it is something that has not often accompanied Notre Dame’s safeties.

Regardless of if he starts, Henderson will find his way into the defensive rotation. He was projected as a nickel back entering last season, and per Brian Kelly, Henderson spent most of the season practicing at nickel back. If fifth-year nickel back Tariq Bracy is played off the field for the fourth time in his five years, then perhaps Henderson will move into that need. If not, he should still be a prime candidate to round out the Irish dime package.

New defensive coordinator Al Golden may be a linebackers coach at heart, and his best defensive unit is unquestionably the defensive line, but his safeties could be the pieces that turn Notre Dame’s defense from good to great. The Irish have cornerback worries, both in depth and quality, but they have an abundance of safeties. At least three of which — Joseph, Griffith and Henderson — have spent time at cornerback.

The coverage possibilities among that group should compensate for those cornerback concerns. Henderson will play a role in that, albeit one yet uncertain.

DOWN THE ROAD

Joseph, Griffith and Brown should all be gone in 2023. Notre Dame is recruiting impressive safeties in the class of 2023, with two committed already, but Henderson looks earmarked to be a starter next season, as well as in 2024 if he is still in South Bend.

For a high school receiver that did not move to safety until the back half of his sophomore season, becoming a multi-year starter is quite the ascension, especially if “multi-” ends up meaning “three-” in this instance.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A junior, Pyne still has all four seasons of eligibility remaining. Obviously, the 2020 season did not count against his eligibility clock, not that it would have anyway since he played in only four games, and then Notre Dame judiciously used him in only two games last season, preserving another season of play down the line.

Depth Chart: Pyne will back up sophomore Tyler Buchner at Ohio State in 37 days. Ignore any talk in preseason practices of a quarterback competition, even if it is used in headlines.

Recruiting: An Under Armour All-American and consensus four-star prospect, Pyne’s offer sheet may be a better indicator of his talent than even those accolades, an indicator that may help explain why Notre Dame catered to his eligibility last season.

As the No. 7 pro-style quarterback in the class of 2020 and No. 118 overall recruit, per rivals.com, Pyne chose the Irish over Alabama, LSU and Michigan.

CAREER TO DATE

With Brendon Clark injured, Pyne rose to No. 2 quarterback as a freshman, backing up Ian Book as Notre Dame found its way to the College Football Playoff. Pyne played in four games, logging stats in only two: a 52-0 blowout of South Florida and the Playoff semifinal loss to Alabama.

He entered 2021 back in the No. 2 spot, thanks to Jack Coan’s graduate transfer from Wisconsin. When Coan suffered an injury against the Badgers, Pyne stepped in to lead a touchdown drive that could have been remembered as absolutely pivotal if not for the fourth-quarter defensive onslaught unleashed by the Irish.

Memorably, Pyne pointed to Coan as a motivating factor when he joined the huddle after Coan’s injury, underscoring both their strong relationship and the personal nature of the game for Coan.

The opening seconds of this poke a bit of a hole in any claims Jack Coan, and #NotreDame on his behalf, did not want to get this win a bit more than usual.

And then later, Drew Pyne saying, ""Look at Jack. Let's go punch one in for him."" https://t.co/xFSYacusNC — Douglas Farmer (@D_Farmer) September 27, 2021

Pyne then played in the second half of Notre Dame’s loss to Cincinnati, replacing Coan as the Irish offense stagnated. Alas, that spark was too little, too late.

2020: 4 games; 2-of-3 passing for 12 yards. One rush for four yards.

2021: 2 games; 15-of-30 passing for 224 yards and two touchdowns. Six rushes for a loss of six yards.

QUOTES

Both Pyne and Buchner excelled in not saying much when they were meeting with the media this spring. That is meant as a compliment, as this space subscribes to Crash Davis’ feelings about young players and the important usage of clichés early in their careers, even if it comes at the expense of juicy narratives and excess clicks.

But two notes tied to offensive assistant coaches can illustrate the spring put forth by Pyne.

First of all, he focused on every detail of his game, repeatedly insisting he tries to work on everything, not just his weaknesses. Improving his strengths adds value, too. It is unclear if his exact understanding of the design of an inside-outside zone run play was a weakness or a strength, but that is how far into the nitty-gritty Pyne delves.

“I was in here with [offensive line coach Harry] Hiestand yesterday for an hour and a half going through just simple inside-outside zone just with the line,” Pyne said in mid-March.

The one area of his game that is a weakness for all quarterbacks is turnovers. Pyne did not throw an interception last season, but he then threw two interceptions in the Blue-Gold Game, with a third invalidated by penalty. Fortunately for Pyne and Buchner, their offensive coordinator is well aware of how vital it is to avoid turnovers.

“I know how critical it is through my own mistakes,” Tommy Rees said this spring in a moment of self-deprecation.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Coan will start in Tallahassee, but Pyne presents a viable option should Coan struggle at any point this season. Presenting failure as the necessity to spur a quarterback controversy is not the vibe anyone is looking for heading into a season, but that may be what it takes for Pyne to usurp Coan this season.

“That is not a knock on Pyne. It is the obvious reality of the Irish seeking out a graduate transfer even before the NCAA approved the one-time transfer rule this spring. They wanted someone proven to raise the floor on the 2021 season, and Coan represents that.

“But even with those odds stacked against Pyne, he will once again be one play away from taking over at all times, and that duty is needed more years than not. …

“The odds will be stacked against Pyne again in 2022, with broad expectations of current freshman Tyler Buchner taking over after Coan. Buchner is the more heralded recruit, but he also hasn’t played since 2019 and by no means was Pyne a meager prospect, as outlined above.

“They will both have their chance in the spring of 2022, and that should be an enjoyable quarterback competition, unlike the current nominal one.”

2022 OUTLOOK

As badly as Pyne played in the spring finale — 22-of-33 for 185 yards, a 5.61 yards per pass attempt average — the deck was somewhat stacked against him. With Buchner sidelined by a sprained ankle, Pyne played for both the Blue team and the Gold team, all while wearing a red jersey.

The red jersey is obviously intended to protect a quarterback, but it can also cut into the options available to him. Early-enrolled freshman Steve Angeli was able to dive for the pylon to win the game only because he was not wearing red. If he had been, there would have been an expectation he remain in the pocket or at least close to it, and the defense would have certainly tagged him down before that full extension to the goal line.

Pyne is not as much a running quarterback as Buchner, but his ability to get outside the pocket aids his passing. Without that, he was forced into some passes he may not have otherwise thrown. Now his interceptions were more simply terrible throws, but the general struggles were not entirely as bad as they seemed on the surface.

Nonetheless, they all but sealed that this quarterback competition is not genuinely an ongoing one. If Pyne had starred in that moment, Rees would have had to ponder his options all summer. Instead, Pyne put on tape the reasons he likely will not be called upon for game-in, game-out showings.

As a backup, Pyne’s mobility and figuratively-grounded approach bode well. They provide a change of pace that forces a defense to recalibrate, and that alone gives the offense a moment to breathe while the starter recovers or the gameplan adjusts.

Those same tricks do not apply as a starter.

Pyne will be needed to spell Buchner at some point. After all, the sophomore sprained his ankle walking down the stairs while on the phone this spring. That moment may be needed to win a game, a la Wisconsin last year.

DOWN THE ROAD

Notre Dame not playing Pyne in more games last season suggests a broad understanding of what his future likely holds. With Buchner presumed the Irish starter for the next two or three seasons, Pyne will need to find somewhere else to get a thorough shot at playing time.

By preserving a year of eligibility last season, the Notre Dame coaching staff saved one for Pyne’s next stop, theoretically making him a more desirable prospect to other coaching staffs. Do not scoff at that thought process; it was a generous one by the Irish coaches, although not a completely altruistic one as appeasing the best interests of the player engenders goodwill in the locker room and cuts down on the chances of an early transfer by the player in question.

Pyne will graduate at some point either this December, this May or next December. (This space is not going to speculate on his class load without explicit knowledge of it.) With a diploma in hand, he could conceivably transfer to a program needing a quarterback with two or three seasons left to play.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Kollie has three seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Kollie spent most of the spring working at Will (weakside) linebacker behind senior Marist Liufau. Notre Dame has an effective two-deep across the board at linebacker, but no proven depth behind them, so any injury among those six players Will Likely add stress to the other five, regardless of position.

Recruiting: Pivotal moments of recruiting can be lost to time; the final steps of Kollie’s should not be. An Under Armour All-American and consensus four-star, Kollie began to waver in his commitment to Notre Dame just two days before the early signing period when then-defensive coordinator Clark Lea took the head coaching job at Vanderbilt. Alabama, Georgia and LSU had all long chased Kollie, and the uncertainty of Lea’s departure brought those possibilities back to the forefront of Kollie’s mind.

Lea was actually the one to steady Kollie’s commitment, reassuring the Tennessee star and Butkus Award winner that Notre Dame was the best fit for him even as Lea left.

CAREER TO DATE

Most of Kollie’s work in his debut campaign came on special teams, only dabbling in actual defensive moments, most notably in blowouts of Navy, Virginia and Georgia Tech.

2021: 10 games; 14 tackles.

Editor’s Note: That impressive photo atop this article is indeed of Kollie. He changed his uniform number this year to No. 10 from No. 32.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Notre Dame may put Kollie into genuinely competitive moments. He already has a frame to hold up at the next level, and Kollie has always relished the physical nature of the game.

“The Irish may first break in Kollie with work on the special teams coverage units, but making a few tackles there would only strengthen the likelihood of picking up some of (Jack) Kiser’s workload.

“Kollie is poised to be the next in line among “great Notre Dame linebackers,” as made clear by mentioning the last few above. But the next next is also possibly already committed. …

“The Irish not only have four consensus four-star linebackers pledged in the current cycle, but one of them is clearly a natural Rover, Jaylen Sneed.

“The two will man Notre Dame’s outside linebacker positions for years to come, beginning in perhaps 2023. But one will move from the supposedly ideal fit at Rover to Will (weakside) linebacker.

“That could be looked at as a sacrifice, or as a step toward an even more multiple defense, something Freeman already prefers.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Kollie’s 2021 was somewhat truncated by a case of COVID in September, setting him back in his progress toward the defensive rotation. The result was taking only 58 defensive snaps in the season, most of them in routs.

There is obviously no way to know how much Kollie would have contributed if not for that setback, but it is safe to presume he would have been more physically ready as the year went along. Rather than JD Bertrand needing to play through a wrist injury that long-required surgery, the Irish could have had some semblance of linebacker depth.

Consider that the rough baseline for 2022: Provide depth.

Liufau is returning from injury, but by all indications is thoroughly 100 percent. That will also help the depth, but if his backup is not ready, that will eventually compromise Liufau.

A genuine backup role could include 20-30 snaps per game, topping Kollie’s entire 2021 showing in as few as two weeks. That will also lead to 20 or so tackles in the season.

Those may seem like modest benchmarks, particularly for such a highly-touted recruit, but Notre Dame is currently blessed with a couple dynamic linebackers, thus keeping the youth movement on the second line of the two-deep.

DOWN THE ROAD

Liufau could have as many as three seasons of eligibility remaining, the same as Kollie. The same is true of senior Jack Kiser at Rover and even Bertrand at middle linebacker.

But sixth years should be expected less and less as the 2020 universal pandemic eligibility waiver falls further into the proverbial rearview mirror. At Notre Dame, that may be even more true as Marcus Freeman so aggressively recruits elite talent, landing a quartet of four-star linebackers last year and already adding another committed pair in the class of 2023.

As Liufau, Kiser and Bertrand matriculate out of the program after either this season or next, Kollie should be expected to step into a primary role before those current freshmen. Even when his debut season got off to a rocky start, through no fault of his own, Kollie played in 10 games. The Irish coaches clearly thought he had a college-ready physique and will not need five (injury-free) years to make his impact felt.

2022-23 year, eligibility: An incoming freshman, Raridon has four seasons of eligibility remaining, and five years to use them.

Depth Chart: Given a torn ACL in 2021, assume Raridon is the last of Notre Dame’s six tight ends to see playing time in 2022.

Recruiting: The No. 5 tight end in the class of 2022 and No. 198 overall prospect, per rivals.com, Raridon was chased by most of the Big Ten, most notably both his homestate powers, Iowa and Iowa State. Nonetheless, he committed to the Irish in early May a year ago, and that pledge was never in doubt.

The reality is, neither the Hawkeyes nor the Cyclones ever had much of a chance, since Raridon has been around Notre Dame since his toddler days. His father, Scott, was an Irish offensive lineman from 2002 to 2005. Go ahead, do the math.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Raridon is a better football player than a basketball player, but he was plenty accomplished in the latter in high school. There may not be a distinct NIL opportunity tied to that, but it still warrants recognition and, if nothing else, is yet another endorsement of playing multiple sports in high school rather than hyper-focusing on just one.

Watch these highlights and focus on No. 44. You’ll see a comfort level on the hardwood, an ease getting above the rim and an understanding of how to use his unique physical assets. Raridon’s left hand could have used some work, often finishing with his right when his left would have been the better choice, and there is an apparent lack of a jump shot in these highlights, but those are the reasons he is playing football at the next level.

QUOTES

One way or another, Notre Dame would have noticed Raridon. The family ties are too deep. But the recruitment was made easier by how few other programs noticed him early on in high school.

“COVID probably did us a favor on that one because people couldn’t see him live,” Irish offensive coordinator Tommy Rees said when Raridon signed his National Letter of Intent in December. “To be honest with you, the difference-maker for him was when we turned on his basketball film a year ago.

“It’s like, wow, this guy’s athleticism, pun intended, jumps out of the room. He’s someone you get around, see him in-person for the first time, you see the length, you see his athletic ability. To me, the sky is the limit for his potential. He’s someone that we’re extremely excited about. He was very under-recruited for a lot of reasons, and I think of late, he’s gotten the notoriety he deserves.”

Raridon tore his ACL three days later, for timing context.

WHAT WAS SAID WHEN RARIDON SIGNED IN DECEMBER

“Raridon looks like a downfield tight end more than an in-line blocker, his 6-foot-6 frame as used to dunking a basketball as leaping for a pass. …

“Praise is going to follow Raridon and follow him soon. If he adds muscle to that lanky frame, his ceiling could fit right in with some of the bigger names to come through “Tight End U.” Raridon’s speed shines in the seam route that Irish offensive coordinator Tommy Rees has long adored both as a quarterback and as a play caller. File that thought away now.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Raridon is optimistic he will be able to play in 2022. He should be. That is the luxury of youth. Yet, it is rather unlikely.

“Seven and a half months from the surgery is fall camp, and that’s when I’m going to be ready to go,” he said to Inside ND Sports this month. “But I’m hoping by the time I get there June 10, I’ll be able to do everything summer workouts-wise.

“If we were doing pads during the summer, I probably would sit out until late July or beginning of August. We’re not doing any of that from what I know, which is good. So I think I’m going to be good to go. We’ll see what happens, but I’m feeling really good about it.”

The most aggressive timetables for returning from an ACL tear are about nine months. Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson set that new threshold in 2012, and it has increasingly become more common, which is to say, it is still rather uncommon.

Nine months from Raridon’s injury will be mid-September.

If Notre Dame lacked proven tight ends, perhaps there would be an argument for Raridon to ease into the rotation by midseason, but this is “Tight End U,” and the Irish currently enjoy the services of perhaps the best tight end in program history. Even behind Michael Mayer, sophomore Mitchell Evans has impressed many, and then junior Kevin Bauman or sophomore Cane Berrong will be ready as the third option, both coming off their own leg injuries in 2021.

There is no need to rush Raridon into that grouping. A full and prolonged recovery will be the smarter long-term play, and it should absolutely be the expectation for Raridon, despite his natural optimism.

DOWN THE ROAD

There is no version of this world in which Mayer is not a 2023 NFL draft pick. Even if he suffers some injury this season, Mayer would not fall lower than the second or third round, and that itself would be a shock.

Notre Dame will need a new lead tight end in 2023, and it could be Raridon.

His height, body control and soft hands make him the ideal tight end for a modern offense. More and more, the best tight ends are barely distinguishable from the receivers the Irish like to play along the boundary. Think of Miles Boykin and Chase Claypool. They were listed at 6-foot-4, 228 pounds, and 6-foot-4 ⅜, 229 pounds, respectively, in their final collegiate seasons. Raridon has them both beat in height, but he is at a similar weight. If he adds a touch of muscle, he will very much evoke those types of targets.

Notre Dame has other options, and given their recruiting pedigrees, any one of Evans, Buaman or Berrong could erupt and be the next Irish tight end drafted in the first round (after Mayer). But Raridon’s game fits the modern ideals. Once he is healthy, he may need to be reckoned with.

WHY NO. 89?

Editor’s Note: The original version of this story was published before Notre Dame announced Raridon would wear No. 9 this season. That version guessed at his jersey number.

Raridon wore No. 88 in high school, but that is currently owned by Evans. And this is one position the NCAA’s strong suggestions for numbers parameters are generally followed. Generally, of course, being the operative word. After all, Tommy Tremble wore No. 24 as a tight end at Notre Dame.

But the strong suggestions prefer tight ends wear a number between 80 and 99, the latter half of those usually defensive. Given that, No. 89 would be appropriate for Raridon. Then again, No. 44 is available, and that is what he wore on the basketball court. Early-enrolled freshman linebacker Junior Tuihalamaka and sophomore long snapper Alex Peitsch both wear No. 44, creating some concerns about multiple players being on the field at the same time with the same number, but the bigger roadblock for Raridon in wanting No. 44? His tight end classmate, Holden Staes, wore No. 44 in high school.

Regardless, this is just an educated guess, designed to slot Raridon among the tight ends he will soon compete with and against.

2022-23 year, eligibility: By the letter of current NCAA eligibility rules, Ademilola has two seasons remaining despite being a fifth-year veteran in 2022. He preserved a year of eligibility via traditional measures as a freshman, playing in four carefully-selected games, and then his full season in 2020 did not count toward his eligibility clock due to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver. To put all that another way, Ademilola could theoretically return to Notre Dame in 2023.

He will also play plenty at “Big” end, but the emergence of junior Rylie Mills has turned Ademilola into the swingman between the two positions.

Recruiting: A consensus three-star prospect and the No. 34 strongside defensive end in the class, per rivals.com, the schools chasing Ademilola recognized something the recruiting industry did not. When Clemson, Alabama and Miami offered him a scholarship, the general skepticism was that the offers came as an inducement for his twin brother, defensive tackle Jayson, a much higher-rated recruit.

That was the perception. Given Justin’s first impressions in 2018 — exceedingly positive — and his gradual but consistent development, it would seem by now that perception was flawed, and the schools knew what they might get in the lighter twin.

CAREER TO DATE

The first indication Ademilola would be more than merely part of a package deal came when Notre Dame measured his four games in 2018 to have him available — without losing eligibility — in the College Football Playoff, and in many respects, Ademilola was one of the few Irish players who looked like he belonged on the field against Clemson that afternoon.

He backed up both Khalid Kareem and Ade Ogundeji in 2019 and then Ogundeji yet in 2020, future NFL players who should start in front of a developing prospect, and then he worked in tandem with Myron Tagovailoa-Amosa last season, though Tagovailoa-Amosa was the official starter throughout the season, again a future NFL player.

2018: 4 games; 9 tackles.

2019: 8 games; 9 tackles with one for loss.

2020: 12 games; 17 tackles with 2.5 for loss including one sack.

2021: 13 games; 35 tackles with six for loss including five sacks and one forced fumble.

QUOTES

Few teams can boast three better defensive linemen than Foskey and the Ademilola twins. Foskey and Jayson Ademilola, in particular, should be early- to mid-round draft picks, absolutely no lower. A strong season from Justin could ignite some NFL draft conversation around him, too.

For most of the spring, they were referred to as a collective, and that will continue this fall, even when the person talking is one of them.

“The decision to return with my brother and Isaiah to come back was great,” Jayson said in January. “The excitement I have for next season is at an all-time high, just knowing that the guys in the room, we love to go at it. We love to get after the football, we love the game.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“While Tagovailoa-Amosa did not switch positions as a graduate student to do anything but start and improve his NFL stock, Ademilola has shown too much to be relegated to simple backup status. His 35 career tackles undersell how much Ademilola has consistently held his own as Notre Dame’s bigger end.

“He took 233 snaps in 2020, a number that should cross 300 this year and perhaps near 350. At that point, Ademilola and Tagovailoa-Amosa would genuinely be splitting reps, with any starting defender taking more than 600 snaps considered a full-time player.

“Rather than look at pure tackle numbers, though, Ademilola’s success should be gauged through tackles for loss. As well as he has played in his three years, finding the ball carrier in the backfield only 3.5 times is not enough. The Irish will look for him to reach that number in 2021 alone, if not get to five or six tackles for loss.

“If Ademilola can do that, and then Tagovailoa-Amosa amass an equal number, suddenly Notre Dame’s more physical end position will be more than serviceable, if not back to the standard Kareem set when he made 10.5 tackles for loss on his own in 2018 or when he and Ogundeji combined for 17 in 2019.

“It would be rash to predict such lofty numbers from the present duo, partly because of an honest acknowledgment of talent differentials and partly because new Irish defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman may use three-man fronts in certain situations, perhaps diminishing the chances for Ademilola to wreak havoc.

“But 5-6 tackles for loss would suggest Freeman still enjoys a potent defensive line, one that may have been part of the reason he joined Notre Dame despite overtures from across the country this offseason.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Do not be fooled by Ademilola’s backup status. As a bit more distinct of a backup last year, he still took 445 snaps. Ademilola gets on the field. In that respect, this is becoming a common theme for the Irish defensive front-seven. Junior Jordan Botelho is too intriguing of a player to be relegated to the third-string, which he would be at Vyper end thanks to Ademilola, so Botelho moved to Rover this spring.

Similarly, Ademilola will split time between Vyper and Big ends so as to make sure Mills sees the appropriate amount of action.

To give 445 snaps some context, Notre Dame defended 888 plays last year.

Thus, it may be tough for Ademilola to see significantly more action. If he, Foskey and Mills form a perfect three-for-two rotation, then each would see close to 600 plays, but that math ignores blowouts and different defensive alignments. Ademilola may top out at 500 snaps.

But look at his career progression in a statistical manner. Each season, Ademilola improves and adds to his impact. From nine tackles in 2019 to 17 in 2020 to 35 last year. From one tackle for loss in 2019 to 2.5 in 2020 to six last year. He simply keeps getting better.

Apply that likelihood to a slightly larger role, and Ademilola could approach double-digit sacks in 2022. As the third defensive end, that would be an absurd accomplishment. In this instance, “absurd” is not so much a reference to Ademilola as it is to the depth of the Irish defensive line.

This is the best position group on Notre Dame’s roster. That is directly a reflection of the Ademilola twins and Foskey all returning for one more season.

DOWN THE ROAD

Though perhaps Justin Ademilola opts for two more seasons. As well as Freeman has been recruiting defensive talent, there may be a bit of a vacuum at Vyper end in 2023. The most likely fix is Botelho moves back up to the defensive line, but it could also present a chance for Ademilola to start and star.

Sixth-year players should be viewed as myths until announced in the winter, but a veteran defensive lineman is the kind of possibility every coach would welcome, no matter the crunch it may present to the roster.

Ademilola’s linear statistical growth, applied through 2023, could project to a star, not bad for a player once publicly viewed as a recruiting throw-in.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A senior, Liufau still has three seasons of eligibility remaining, a phrasing that is borderline common this offseason, albeit one that still takes a moment to comprehend.

Depth Chart: Liufau will start for Notre Dame in five weeks at Ohio State. As the lead Will (weakside) linebacker, there is little proven depth behind the Hawaiian, namely only sophomore Prince Kollie.

Recruiting: A consensus three-star prospect and the No. 36 outside linebacker in the class, per rivals.com, Liufau was chased by the teams that one would expect to pursue a Hawaiian. USC, Oregon and Washington State led the way, falling short to the University in the Midwest known for its Hawaiian imports, largely courtesy of former special teams coordinator Brian Polian.

CAREER TO DATE

Liufau played in four games as a freshman, preserving a year of eligibility that then became redundant when he lost all of the 2021 season to a dislocated ankle. In 2020, Liufau made 22 tackles in 10 games, highlighted by a combined 12 tackles in the final two games of the season, a sneak peek at the ascension coming from Liufau in the following summer.

That rise very much did happen, as Liufau inspired loud whispers from Notre Dame practices of an undeniable breakout season before a dislocated ankle cost him the entire fall.

QUOTES

First-year Irish head coach Marcus Freeman’s comments about Liufau as he returned to full-go in practice this spring echo Brian Kelly’s thoughts from last preseason. First, a refresher on Kelly’s mid-August comments in 2021:

“He’s playing within himself a lot better in terms of what he’s asked to do,” Kelly said. “… Marist would tell you that he played outside the lines a lot and that was probably one of the things that he knew he had to get better at. … He’s a versatile player, he can pass rush off the edge, he can cover guys, he can play in the inside. He can do a lot of things for us.”

Now compare that to Freeman’s thoughts in mid-March:

“He’s a super versatile player,” Freeman said. “… He can play Vyper (end) if you need him to. Last year he was one of our most dominant pass rushers on third down in fall camp. He brings in energy, he brings a physical demeanor.

“Marist has to continue to improve his physical actions. You can play as hard as you can, you can bring a type of energy, but if you can’t control your body to accomplish your job, then you’re out of control. That’s the challenge for Marist.”

The biggest difference between Kelly’s remarks in 2021 and Freeman’s in 2022 is the ordering of the praise. Liufau has gone from overly-aggressive but versatile to versatile but overly-aggressive. Perhaps the best and most-recent example of such was Liufau’s interception in the Blue-Gold Game in April. Forcing the turnover came first, but then he drew a penalty for his celebration.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

Editor’s Note: As this series is always targeted to finish before Notre Dame begins preseason practices, this projection was obviously written before Liufua suffered that injury in the preseason.

“Liufau took 206 snaps in 10 games in 2020. He should see more playing time moving forward, and thus more than 25 tackles, but predicting further is difficult without having a better idea of how Freeman’s scheme will translate to South Bend. …

“Irish linebacker recruiting picked up last cycle and has only gained steam the last few months, but Liufau should have plenty of an edge on those incoming players. Whether or not (Shayne) Simon is around into 2022, Liufau should get a chance to dominate at Will linebacker before his time at Notre Dame is up.

“Of course, any Hawaiian starting at linebacker in a gold helmet will elicit certain comparisons, ones that are unnecessary and not necessarily applicable given the differences between middle and Will linebacker duties.

“But becoming another Hawaiian contributor at Notre Dame will only further strengthen that recruiting corridor jumping over the West Coast powers.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty should never be expected, but one feels rather likely coming from Liufau at Ohio State in five weeks. Depending on the circumstances, it may be hard to fault Liufau.

He was set to break out in 2021, and instead he had to struggle through watching road games from his own couch. Liufau has admitted that frustrated him immensely. Perhaps that should have been assumed, but in this case, one suspects Liufau was more aggravated than most would be.

He plays with that sense of aggravation. In front of 105,000 fans in his first chance to reclaim that break-out path, Liufau might deliver a late hit or celebrate a play a bit too exuberantly. A flag will fly.

And Notre Dame will be glad for it, simply because it means Liufau is not only back on the field but back in all ways.

He practiced before the Fiesta Bowl, and Liufau was active all spring, culminating with three tackles in the Blue-Gold Game, but nothing erases an injury from memory like a play on a fall Saturday.

Once that is in his back pocket, the sky might be Liufau’s ceiling. His flashes in 2020 — most notably at North Carolina on Black Friday as his blitzes flummoxed Sam Howell — gave an idea of what could come from Liufua when fully incorporated into the defense. He can keep up with any running back out of the backfield, he is big enough to cover tight ends, and he is dynamic enough to shoot through a gap and catch an unsuspecting quarterback.

Liufau’s season should not be measured by tackle numbers. Rather, only his moments of disruption will define how much of an impact he has. Between forcing fumbles, deflecting passes and tackles for loss, Liufua should knock the opposing offense off schedule at least a dozen times this season.

To put that vague description into context: Notre Dame defended approximately 131 possessions last season (touchdowns + turnovers + punts + failed fourth-down conversions). Knocking the opposition off schedule a dozen times would mean Liufau dramatically impacted about 10 percent of their possessions.

DOWN THE ROAD

Though not impossible, it is a bit of a stretch to anticipate Liufau heading to the NFL after 2022, even if he has been in college for four years already. NFL front offices will simply want to see more than one year of film, no matter how much of a star he might be in that one year.

Consider Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah. In his junior season, his first actually on the field, Owusu-Koramoah had 80 tackles with 13.5 for loss including 5.5 sacks. He both forced and recovered two fumbles while defending four passes. That was not enough to push him into the NFL. He needed more film.

A couple touchdowns would obviously elevate Liufau into greater consideration, but it is more likely he starts for the Irish again in 2023.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A senior, Foskey has three seasons of eligibility remaining, but there should be absolutely no thought of him returning in 2023, barring injury.

Depth Chart: Foskey will start for Notre Dame at Vyper end, the leader of a defense that will move around the defensive line to maximize his havoc-causing potential.

Recruiting: An All-American and the No. 15 weakside defensive end in the class, per rivals.com, Foskey chose the Irish over Washington and Cal. A northern California native, those finalists made sense and led to some public consternation when he did not publicly sign with Notre Dame in December of 2018. The reality was, he had signed, but he also wanted to enyoy a February moment with his high school teammates, thus keeping the official signing quiet for two months.

CAREER TO DATE

Foskey played in only four games as a freshman, somewhat surprising in retrospect simply because he has so developed. The Irish defensive line was plenty talented in 2019, so his minimal usage then makes sense still, but it is hard to think of Foskey stuck to the bench, nonetheless. Of course, he had his moments of impact, most notably blocking a punt at Stanford late in the second quarter, sparking a comeback from a 17-7 deficit.

In 2020, he began to flash what would come before long, and not just by blocking another punt and landing on it for a touchdown. He had four tackles in Notre Dame’s double-overtime upset of No. 1 Clemson, setting a career-high against the toughest competition.

He broke that career-high in the first game of 2021. The sheer force of his junior season is best encapsulated by the thoughts that his 11 sacks were the third-most in an Irish season and he finished tied for 11th in the country in sacks per game. Six of Notre Dame’s 13 forced fumbles came via Foskey’s hands, the most in the country. He forced two turnovers against Georgia Tech that both became defensive touchdowns.

2019: 4 games; 5 tackles.

2020: 12 games; 20 tackles with five or loss including 4.5 sacks.

2021: 13 games, 13 starts; 52 tackles with 12.5 for loss including 11 sacks and six forced fumbles.

QUOTES

It is the stated goal of every team. Only a few can think of it genuinely, and even they do not usually say it outright all that often. Yet it was a common line from Irish veterans this past winter.

“I feel like this team can really win a national championship,” Foskey said in January as to why he returned to Notre Dame instead of heading to the NFL.

He was not the only returning player to cite that possibility as a factor. The repeated line indicated it was a common refrain from Freeman following the Fiesta Bowl faceplant, realistic or otherwise.

“He mentioned that this is going to be a team that can really win a national championship under him,” Foskey said. “But I already knew what our potential could be and what it will be at the end of the season.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“The added responsibilities of Foskey also speak to his possible impact. Notre Dame turned the Rover position into a schematic wrinkle the last few years, a player that could be either an extra defender at the line of scrimmage or far down the field in coverage depending on what the situation called for.

“Freeman’s version of the Vyper will not be that multi-dimensional, but it will allow the Irish to adjust to offenses with nearly any personnel, and that will hinge on the player atop the depth chart at that end.

“‘We’re able to get in and out of different fronts more than we did a year ago, more than we did the last four years,’ defensive line coach Mike Elston said. ‘The other cool thing is Isaiah Foskey, we can move him all over the field now. We can put him at our Vyper position, we can play him at the boundary end position, we can play him to the field, play him inside at three-technique.’

“Becoming the proverbial straw that stirs the drink known as Notre Dame’s defensive front, Foskey may double his defensive snap count of 282 in 2020. He will certainly notch more than those 20 tackles, and could push toward double digits in sacks.

“Yet, both he and Irish special teams coordinator Brian Polian expect Foskey to remain a headache for opposing punters. …

“Foskey’s frame is already NFL ready. An all-around impressive 2021 could push him into the second round of next spring’s draft.

“There would be ample reason to pursue that, but he could also see a legitimate chance of raising that draft profile into the first round with a second full season in a starring role.

“Notre Dame would welcome Foskey back in 2022, particularly given the growing depth concerns at Vyper.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Success should not be measured by records, but Foskey’s chase of Justin Tuck’s sack records (25 career; 13.5 in a season) will be monitored all season. He came within 2.5 of the season record last year, despite not knowing what the mark even was halfway in late October. He now needs what would be a modest season (9.5) to break Tuck’s career record.

Both should be expected, and if considering just those numbers, Foskey’s impact will be distinct. In the last five years in the NFL, when offenses suffered a sack on a possession, they found the end zone only 8 percent of the time.

For this thought process, assume that number translates to college football, as well. If Foskey records 14 sacks, presumably on 14 different possessions, he will essentially have single-handedly halted 13 drives.

That includes some generalizing, but the point holds up. A sack is not as lauded as a turnover because it is not as dramatic and does not immediately boost field position by more than 10 yards, but its broader end result is much the same as a turnover.

Foskey sack 6: if there is a more impressive sack by any player in CFB last year, I haven't seen it. Starts out as 3-tech over VT RG, stunt gets him free over LT. Escape by QB, but Foskey never gives up and chases him down pic.twitter.com/9IF5tGSM0J — Jamie Uyeyama (@jamieuyeyama) May 19, 2022

Foskey will almost certainly be an Irish captain. He may crack 60 tackles as a defensive end. To put that into context, the next-highest defensive end tackle total at Notre Dame in the last five seasons was Khalid Kareem’s 46 in 2019. Forcing fumbles and interceptions will again be an underrated part of Foskey’s impact. But his sacks will be the metric that best measures his final collegiate season.

DOWN THE ROAD

Foskey received a third-round grade in draft evaluations in the winter, the NFL looking for more consistency from him week-in and week-out. Delivering that could turn Foskey into a first-round pick in 2023.

Along with Mayer, it makes sense why they were the two players starring in that uniform reveal, if not also for their acting chops.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A junior, Lewis has three seasons of eligibility remaining thanks to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver essentially ignoring his 12 games played as a freshman when it comes to this conversation.

Depth Chart: Lewis will start opposite senior Cam Hart with a pile of unknown youngsters as their backups.

Recruiting: A consensus three-star prospect and the No. 84 defensive back in the class, per rivals.com, the New Jersey-native was sought by the usual Northeast football programs, such as Temple, Rutgers and Boston College, but also by all the Power Five programs in the Virginias and chunks of the Big Ten.

CAREER TO DATE

If Lewis maximizes the usage of that universal pandemic eligibility waiver, he could end up breaking the Notre Dame record for career appearances, a record likely to be set by fifth-year linebacker Bo Bauer this year. Bauer has not missed a game in his career, having played in 51 to date. For Lewis to keep up with that pace, he’ll obviously have to enjoy similar durable fortune.

Lewis started the second half of his freshman season, replacing Tariq Bracy at field cornerback, and Lewis stuck there throughout 2021, as well.

2020: 12 games, 6 starts; 33 tackles, seven passes broken up and one forced fumble.

2021: 13 games, 13 starts; 53 tackles with two for loss including one sack, five passes broken up, one interception (at Florida State) and one forced fumble.

Lewis’ interception came simply via being at the right place at the right time; Kyle Hamilton broke up a pass and the carom went directly to Lewis, who alertly snagged the ball as it soared over his helmet. (The fourth slide in the below Instagram post.)

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Notre Dame’s football program continuing to provide players with highlight clips from practices and even offseason workouts is a savvy move by the Irish, recognizing the importance of content for players’ personal social media accounts and helping buoy those platforms.

It also provides a look at Lewis this offseason, and — anecdotally — he certainly appears to be adding strength to his frame.

QUOTES

Lewis, along with the entirety of the Notre Dame secondary, was exposed in the second half of the Fiesta Bowl faceplant. Oklahoma State receiver Tay Martin found the end zone twice with Lewis in coverage.

Such is the life at cornerback. A bad afternoon turns into a horrid memory within just a few snaps.

And strong cornerbacks move on, as Irish cornerbacks coach Mike Mickens thinks Lewis has.

“Clarence is a confident kid,” Mickens said in April. “He doesn’t overly talk too much, but he’s very competitive. You can just tell by the way he goes to work every day, the way he grinds.

“Whether it’s the weight room or on the field, conditioning, it doesn’t matter what it is, he’s a competitive kid.

“I’m sure he took it personally and he’s back to it again. That’s what we want.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Raising the bar on Lewis’s impressive freshman year may seem ambitious, but the pandemic plays a role in the thought. For the most part, Notre Dame struggled to bring along new players and new schemes during the pandemic; there was only so much time to prep at all, let alone with enough people involved, so implementing new pieces was more difficult than ever. Yet, Lewis excelled.

“Add in some genuine strength and conditioning work, and perhaps Lewis can be even better. Add in the consistency of starting from the opener and expecting that each week, and perhaps Lewis can find some routine.

“The sophomore is one of two pieces in the Irish secondary that are assumed, the other obviously being star junior safety and preseason All-American Kyle Hamilton. New defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman values consistency in coverage — compared to varied looks up front — so much will be put on Lewis’s plate.

“He should be able to handle it. In fact, let’s up the ante. His interceptions in high school set Lewis apart. Anticipate at least two this season. …

“Lewis will need to show quick development to warrant conversation of him leaving after his junior year in 2022, a la Julian Love, but that may be the carrot to dangle in front of him. Love’s strong freshman season set the stage for a breakout sophomore year that nearly guaranteed he would turn pro as soon as he could.

“If Lewis finds the same trajectory, then Notre Dame will be quite pleased.

“It is more likely he ends up a four-year starter in South Bend, hardly something to shake one’s head at.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Rare is the cornerback not plagued by bad afternoons, and those moments linger in the public’s consciousness far longer than moments of success. Human nature creates fickle football fans.

For Lewis, those bad afternoons have been doubly frustrating as they were the final moments of each of his two seasons. Heisman winner Devonta Smith ran by him in the Playoff semifinal in 2020, and Martin’s second-half bonanza ended Lewis’ 2021.

Of his more than 1,200 career snaps — including 800-some last season, leading the Irish defense — losing one-on-one battles to a star like Smith or a fifth-year veteran like Martin should not erase the quality of the vast majority of those snaps. As Martin bullied Lewis throughout that second half, it was never that he had so beaten Lewis. Searching the Getty Images photo database for a photo of Lewis to place atop this article, the images all are engaging. Lewis was competing for each pass. Martin simply had better positioning on all but one of them.

Notre Dame could not roll over a safety to help Lewis, leaving him that half-step behind Martin throughout the second half, but it was hardly more than a half-step.

Lewis is a worthwhile starting cornerback for Mickens and new defensive coordinator Al Golden to work with. When — not so much an “if” — he gets beaten for a touchdown or two at Ohio State, his worthiness will not have genuinely changed.

A season with another half-dozen broken-up passes and a pair of interceptions will underscore Lewis’ ability, even if the season ends with Jordan Addison getting by him for a touchdown.

DOWN THE ROAD

Lewis would need a shutdown season to garner NFL interest after this year. Rather, expect him to weigh that thought after the 2023 season. Even then, it will be something he has to only ponder, not absolutely have to do. The Irish roster is likely going to squeeze out most possible pandemic-added years, but a proven and durable cornerback would be granted such an exception.

Recruiting: Pursued as a cornerback, the consensus three-star prospect chose Notre Dame over offers from Louisville, Washington State and Michigan State, among others, in a widespread recruitment.

CAREER TO DATE

Wilkins looked to be on the verge of consistently contributing in 2021 when a torn MCL cost him the final eight games of the year. After rising to the occasion when inconsistently called upon in 2020, Wilkins had four catches for 61 yards and a touchdown in five games to begin last season.

That may not sound like much, but extrapolate it across a season and a stat line of 11 catches for 160 yards and three touchdowns is somewhat noticeable. Wilkins’ leaping front-corner touchdown at Florida State showed he could be a red-zone threat.

Instead, his season ended the first weekend of October.

2018: 2 games.

2019: 6 games.

2020: 10 games; seven catches for 63 yards and one touchdown.

2021: 5 games; four catches for 61 yards and one touchdown.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

QUOTES

Only one quote matters about Wilkins’ 2022 at this point. After suffering a Lisfranc injury and having surgery on his foot in the first days of April, the question becomes, when will Wilkins return this season? The broadly expected timeline for a Lisfranc injury is six months, which would rule out Wilkins for at least September.

“Joe Wilkins won’t be 100 percent for fall camp,” Irish head coach Marcus Freeman said at the end of June. “I would expect him at some point early in the season to be ready to go. I don’t know if it’s first game or not.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Much of the preseason will be spent building and rebuilding the hype around (Kevin) Austin, but a reasonable argument can be made that he should fall entirely in a ‘Believe it when we see it’ category, and if granting that, then Wilkins’ viability becomes both more pertinent and more necessary for Notre Dame this year.

“He has shown good hands and decent speed, but perhaps the part of Wilkins’ game that most sets him apart from the other Irish receivers is his run blocking. In the Irish offense, that alone can get a receiver plenty of playing time, especially in a season when Notre Dame may get away from using multiple tight ends as much as recent years.

“The Irish leaned on Javon McKinley and Bennett Skowronek to clear the perimeter and distance the second level as run blockers in 2020. They were both much bigger than Wilkins, but receiver run blocking is more about want-to than anything else, and with that imposing pair gone, Notre Dame has a want-to vacuum, perhaps aside from Wilkins.

“The Irish would rather Austin’s dynamic playmaking, of course, but if not taking that for granted, then Wilkins’ reliability and physicality would be a considerable backup option.

“None of that may lead to massive receiving numbers — think in the range of 15-20 catches for a couple hundred yards — but Wilkins showed how just a few snags can propel an offense when his three first-half catches against Duke directly led to 10 points in a 27-13 victory.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Patience. Lisfranc injuries can take a bit to come back from, though they are more problematic for bigger players, such as Jarrett Patterson during the 2021 offseason.

That six-month timeline would put Wilkins back into action toward the end of September. How long will he need to go from his first practices to being Saturday-ready? Guessing that answer would be little more than speculation.

But Notre Dame has an off week entering October, the type of week that could allow Wilkins more practice reps while the few healthy receivers enjoy lesser workloads. Heading to Las Vegas to face BYU on Oct. 8 will be a tougher matchup than many expect, but the Irish then have three games to close October that should all be routs.

Bringing Wilkins back into the offense in that stretch would both give him some time to get up to speed and build toward some success given the quality of the secondaries at Stanford, UNLV and Syracuse.

Wilkins could then appear in up to seven games, not counting a bowl game. Notre Dame needs him to. The Irish receiving corps consists of eight names total, including Wilkins and former walk-on Matt Salerno. When another injury inevitably pops up in September, the dearth of depth will become even more dire.

Wilkins’ return will be a welcome one, no matter if it comes with only half a dozen catches for 100 yards. Every route he can run in place of Thomas or Colzie will be a moment their legs get needed rest.

RELATED READING: Already lacking depth at receiver, Notre Dame loses Joe Wilkins for the spring

DOWN THE ROAD

Wilkins is a locker-room favorite. That was clear when the Notre Dame sideline stopped mid-game against Louisville in 2020 to watch a clip on the Notre Dame Stadium video board of Wilkins discussing his relationship with his father who died before Wilkins was born.

It was clear ago when he was a top pick this offseason for workout teams, highlighted by sixth-year offensive lineman Josh Lugg.

With two separate injuries cutting into two separate seasons, there is more reason than usual to invite Wilkins back for a sixth season in South Bend. Not to mention, the Irish will still be desperate for any receiving options.

Wilkins should return in 2023, and if he is healthy, he should have a contributing role throughout the entire season.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A senior, Hart has three seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Hart will start opposite junior Clarence Lewis this season, the former likely at boundary cornerback and the latter at field corner.

Recruiting: The consensus three-star prospect and Maryland native received offers from most of the Northeast, choosing the Irish over Virginia, Virginia Tech and Boston College.

CAREER TO DATE

Recruited as a receiver, Hart flipped to defense early in his freshman season — before the season, in fact. A shoulder injury cut short his playing time that year and assimilation to the new position.

He then backed up Nick McCloud as boundary cornerback in 2020. Hart did not play all that much, but he was clearly McCloud’s primary backup despite never playing defense aside from those brief 2019 blowouts and not even having spring practices — canceled by the pandemic — to learn the position.

That naturally led to Hart starting last season, and he may have been the one Irish cornerback not individually exploited at any point despite taking more than 700 snaps.

2019: 3 games.

2020: 8 games; 3 tackles with two passes broken up.

2021: 13 games, 10 starts; 42 tackles with four for loss and nine passes broken up with two interceptions.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Along with former Irish safety Kyle Hamilton, Hart led the way on the “Inside the Garage Podcast” last season, part of Colin Cowherd’s Volume Sports network. Though Hamilton is obviously with the Baltimore Ravens now — something that brought Baltimore-native Hart great joy — the podcast will continue in the 2022 season.

In fact, Hamilton’s draft experience led to some podcast fodder.

Frankly, this kind of thorough material as players continue on their careers is an insight into their lives that was never allowed before NIL rights and one that betters the public’s understanding of college football.

QUOTES

Look through Hart’s career again and realize how impressive his 2021 was. He had hardly played cornerback in his entire life and then he became a full-time, reliable starter.

To Notre Dame cornerbacks coach Mike Mickens, that simply means more is attainable for Hart at the position.

“This was his first true year starting, so I think he was still learning corner play. Some of the things that you would naturally have if you played it all your life …,” Mickens said this winter. “Now he understands corner, where his help is, how his technique can be better to me in better positions to make even more plays than he did this year. He has caught up to the game. Now I think it’s more let’s go dominate.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Notre Dame’s recruiting woes in 2017 and 2018 left the Irish desperate for a cornerback years later. Between the two recruiting cycles, they signed exactly one cornerback who would play in multiple seasons, Tariq Bracy in 2018. Otherwise, Notre Dame created a massive vacuum on its defensive depth chart.

“So it sought out McCloud and moved Hart from receiver. The Irish put together a defensive backfield with tape and little else, and it worked in 2020. McCloud played very well.

“For it to continue to work, Notre Dame will need Hart to remain healthy through all of 2021 and never become a liability on the perimeter. Then, and only then, the Irish may have found enough cornerback depth in years to come to have navigated those past recruiting lapses.

“For Hart, a healthy and productive 2021 would include not getting exposed by USC’s talented receivers as Bracy was in 2018; it would include matching the physicality of Wisconsin’s receivers; it would include knocking down a few Sam Howell deep balls at the end of October.

“That is asking a lot, but the Irish have little elsewhere to turn, so Hart will need to deliver for Marcus Freeman’s first defense to hold up. …

“If Hart manages those tall tasks, then he should be entrenched as Notre Dame’s starter for a few years. Using up all four seasons of remaining eligibility would be a stretch, simply in terms of roster construction, but Hart could have the longevity of a traditional fifth-year player, making him a possible three-season starter on the boundary.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

A shoulder injury cost Hart the 2022 spring. That does not spark the concern that came from losing the 2020 spring when he needed development, but it does warrant mentioning as shoulder injuries are some of the more problematic in modern football. Hart’s should be alright, but it is something to keep in mind if he struggles in 2022.

Struggles should not be anticipated. Hart’s acclaim has gained steam this offseason, even with him missing the spring. His rapid development — rapid considering how little defensive experience he had entering the 2020 season — suggests a shutdown season could be on the precipice.

As well as McCloud played in 2020, the Irish have not had a veritable shutdown corner since Julian Love in 2018. Hart becoming one could give new Notre Dame defensive coordinator Al Golden freedom to have some fun with designs.

Even if Hart only has a strong season, he should allow Golden some flexibility. Hart worked at field cornerback for a chunk of last season. That interchangeability will help the Irish disguise some coverages, and that momentary hesitation from an opposing quarterback should be all the Notre Dame defensive line needs.

DOWN THE ROAD

That shoulder worry may push Hart to the NFL if he is healthy throughout 2022. A shutdown season would demand as much.

He could return to start again in 2023, and quite possibly in 2024. Notre Dame would welcome him, given the lack of known depth at the position.

But it will be in Hart’s best interest to chase a mid-round future sooner than later.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A junior, Watts has three seasons of eligibility remaining. While it may be assumed all upperclassmen’s eligibility was inflated by the universal pandemic eligibility waiver, Watts and many juniors are on the typical five-year track.

Depth Chart: Watts is one of four safeties competing to start alongside Northwestern transfer Brandon Joseph, and with the least experience both at safety and on defense in general, Watts is presumably the fourth the pecking order among the four.

Recruiting: A consensus three-star prospect and the No. 90 receiver in the class of 2020, per rivals.com, Watts narrowed his choice to Notre Dame and his homestate Nebraska, despite offers from more than half the Big 10 as well as Tennessee, Louisville and Iowa State.

CAREER TO DATE

As a freshman, Watts played in the two games that bookended the Irish coronavirus outbreak, one of many deep reserves to chip in with spot duty those weeks due to the obvious shorthanded nature of the locker room.

He was still a receiver then. It was not until last September that Watts’ move to linebacker became publicly known, and before he saw a genuine chance there, he moved to safety. His most notable work came against Navy, when the physical nature of his linebacker’s physique fit well facing the triple-option. Watts played well enough to stay in the rotation through the end of the season, part of how Notre Dame navigated the loss of star Kyle Hamilton.

2020: 2 games.

2021: 11 games; 15 tackles.

That may not seem like many tackles, but Watts made those 15 takedowns in just 88 snaps.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Watts appears to make a little spare change by hawking a simple, college football-focused t-shirt, one espousing a belief that few can argue with.

More notably, Watts and the NBC Sports NIL marketplace found a way to help him profit off a hobby.

QUOTES

Watts was viewed as a multi-positional receiver when he enrolled early in 2020. Of course, that spring never happened in a football sense, and Notre Dame admittedly struggled to get newcomers up to speed due to the pandemic’s limitations that fall. So his only moments of note on offense came in 2021’s spring.

Thus, the move to defense surprised Watts, but the Irish needed depth at linebacker after Marist Liufau, Shayne Simon and Paul Moala were all lost for the season to injury. And Watts had excelled as a defensive back in high school, making 68 tackles and picking off three passes in his senior season.

“[The move] caught me by surprise a little bit,” Watts admitted in the winter. “I really wasn’t expecting it too much.

“I played it in high school, so I wasn’t too worried about it. I was excited to go out there and try something new.”

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

Few projections end up further off than this one, undone by Watts’ eventual position change.

“Notre Dame’s uncertainty at receiver will end up to someone’s benefit. Of the 10 receivers on the roster, from a sheer numbers perspective, some receiver or two will break through. Simple logic suggests that is more likely to be one of the four seniors and not one of the two remaining sophomores, but that latter thought cannot be ruled out.

“Watts will get a chance at that, if nothing else, presuming he can stay healthy. His natural hands and comfort chasing a deep ball — exhibited both in that pass from Buchner and in his work as a defensive back in high school — make it clear Watts has collegiate talent. It very well may be he simply needs to find health for a sustained stretch.

“The odds are, though, Watts will provide depth in 2021, especially since slot receiver is the only established position in the group, and more obvious candidates have shown some flashes in their careers at both field (senior Braden Lenzy) and boundary (senior Joe Wilkins; theoretically senior Kevin Austin).”

2022 OUTLOOK

Watts’ 15 tackles on only 88 snaps might be an inflated piece of praise, simply given the nature of playing significantly against Navy, but it is still a valid bit to note. Watts has a knack for finding the action.

That action may blow by him, simply given his lack of experience, especially compared to Joseph, fifth-years DJ Brown and Houston Griffith, and junior Ramon Henderson. That will be the risk of playing Watts, while his eagerness to hit the ball carrier is the reward.

With those other options around, Watts’ time should remain limited in 2022. Plodding offenses will best cater to his skill set, presumably Cal, Stanford and Navy more than any other opponents.

In just those three games, Watts may approach last year’s 15 tackles. By no means does his inexperience condemn him to the bench. The Irish will recognize the cure to that inexperience is playing time, gleaned whenever possible.

RELATED READING: Xavier Watts growing, learning and flashing

BEFORE YOU ASK

Watts is not going to move back to receiver to help with yet another depth issue. Notre Dame may have only seven healthy receivers, including a former walk-on, but Watts has chosen to focus on defense, feeling his long-term ceiling is higher there than at receiver. Based on what he showed last fall, that may prove wise.

DOWN THE ROAD

Getting Watts reps on Saturdays will be vital for Notre Dame as it moves forward. Joseph likely will head to the NFL this spring, while Brown and Griffith will be out of eligibility. That will leave Watts and Henderson the top-two options on the Irish depth chart at safety, at least at first glance.

Others will compete for the starting roles. Namely, current sophomore Justin Walters and a pair of highly-touted 2023 commitments could push Watts.

If his high-school playmaking shows itself this fall or in the spring, those pushes may not matter.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Styles has three seasons of eligibility remaining.

Depth Chart: Styles may be more assured of a starting spot than any other Notre Dame receiver.

Recruiting: A consensus four-star prospect and the No. 6 receiver in the country, per rivals.com, Styles opted for the Irish instead of his homestate Ohio State, where his brother, a freshman safety, ended up.

CAREER TO DATE

Styles played in every game as a freshman, but it was only at the end of the season that he erupted. In the first 11 games, he caught 13 passes for 181 yards, highlighted by a 40-yard catch against North Carolina with 74 yards total that day.

Then in the regular-season finale, Styles caught four passes for 27 yards at Stanford, a season-high in receptions, and in the Fiesta Bowl, he led the way with eight catches for 136 yards and his first career touchdown.

2021: 13 games; 24 catches for 344 yards and a touchdown; one rush for 37 yards.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

Styles and fifth-year receiver Braden Lenzy recently signed a NIL deal with Under Armour and Dick’s Sporting Goods to push a line of athletic apparel that does look rather comfortable.

QUOTES

While Notre Dame has Lenzy and junior tight end Michael Mayer, not to mention junior running back Chris Tyree, as proven offensive playmakers, getting the ball into Styles’ hands will be a priority this fall.

“If he can get his hands on the ball, he can do a lot of great, great things,” Irish receivers coach Chansi Stuckey said in April. “He reminds me of when I first switched to receiver — super athlete, but I didn’t understand the details of it.

“With him, I see a younger version of myself. I’m trying to bring him along the way I was brought along, just working on the details and finding a way to get better every day. Before long, we’ll hopefully have a pretty polished and finished product.

“Getting him the ball in space is the biggest thing.”

For context, Stuckey went to Clemson in 2003 as a quarterback, moving to receiver as a sa sophomore. He had 25 catches for 280 yards in his first season at the new position before catching 64 passes for 770 yards and four touchdowns as a junior.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Preseason practices will shed more light on Styles’ hopes of cracking the receiver rotation. Of him, (Avery) Davis and (Lawrence) Keys, the Irish are likely to incorporate only two at slot. The transfers of sophomores Jordan Johnson (to Central Florida) and Jay Brunelle (to Yale), though, leave a lack of depth on the outside. Moving Keys there would be a surprise, but Davis or Styles could contribute behind Lenzy.

“If Notre Dame makes sure to get practice reps for one of them on the outside, either one, that will serve as an indication of early faith in Styles and an expectation for him to chip in. Irish head coach Brian Kelly is oft-criticized for not utilizing freshman receivers, but that is not entirely accurate. TJ Jones, Chris Brown, Will Fuller, Corey Robinson, Kevin Stepherson and Kevin Austin all played in at least 11 games, to name the highlights.

“Jones cracked 300 yards with three touchdowns, and Stepherson outdid that with 462 and five scores, while Fuller averaged 26.7 yards on six catches. Brown’s greatest contribution remains well-remembered (50-yard gain at Oklahoma), Robinson’s towering frame provided red-zone worries for every opposing defense to fret over and Austin worked through age-old traits issues to make his only collegiate impressions to date.

“Kelly uses freshmen when they can genuinely help. For further evidence, note tight end Michael Mayer and running back Chris Tyree in 2020.

“Of those receivers, Styles may arrive the most complete package, perhaps aside from Stepherson, myriad off-field issues aside.

“That depth alone may be needed for Notre Dame’s offense to find its footing in 2021. Austin has not played a season’s worth of snaps since his final year in high school in 2017; Lenzy’s hamstrings remain a tricky issue; Keys’ bumps and bruises have kept him off the field a few times throughout his career. Any one of those troubles returning could push Styles into a primary role.

“And if not, then Irish special teams coordinator Brian Polian may have a use for Styles as a punt returner. Polian indicated in the spring that he had made sure to get Styles work at the position, and Notre Dame does not have an established piece there, walk-on Matt Salerno notwithstanding.”

2022 OUTLOOK

Expect more. Notre Dame not only needs more out of Styles as a sophomore, but simple logic also makes it clear more is coming.

Styles took 249 snaps last season, though the Irish offense ran 903 plays. With Kyren Williams and Kevin Austin the most notable names now gone, Notre Dame has few options to step in for them. Styles tops that list.

He likely will push 600 snaps this year. At a minimum, he should take 500.

For prediction’s sake, let’s suggest Styles catches 45 passes for 700 yards and five touchdowns, leading the Irish receivers in all three categories. Those numbers would be higher if not for Mayer, who will get the bulk of first looks from sophomore quarterback Tyler Buchner.

On a less serious note, for prediction’s sake, let’s acknowledge the ABC broadcast in 31 days will spend plenty of time on the Styles family, even if Sonny might not start for the Buckeyes. Longtime Irish fans with devoted memories may get flashbacks to a certain Notre Dame quarterback and an Ohio State linebacker circa 2006.

DOWN THE ROAD

Styles will lead Notre Dame in all receiving categories — and this time including tight ends — in 2023, and if those numbers are dramatic enough, that might push him toward the NFL after only his junior season.

The confidence in those statements comes partly from the dire straits of the Irish receivers room. When Davis and Lenzy depart after this season, Styles and his classmates Deion Colzie and Jayden Thomas will be the most proven commodities left. Taking off a third of the offensive snaps will not be an option any longer; Styles might play 800 snaps in 2023.

If he produces in those moments to such an extent he needs to consider the NFL, that will be a welcome worry for Notre Dame.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sixth-year veteran, Davis has one season of eligibility remaining and only via the universal pandemic eligibility waiver.

Depth Chart: Presuming health — and that is no certainty — Davis should start in the slot at Ohio State, backed up nominally by fifth-year former walk-on Matt Salerno but more earnestly by either sophomore Lorenzo Styles, fifth-year Braden Lenzy or incoming freshman Tobias Merriweather, whoever is the clear odd man out of the rotation at field receiver.

Recruiting: Hop in the way-back machine and remember neither Baylor nor Texas Tech was particularly good in 2016, Davis’ senior year of high school. As the consensus three-star dural-threat quarterback and Under Armour All-American weighed his options, he considered those homestate possibilities but was more drawn to Notre Dame. Then again, the Irish were not particularly good in 2016, either.

Notre Dame at least had coaching stability, something Baylor lacked, to put it lightly. And as badly as 2016 went for the Irish, 2015 had ended in the Fiesta Bowl, a bit better than Texas Tech’s 7-6 showing, and Davis committed that following March, before the 2016 debacle of a 4-8 season.

CAREER TO DATE

Davis spent 2017 on the sideline deep down the quarterback depth chart, far enough down it he moved to running back in 2018. Giving up his dream of playing quarterback was admittedly difficult, but Davis did not hesitate.

“I would be lying if I sit here and tell you it was sunshine and rainbows the whole time,” he said in March of 2021. “I definitely went through dog days and days where it was complete confusion, what’s going on, where am I going to be? It was a point where I’m playing in the fall and the spring in completely different positions. From a comfort aspect, you’re not really able to set fast and set your mind on a specific task and grow at it because it’s such uneasiness, so much uncertainty.”

He played a bit from the backfield but was still mired deep down the depth chart, so Davis moved to cornerback to help assuage years of Irish recruiting gaffes. He never quite caught on defensively, the learning curve of the new role so steep Davis could not catch up to the rest of the depth chart, and he moved to receiver.

Finally, Davis found a home. He saw action in 2019 and broke out in 2020, most notably with the two biggest catches of Notre Dame’s pandemic, one to set up the tying touchdown against No. 1 Clemson and the other the tying touchdown.

Then in the midst of a productive 2021, Davis tore his ACL in November. While that cost him a chance to piece together an entire impressive season and left the Irish grasping at straws at receiver in the Fiesta Bowl, it is also the primary reason Davis returned for 2022.

2017: Did not play.

2018: 9 games; 22 rushes for 70 yards with 5 catches for 30 yards.

2019: 11 games; 10 catches for 124 yards and two touchdowns with 6 rushes for 10 yards.

2020: 12 games; 24 catches for 322 yards and two touchdowns with 3 rushes for 57 yards.

2021: 9 games; 27 catches for 386 yards and four touchdowns with 3 rushes for 19 yards.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

We, as a society, are about a year away from the return of an EA Sports NCAA Football video game, and no group may be more excited about that than the current players. They will make some money off the return, but that is not the primary source of their anticipation.

Rather, they will have a chance to play as themselves. Most of the previous generation of college football players — a generation the current sixth-years is more precisely a part of — played the game in high school, dreaming of one day being those players. That was how Davis first started thinking about attending Notre Dame.

“I thought about Notre Dame when I played NCAA,” Davis said to Jac Collinsworth last fall on the ND on NBC Podcast. “I used to play NCAA, the football game, all the time. I ran with Notre Dame a lot. That’s where I first got interested in them. That’s where I learned who Everett Golson was, who Tommy Rees was, Tyler Eifert, guys like that.

“That’s where I originally learned about it, and then you start to see — oh, they’re on TV every week, and I saw them a little bit there.”

QUOTES

There is broad optimism Davis will be available at Ohio State on Sept. 3. That will be less than 10 months since he tore his ACL, though, so that optimism should be measured.

The most aggressive timelines in returning from an ACL injury are usually about nine months, meaning Davis will also likely be limited at the start of preseason practices on Friday, though some Notre Dame-selected workout footage this summer has included him appearing rather healthy.

In late June, Irish head coach Marcus Freeman was somewhat vague about his expectations for Davis’ timing.

“Avery is still working his way back,” Freeman said. “I don’t know if he’ll be 100 percent for the start of fall camp. That’s still to be determined. I think that’s what he’s aiming at.”

(Davis tore his ACL on Nov. 6, 2021, in the play below. At the very start of the video, Davis comes from above the line of scrimmage to make a block, and as he pivots, he goes down.)

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Davis comes across as a probable captain. He has been through too much in full view of his entire team only to find a productive role; respect naturally follows that.

“But when it comes to playing time this year, he may also be the only sure thing among the Irish receivers. Whether he starts at slot or at field receiver, he will be the most reliable option for quarterback Jack Coan on Labor Day Eve (one month!).

“If Davis can maintain that reliability and turn it into consistency throughout the season, then he could approach 40 catches and 500 yards this year, perhaps even more yardage with a few big plays courtesy of Coan’s stronger arm.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Davis was on pace for that 40-catch, 500-yard prediction. Extrapolate his nine games of stats into 13 and he would have ended 2021 with 39 catches for 558 yards and six touchdowns.

Notre Dame would leap at that kind of production in 2022.

It may not come, but more because the Irish offense will operate a bit slower this year and its focuses will be junior tight end Michael Mayer and sophomore receiver Lorenzo Styles. None of that reflects poorly on Davis.

There may also be the wonder of if he will be full-go by Labor Day weekend.

Regardless, a third contributing season at receiver is ahead of Davis, something hard to fathom at any point in 2017, 2018 or 2019.

Davis will almost certainly be a two-time captain, and at some point, offensive coordinator Tommy Rees may let Davis finally throw a pass. It would be a fitting conclusion to the career of the one-time quarterback recruit.

DOWN THE ROAD

If healthy, Davis will go through the myriad combine drills in hopes of signing an undrafted free agent contract with an NFL team. There is little reason to bet against him.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A fifth-year veteran, Griffith will have no eligibility remaining after this season, barring injury. As is, Griffith could return to Notre Dame in 2022 because of only the universal pandemic eligibility waiver.

Depth Chart: Griffith could end up the safety starting alongside Northwestern transfer Brandon Joseph. Griffith, classmate DJ Brown and junior Ramon Henderson will enter preseason practices on Friday competing for that gig, though all should certainly see plenty of playing time this season regardless of that pecking order.

Recruiting: The Under Armour All-American originally committed to Florida State but reconsidered his choice as the Seminoles stumbled to 7-6 while the Irish went 9-3 in the 2017 regular season. Rivals.com rated Griffith the No. 4 safety and No. 43 overall player in the class of 2018.

CAREER TO DATE

Something to keep in mind as the Irish enjoy a bounty of somewhat proven safeties but few such cornerbacks is that Griffith played nickel back earlier in his career and was also tried at cornerback. His work at nickel back in 2018 was out of a bit of desperation after Shaun Crawford was lost for the season, but Griffith played well, considering he was only a freshman.

Griffith worked largely as Crawford’s backup in 2019 before moving to safety in 2020, yet the two names remained intertwined. Griffith and Brown did not wow the coaching staff in preseason practices, so Crawford was moved to safety, as well. In spot duty, Griffith was targeted eight times by opposing quarterbacks in 2020, giving up seven catches for 83 yards.

He improved on that worrisome rate in 2021, to a drastic enough extent it was not as easily tracked. With star Kyle Hamilton sidelined for half the season, Griffith remained the constant of Notre Dame’s back line. Brown initially stepped in for Hamilton but was then replaced by Henderson.

2018: 11 games, 1 start; 14 tackles with two passes broken up.

2019: 13 games; 5 tackles with one pass broken up.

2020: 12 games, 2 starts; 14 tackles with one for loss.

2021: 13 games, 12 starts; 38 tackles.

At 49 career games, Griffith would be a shoo-in to tie or break Kurt Hinish’s record of Irish appearances. Hinish set the mark at 61 last season, so a complete season with a bowl game would put Griffith atop the record books … if not for fifth-year linebacker Bo Bauer.

When Griffith did not play against Navy as a freshman or in the College Football Playoff semifinal loss to Clemson later that season, he fell two games behind Bauer in this unexpected record chase. Bauer has played in every game of the last four years, giving him the inside track to a mark that should never be broken.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

If anything, it is surprising more college athletes have not found chances to show off their shoe fashion via NIL rights.

QUOTES

Griffith entered the transfer portal following the 2020 season, talked into returning to South Bend by Marcus Freeman once he was named the Irish defensive coordinator. Given that hesitation, it was not a certainty Griffith would return for a fifth season.

“I feel like it’s a lot of talent on this team, and I want to be a part of that team, to go out here and leave Notre Dame and leave my legacy, be a part of a team that wins a national championship,” Griffith said in January when asked what led to that choice.

He then put some blunt onus on himself to make that championship happen.

“Honestly, I need to make more plays,” he said. “It’s something that I just want to work on, just playmaking ability, take it day-by-day. Work on my leadership ability.

“One purpose of me coming back, I want to be a captain of this Notre Dame football team.”

The Blue-Gold Game should never be given too much weight, given it is literally a practice, but Griffith was named a captain for the spring practice finale for the second year in a row.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Griffith has never lacked physical talent. That was clear in high school, and he has been blessed by health such that his physical gifts have never been diminished. Instead, Griffith has been held back by indecisiveness and confusion. To put a more precise bow on it, both Griffith and (Brian) Kelly cited his ‘football IQ’ this spring.

“Griffith doubled down on film study in the spring, something that should only increase this fall now that he already has his diploma. If that takes, then suddenly Griffith may be in position to make the most of yet another opportunity.

“‘Two things needed to happen for Houston, right?’ Kelly said in mid-April. “‘opportunity and then making the best of the opportunity. What is making the best, what does that equal? For me, I think a lot of that has just been the awareness of the situation that he’s in and using what I think is outstanding athletic ability and applying it to the particular situations. He’s doing that very well this year.

“‘At times he was using a hammer when he needed to use a screwdriver on particular plays.’

“If Griffith uses a screwdriver throughout 2021, that may largely have an intangible effect, but one area in which it should show is in pass breakups. A safety needs to have more in a season than Griffith has in his career, all of three.

“If Griffith can get his hands on half a dozen passes this year, that will show he is finally diagnosing plays quickly and appropriately.”

Inside the Irish Leftovers & Links: Counting Down the Irish — Others receiving votes;... Heat slows new-look Notre Dame offensive line to open preseason practices;... Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s...

2022 OUTLOOK

Griffith saying he needs to make more plays should qualify as an understatement. In more than 1,000 career snaps, he has directly impacted 74 of them, between tackles and passes broken up. An athletic safety should be around the ball far more often.

For Notre Dame to enjoy anything near the kind of championship success Griffith seeks, he will need to be around the ball far more often.

The fact that Griffith started 12 games for the Irish last season, playing in all 13, and did not break up a single pass is not a reflection of quarterbacks throwing away from him out of respect. If anything, they would have thrown toward him for the first half of the year in order to avoid Hamilton.

There is no benchmark number of passes Griffith should have broken up or should get to this season, but not getting to any was inexcusable and would remain so.

That harsh reality is why Brown or Henderson is more likely to start alongside Joseph. Notre Dame has a fleet of aggressive linebackers, and the defensive line is the best position group on the team. It no longer needs safeties to buttress the run defense or to pressure the quarterback. It needs them to patrol the back line and break up passes.

Presume that is correct and Griffith is idle on the bench on the first few defensive snaps on Sept. 3 at Ohio State. With his nickel back and cornerback experience, he could quickly become the Irish dime back. Either him or turn to a freshman in front of 105,000 fans; as well as early enrollee Jaden Micken fared in the spring, those stakes are a good deal different.

The Buckeyes will force Notre Dame into dime packages frequently — in this context, “dime” means using more than five defensive backs. The best offense in the country will try to go over the top of Al Golden’s defense. If Ohio State does not find those big plays repeatedly, it is a good chance Griffith is involved somewhere, and he may quite possibly break up his first pass since 2020.

RELATED READING: Houston Griffith’s return provides another possible answer to Notre Dame’s safety questions

DOWN THE ROAD

This is it. Griffith would need to get injured in the first four games of the season for there to be any version of a 2023 collegiate thought.

His general athleticism should get Griffith an offseason look by the NFL, but if he does not make more plays in 2022, that look may be short.

2022-23 year, eligibility: A fifth-year veteran, Brown has two seasons of eligibility remaining thanks to the universal pandemic eligibility waiver boosting that count by one.

Depth Chart: Brown will compete with classmate Houston Griffith and junior Ramon Henderson to start alongside Northwestern transfer Brandon Joseph this fall. Entering preseason practices, Brown may have the slightest edge on the other two.

Recruiting: Indecision prolonged Brown’s cycle and led to an eventual flip. The consensus three-star prospect had long been committed to Virginia, but he did not put figurative pen to technological paper during the early signing period. That led to the Under Armour All-American cornerback reopening his recruitment and eventually picking the Irish over Cal and Northwestern while holding offers from Clemson, Ohio State and South Carolina.

CAREER TO DATE

Brown spent 2018 as a cornerback on the bench, playing only in a singular blowout, before he moved to safety in 2019. Still, Brown’s work was largely on special teams.

In 2020, he found a spot in the safety rotation, playing more than 200 snaps while backing up Kyle Hamilton. When Hamilton suffered a season-ending injury halfway through 2021, Brown was the initial replacement starter, though quickly replaced by Henderson.

In all ways, that was a demotion, yet Brown stayed engaged. When Henderson intercepted a pass at Virginia, he gave all the credit to Brown for correcting his presnap alignment from the sidelines.

2018: 1 game.

2019: 9 games; 7 tackles.

2020: 12 games, 1 start; 8 tackles with two passes broken up.

2021: 12 games, 1 start; 42 tackles with one for loss, three interceptions and four passes broken up.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

QUOTES

In five seasons, Brown is about to work under his third defensive coordinator and first with NFL experience. Al Golden has made it clear he will bring some NFL aspects to Notre Dame, most notably in-game adjustments. Per Brown in the spring, there are other new wrinkles, as well.

“I really like the disguises we’re having,” Brown said. “Our other defenses, we’d have certain disguises, but (with) coach Golden, we have a lot more. Then also, there’s a lot more variation to the calls, play cover two, cover three, some man coverage. We mix it up a lot.”

Some of that may stem from Golden having a handful of experienced safeties in Joseph, Griffith, Brown and to a lesser extent Henderson. He can trust them to monitor the defensive alignment from the back line, as well as move them into cornerback roles when needed.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“Given the spring praises and that Griffith was named a Blue-Gold Game captain, it seems most likely he ends up on the top of the depth chart by Labor Day Eve, but Brown will see plenty of work.

“Not only do the Irish wonder about Hamilton’s running buddy and his backup, but they also are unsure of cornerback depth. On what should be another quality defense, the secondary has plenty of questions.

“With that framing, Brown may as well be a known commodity. Particularly on that afternoon against Sam Howell and an electric North Carolina offense, Brown held up.

“While Notre Dame looks for a nickel back, a stable of trusted safeties means Hamilton can cameo closer to the line of scrimmage on occasion. Moving him around will only bother opposing quarterbacks, and if Brown’s biggest contribution is creating that opportunity, it is not a luxury to be overlooked.

“Statistically, Brown will play more, at least 300 snaps, and he will make more than eight tackles, but the versatility he offers new Irish defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman may be the most valuable aspect of Brown’s 2021. …

“Hamilton will head to the NFL after this season, creating an opportunity for both Brown and Griffith. Even if they have trained to run along with Hamilton all these years, starting together should be possible on the back end.

“Proven by (Brian) Kelly’s long want for a fourth safety, there is no younger player yet breathing down Brown’s neck. He should start in 2022 and then be considered in 2023.”

2022 OUTLOOK

For someone who made three interceptions last season, Brown’s play is oddly unmemorable. Perhaps that is a good thing from a safety, an indicator he was not beaten often. But the best safeties make so many plays they cannot be forgotten.

That will most likely be Joseph this season, with his running buddy the more stable of the two safeties, thus allowing the Northwestern transfer some free-range liberties. That may be a scenario ideally-suited for Brown, given the greatest critique of his 2021 was that it was not particularly noticeable.

Henderson’s greater length and sprinter’s speed, though, give him a higher ceiling.

Regardless, Brown should play. Even when Henderson started the final four games last year, Brown played plenty. And as noted regarding Henderson’s interception at Virginia, Brown impacted the game even when he was off the field.

DJ Brown will add depth and experience to Notre Dame secondary in 2022

DOWN THE ROAD

If Joseph has the season he expects to, he will presumably jump to the NFL after this season. Griffith will be out of eligibility. That combination could lead to Brown returning for the rare sixth year.

Sixth-year players should not be assumed until announced in the winter. Notre Dame will have to be sure of its scholarship count; Brown will have to want to live in South Bend for another 12 months.

But other than those hang-ups, there will be little reason to not want a three-year contributor back in 2023 to add a fourth season to those notes. The Irish are not well-stocked at safety beyond these veterans. Without Joseph and Griffith, Notre Dame will have just Henderson, current junior Xavier Watts, current sophomore Justin Walters and Brown around next season, plus the eventual signees.

Watts is a converted linebacker who used to be a converted receiver. He is rocketing up the learning curve, but his most notable asset is his physicality, not necessarily a trait deployed in an every-snap safety. Walters has not gotten a chance to crack the rotation just yet.

Two highly-touted safeties are committed in the class of 2023, but the Irish would rather lean on a Brown-Henderson combination, backed up by Watts.

Few things pertaining to the Irish should be framed in reference to their former head coach, but it is hard to do otherwise in this case after consensus four-star linebacker Jaiden Ausberry (University Laboratory School; Baton Rouge, La.) committed to Notre Dame on Thursday.

Ausberry listed seven finalists in his recruitment, but it likely came down to the Irish and Tigers, despite Alabama, Michigan and Texas A&M being among those seven.

The No. 80 overall prospect in the class and No. 4 outside linebacker, per rivals.com, Ausberry is considered the No. 7 player in Louisiana. He focused his official recruiting visits in June, touring Auburn, Michigan, Texas A&M and Notre Dame.

At 6-foot-2 and 210 pounds, Ausberry is a fast and decisive player. Taking notes of his highlight reel, those two adjectives are scribbled down multiple times. He aggressively chases quarterbacks who dare roll out of the pocket, and while that may burn him in college if not done with discipline, it further underscores his decisive play.

Ausberry is long enough to get his arms around a ball carrier as quickly as his chest hits him. That fast style will presumably need to be fine-tuned in coverage, but that is to be expected of nearly all high school linebackers.

The 21st commitment in the class for the Irish, Ausberry keeps Notre Dame’s class ranked No. 1 in the country by rivals.com. Alabama and Ohio State are ranked Nos. 2 and 3, respectively, with only 18 recruits apiece, so the Irish may not remain atop the rankings into December’s early signing period, but simply competing with the best programs in the country should be the primary recruiting goal. (Especially since recruiting rankings can be misleading as soon as a program needs to add a specialist to its ledger, as one example.)

Notre Dame Recruiting Former Kansas State commit, speedy RB Dylan Edwards joins Notre Dame’s... A third four-star receiver commitment, Jaden Greathouse, elevates Notre Dame’s... Notre Dame’s commitment-filled holiday weekend concludes with four-star...

Ausberry is the third linebacker in the class for Notre Dame, joining consensus four-star Preston Zinter (Central Catholic High School; Lawrence, Mass.) and consensus four-star Drayk Bowen (Andrean H.S.; Merrillville, Ind.).

After Irish head coach Marcus Freeman — defensive coordinator for the vast majority of the recruiting cycle for the class of 2022 — pulled in a quartet of four-star linebackers in the current freshman class (though one has already moved to defensive end), the 2023 trio will add talented depth for Notre Dame’s defense.

Stockpiling positions in back-to-back classes like that is how programs like Alabama and Ohio State develop depth the rest of the country envies.

Zinter (Central Catholic High School; Lawrence, Mass.) visited South Bend just two weeks ago, cementing a recruitment that has trended Notre Dame’s way since Marcus Freeman extended Zinter a scholarship offer last summer.

Zinter also held scholarship offers from Michigan, Ohio State and Georgia, among many others. Rivals.com ranks him the No. 11 outside linebacker in the class of 2023 and the No. 214 recruit overall.

At 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, Zinter displays more speed than may be expected from a linebacker/tight end. That applies to both his top-end speed and his initial acceleration. By no means is Zinter a blazer, but he has more speed than expected.

He also shows an ability to get upfield on a pass rush, and Zinter stays after the ball carrier, even if the play goes to the other side of the field, a knack helped by his ability to shed blocks from receivers with ease.

In 2021, Zinter had 69 tackles with nine for loss, including three sacks, along with 39 catches for 569 yards and three touchdowns as a tight end.

He is the second linebacker in Notre Dame’s class of 2023, joining consensus four-star Drayk Bowen (Andrean H.S.; Merrillville, Ind.), and the ninth overall commitment in a class that currently ranks No. 1 in rivals.com’s team rankings, though it needs to be acknowledged it is still too early in the cycle to put much stock in that ranking.

“We are extremely excited to add John to our group,” Ducks general manager Pat Verbeek said. “John is a gifted player who can quarterback a power play and give us needed scoring from the blueline. He also adds veteran leadership and character to our team.”

Klingberg has been recognized as one of the league’s better offensive defensemen since the 2020 playoffs, when he scored 21 points in 26 postseason games while Dallas reached the Stanley Cup Final.

Klingberg, who turns 30 next month, had been seeking a long-term contract in free agency as the league’s top available defenseman, but nothing apparently materialized. Instead, he will have a chance to showcase his skills with the up-and-coming Ducks, who had plenty of room under the salary cap to accommodate a lucrative one-year deal with significant upside for the team.

His arrival will be another part of a fairly major roster makeover for Anaheim since Verbeek took over the front office during last season. Verbeek traded longtime Ducks defensemen Hampus Lindholm and Josh Manson near the trade deadline after determining he didn’t want to sign the pending free agents to long-term deals, but he had hoped to add a veteran defenseman this summer to boost the group led by Cam Fowler.

Anaheim has missed the playoffs in four consecutive seasons, but the Ducks appear to be primed for improvement in the fall.

The Sharks announced Tuesday that Quinn would replace the fired Bob Boughner as the Sharks overhaul their management and coaching team.

“His previous NHL head coaching experience is valuable to us and he implements a system that will fit with our philosophy of being a hard team to play against,” general manager Mike Grier said in a statement. “We are extremely happy to have him a part of this organization.”

The 55-year-old Quinn coached the Rangers for three seasons from 2018-21, posting a 96-87-25 record. New York never made it as far as the conference quarterfinals in Quinn’s three seasons, missing the playoffs in 2019 and ’21 and losing in the qualifying round in the COVID bubble in 2020.

Quinn had previously been head coach for five seasons in college at Boston University. He also coached the U.S. Olympic team to a fifth-place finish in Beijing last February.

The Sharks have undergone an organizational overhaul after missing the playoffs for a third straight season for the first time in franchise history.

Long-time general manager Doug Wilson stepped down for medical reasons in April and Boughner was fired along with three assistants in late June after posting a 67-85-23 record in two-plus seasons at the helm.

San Jose hired Grier as general manager earlier in July and Grier has already made significant changes in the front office and now has hired a new coach in hopes of turning the Sharks’ fortunes around.

The Sharks traded away star defenseman Brent Burns earlier this month and have added several veterans like forwards Oskar Lindblom, Luke Kunin, Nico Sturm and Steven Lorentz, and defensemen Markus Nutivaara and Matt Benning in hopes of adding more depth to the roster.

Quinn takes over a roster that struggled to score last season but does have a few key pieces in place, including forwards Tomas Hertl, Logan Couture and Timo Meier, and defenseman Erik Karlsson."

“The changes we’ve made were made with the team and organization’s best interest at heart,” Panthers general manager Bill Zito said.
“It was a big shock for me,” Huberdeau said Monday when he and Weegar were introduced by the Flames.
With Calgary, Tkachuk embraced an all-Alberta rivalry with Edmonton.
Now with the Panthers, he becomes rivals with the Tampa Bay Lightning, the team that swept Florida from the second round.","SUNRISE, Fla. — The easiest thing for the Florida Panthers this summer would have been to maintain the status quo, especially after posting the NHL’s best record.

The Panthers went a different way.

Matthew Tkachuk was introduced as the team’s newest addition, three days after the Panthers and Calgary completed a trade that sent Jonathan Huberdeau, MacKenzie Weegar, prospect Cole Schwindt and a conditional first-round draft pick to the Flames.

It was the latest big move for Florida, which earlier this summer hired Paul Maurice to take over for Andrew Brunette – a coach of the year finalist as an interim for the Panthers this past season – and now parts ways with both the franchise’s all-time leading scorer in Huberdeau and a defenseman in Weegar who led the team in skater minutes over the past two seasons.

“The changes we’ve made were made with the team and organization’s best interest at heart,” Panthers general manager Bill Zito said. “And all for different reasons in each instance. In each instance, to be honest, we’ve acquired somebody who’s extraordinary.”

The Panthers believe extraordinary is the right word for Tkachuk, a 24-year-old coming off his first 100-point season. The organization will never speak in anything but superlatives with regard to Huberdeau – Zito made sure to laud both him and Weegar in his opening remarks Monday – but Tkachuk brings a different style, one that Florida thinks it may have been lacking.

“I bring a certain swagger,” Tkachuk said.

He had Florida at the top of his list of preferred destinations when deciding that he wouldn’t sign a long-term extension with Calgary. The Panthers were a top pick for many reasons: young core, the chance to play alongside Florida captain Aleksander Barkov (“top-two player in the NHL, and that’s a fact,” Tkachuk said), and even the chance to wear flip-flops to work most days.

Barkov is under contract for eight years. So is Tkachuk.

“I don’t think it’s a secret that obviously some of the attributes that Matthew brings are areas of the game that we could really use collectively in our group,” Zito said. “So, when that materialized as a reality, then rather quickly, we had to decide that this was something to pursue.”

Tkachuk had career bests of 42 goals, 62 assists and 104 points for Calgary. Huberdeau tied a career best with 30 goals for Florida, plus set marks with 85 assists and 115 points – both of those being franchise records for the Panthers.

The trade was agreed to Friday afternoon in principle and was completed late Friday night, leading to some surprise phone calls.

“It was a big shock for me,” Huberdeau said Monday when he and Weegar were introduced by the Flames. “It’s part of life. Now we have to go forward.”

Weegar had similar emotions: “I get the part of the hockey business and that side of it.”

Zito said the Panthers clearly understood that they had to give something – a lot, in this case – to get something. Tkachuk is five years younger than Huberdeau, which made some sense from planning out where the franchise will be years down the line.

And he immediately began making fans in Florida. With Calgary, Tkachuk embraced an all-Alberta rivalry with Edmonton. Now with the Panthers, he becomes rivals with the Tampa Bay Lightning, the team that swept Florida from the second round.

“I hate Edmonton,” Tkachuk said. “But I hate Tampa more now.”"

The newly acquired Florida forward’s parents are building a home about an hour from where the Panthers play their home games. He has familiarity with the Panthers, is already friends with some of his new teammates, is working on quickly building relationships with head coach Paul Maurice and general manager Bill Zito.

For the first time, Tkachuk – whose father Keith was a longtime NHL star and brother Brady plays for Ottawa – began explaining why he believes leaving Calgary for Florida is the best move for him right now.

“It was just kind of putting myself in a position to reevaluate everything – life, on-ice, off-ice, the future and I came to the decision that I was going to look elsewhere and have a change,” Tkachuk said in an interview with Sportsnet’s Ryan Leslie, streamed on Instagram. “And Florida kind of fell right into my lap within the last week or so. So, very happy with a very tough process. Hard, mixed emotions, sad, happy, everything, but very ecstatic to be ending up in Florida.”

The Panthers will formally introduce the 24-year-old Tkachuk at their arena. Tkachuk plans to spend the next few days in South Florida, looking for a place to live and starting to truly get settled in an effort to have as few loose ends as possible to deal with when training camp begins in September.

He was traded in exchange for fellow left wing Jonathan Huberdeau – Florida’s all-time scoring leader – and defenseman MacKenzie Weegar, along with prospect Cole Schwindt and a lottery-protected 2025 first-round draft pick. As part of the deal, Tkachuk agreed to an eight-year, $76 million contract with the Panthers, days after telling the Flames that he would not be signing an extension with them.

“I was kind of seeing how I envisioned my life going for the next eight-plus years,” Tkachuk said. “I’m here in Florida now, not for an eight-year contract, hopefully for a lot longer than that. I plan on playing, hopefully 15, however many years, and this is where I want to be. I want to be at this part of my life in Florida. That’s just the way it goes. But it’s got nothing to do with my time in Calgary. That was the most special six years of my entire life by far.”

Tkachuk had career bests of 42 goals, 62 assists and 104 points this past season for Calgary. Huberdeau tied a career best with 30 goals for Florida, plus set marks with 85 assists and 115 points – both of those being franchise records for the Panthers as well.

The trade means Calgary is now without its two leading scorers from this past season. Johnny Gaudreau, who led the Flames with 115 points, signed a seven-year deal with Columbus as a free agent earlier this month.

Florida won the Presidents’ Trophy this past season for the first time and won their first playoff series since 1996, but got swept by Tampa Bay in the second round of the playoffs.

“I think that I’m a guy that can go in there and help a lot,” Tkachuk said."

With Laine under contract, the Blue Jackets are another step closer to returning to the playoffs for the first time since 2020.","Patrik Laine signed a long-term deal to stay with the Columbus Blue Jackets, completing the final major item on their checklist to cap off a successful offseason.

The winger re-signed for four years and $34.8 million, a contract that carries an $8.7 million salary cap hit through 2026. The deal allows Columbus to keep the high-scoring winger even after adding top free agent Johnny Gaudreau.

When they surprisingly landed Gaudreau, the big question was whether the Blue Jackets would be able to fit Laine under the cap as a restricted free agent. General manager Jarmo Kekalainen made sure that wasn’t an issue.

“One of our priorities this summer was signing Patrik Laine to a contract extension,” Kekalainen said. “He is a special player, one of the truly elite goal scorers in the National Hockey League, and he has fit in extremely well with our group since his arrival. He is an integral part of the team we are building in Columbus.”

The Blue Jackets made room for Laine by trading forward Oliver Bjorkstrand to the Seattle Kraken for a third- and a fourth-round pick in the 2023 draft.

“It was a difficult decision to trade Oliver, who has given so much to our organization over the past seven years,” Kekalainen said. “However, a move like this needed to be made in order for us to be salary cap compliant after the Johnny Gaudreau and Patrik Laine signings. We are thankful for Oliver’s many contributions to our club, on and off the ice.”

Laine was a point-a-game player last season in his first full year with Columbus. The 24-year-old Finn has 184 goals and 158 assists for 342 points in 431 games NHL regular-season and playoff games with the Blue Jackets and Winnipeg Jets.

Columbus acquired Laine along with Jack Roslovic from Winnipeg in January 2021 in exchange for disgruntled center Pierre-Luc Dubois. The challenge was always keeping Laine around.

This deal does that, and it comes in the aftermath of Gaudreau blowing away the myth that players don’t want to go to or stay in Columbus, after the likes of Artemi Panarin, Sergei Bobrovsky and Seth Jones all wanted out rather than signing long term.

“I thought it was a good spot for me personally,” Gaudreau said after signing. “I think we can have a lot of success here. It’s somewhere that I had circled on my list for a while now. It’s not only from what I’ve heard about the city and where you live, but they’ve got good players on this team, too, and I’m really looking forward to jumping in with this group.”

Beyond Gaudreau and Laine, that group includes top defenseman Zach Werenski, rookie center Kent Johnson, 2021 first-round pick Cole Sillinger, captain Boone Jenner and 27-year-old goaltender Elvis Merzlikins. With Laine under contract, the Blue Jackets are another step closer to returning to the playoffs for the first time since 2020.

Seattle added more talent by acquiring Bjorkstrand, a 27-year-old from Denmark who is coming off a season in which he set career highs with 28 goals and 57 points and matched his previous NHL season best with 29 assists.

“We’re excited to welcome Oliver to our organization,” Kraken GM Ron Francis said. “He’s coming off of a career year offensively playing top minutes in Columbus. His creativity and hockey sense will be good additions to our forward group.”

Going into their second year in the league, the Kraken already this offseason signed Stanley Cup-winning winger Andre Burakovsky, defenseman Justin Schultz and goaltenders Martin Jones and Magnus Hellberg."

295,nbc,sport,Tkachuk’s likely departure adding to Flames’ grim offseason,"['player', 'trade', 'scoring', 'flames', 'grim', 'likely', 'calgary', 'team', 'sign', 'teams', 'offseason', 'list', 'tkachuks', 'adding', 'tkachuk', 'departure']","The Calgary Flames 2021-22 season was a fairly surprising success.
Long time Flames writer Eric Francis reported that could be the first step to a trade sooner rather than later.
According to Wednesday’s report, Tkachuk has supplied the Flames with a list of teams he would be willing to sign a long-term contract with.
The Athletic reports St. Louis, Vegas, Florida, Nashville and Dallas are among the teams on Tkachuk’s list.
The Flames are also still facing potential arbitration cases with two other restricted free agents, forward Andrew Mangiapane and defenseman Oliver Kylington.","The Calgary Flames 2021-22 season was a fairly surprising success.

They finished with the second best record in franchise history, came out of nowhere to win the Pacific Division, and had the league’s most dominant top-line duo in Johnny Gaudreu and Matthew Tkachuk. There were a lot of positives there, even if the playoffs ended in a bitterly disappointing second round loss to their long-time rivals from Edmonton.

Now? Everything is falling apart.

Gaudreau already left Calgary to sign a seven-year contract with the Columbus Blue Jackets, and now it seems that Tkachuk is about to follow him out the door. And that departure seems to be imminent.

Currently unsigned as a restricted free agent, speculation around Tkachuk’s potential exit started to really boil over when the team elected for salary arbitration this week. Long time Flames writer Eric Francis reported that could be the first step to a trade sooner rather than later.

That hot stove ignited into a raging inferno on Wednesday when The Athletic’s Jeremy Rutherford and Hailey Salvian reported that Tkachuk has informed the Flames he will not sign a long-term contract with the team. Given that Tkachuk is one year away from unrestricted free agency, Calgary may have no choice but to trade him now. According to Wednesday’s report, Tkachuk has supplied the Flames with a list of teams he would be willing to sign a long-term contract with. And while he does not have any no-trade protection, that list could impact where Calgary sends him as a team not on that list is unlikely to pay a premium price for a player that will not stay long-term.

The Athletic reports St. Louis, Vegas, Florida, Nashville and Dallas are among the teams on Tkachuk’s list. There are obvious salary cap complications for almost all of those teams outside of Nashvillle, but as we have seen time and time again there are always ways for teams to get around that for a player they want. And every player on that list should be doing whatever it can to make room for Tkachuk.

He is in the prime of his career and the type of player that everybody associated with hockey loves. He is a top-line scorer coming off of a 104-point season, he defends well, he drives possession, and he plays with a nasty streak that makes him a pest to play against. He does everything on the ice.

This is a brutal situation for the Flames. For one, it is nearly impossible to win a trade like this or get anything close to equal value back in return. There are typically only two types of trades that get made involving star players: Either the one-for-one that involves a comparable player (think the Subban-for-Weber type of trade), or the usual top prospect, first-round pick, NHL roster player trio that we always see. Tkachuk is so good and so young that the Flames might be able to get an extra first-round pick out of that.

Beyond that, it would completely wipe out the driving force behind all of the Flames’ success this past season.

When the Gaudreau-Tkachuk duo was on the ice during 5-on-5 play the Flames held a better than 60 percent share of total shot attempts, expected goals, scoring chances, and high-danger scoring chances, while also outscoring teams by a whopping 86-32 margin. It is nearly impossible for a line to do better than that. They completely dominated almost every game.

Without either of them on the ice, the possession and scoring chance numbers dropped down closer to 50 percent while the team was outscored by a 94-97 margin.

Losing Gaudreau was already a massive loss. Losing both him and Tkachuk in the same offseason would be difficult to rebound from.

The Flames are also still facing potential arbitration cases with two other restricted free agents, forward Andrew Mangiapane and defenseman Oliver Kylington.

296,nbc,sport,"NHL Free Agency: Kadri, Klingberg top list of best available UFAs","['available', 'player', 'good', 'klingberg', 'really', 'nhl', 'best', 'play', 'market', 'going', 'team', 'ufas', 'agency', 'list', 'season', 'free', 'kadri']","It is a little surprising that Kadri is still available as he was one of the top players to the UFA market.
As good as Kadri is, he is not without his risks on a free agent contract.
Heinen was a really good find for the Penguins a year ago in free agency, but they were clearly afraid of what his arbitration number would look like.
His goal scoring has dried up, but he is still a really good playmaker and can help out on a power play.
Maybe he does not repeat those numbers, but he is still a really good two-way player that will work on any team’s bottom-six.","We are a week into the NHL’s Free Agent signing period, and even though most of the top players have already found new homes there are still some pretty good players (and relatively big names) remaining on the market.

Let’s take a look at 10 of the most significant.

1. Nazem Kadri. It is a little surprising that Kadri is still available as he was one of the top players to the UFA market. Coming off a career-year offensively and playing a major role on the Avalanche’s run to a Stanley Cup, Kadri figured to be one of the big earners in free agency. And he still probably will be. It is just taking some time. There was a report over the weekend that Kadri is wanting to play for a contender and might need some teams to clear salary cap space before signing him. We will see if that ends up being true. As good as Kadri is, he is not without his risks on a free agent contract. He is already 32 years old, and for as good as his 2021-22 season was there is no guarantee he repeats that production, especially on a team that is not as loaded as Colorado’s is offensively.

2. John Klingberg. After Kris Letang re-signed in Pittsburgh it made Klingberg that top defenseman on the open market, and arguably the only top-pairing defenseman. And he remains unsigned more than a week in. That is odd, and might suggest that the market for him is not as strong as originally thought. If teams think they can add a top-pairing defenseman, they are going to jump at that chance.

3. Nino Niederreiter. This one is also a little surprising. Niederreiter is an excellent middle-six forward that drives possession and will score 20-25 goals for you over the course of an 82-game season. Not a superstar, but a heckuva player that will make any line (and team) he plays on better.

4. Paul Stastny. Stastny will turn 37 early this season but is still, very quietly, a really productive player. Strong two-way presence that can drive possession and chip in second-line offense. On a one-year deal this would be a solid add for a contender that needs center depth.

5. Danton Heinen. Heinen was a really good find for the Penguins a year ago in free agency, but they were clearly afraid of what his arbitration number would look like. So they did not qualify him an offer and allowed him to become an unrestricted free agent. A better defensive player than he gets credit for, Heinen can be a 15-20 goal scorer in the right spot.

6. Phil Kessel. His goal scoring has dried up, but he is still a really good playmaker and can help out on a power play. If you are not expecting him to carry your offense there is still a good contributor here offensively.

7. Evan Rodrigues. Through the first two months of the 2021-22 season Rodrigues was scoring like a top-line player and stunning the league. He cooled off considerably in the second half, but still finished with 19 goals and 43 total points. Maybe he does not repeat those numbers, but he is still a really good two-way player that will work on any team’s bottom-six.

8. P.K. Subban. Like Kessel, you are getting a former star at the end of his career that you are going to have to play in a specialized/sheltered role. And that is fine, because Subban can still shoot it from the point and still has some speed from the back end. As long as you have reasonable expectations and a coaching staff that does not expect him to play 25 minutes a night you can still get a good player here.

9. Jonathan Dahlen. Really intriguing player here. Dahlen is going to turn 25 in December and has just one year of NHL experience. He was a dominant offensive player in Sweden and scored 12 goals in 61 games in his first taste of NHL action on a bad Sharks team. Maybe this year’s Mason Marchment or Michael Bunting on the UFA market?

10. Johan Larsson. Larsson is not going to bring a lot of offense to your team, but you might not find a better defensive forward on the open market at this point. If he brings that and can chip in 10 goals you have a heckuva a bottom-six forward.

[NHL free agency tracker 2022: Full list of offseason signings]5.
Kane is a good player and has been very productive in Edmonton, but when you sign him you are not just signing the player.
He ended up being a really good addition for the Rangers the past few years and a solid No.
[UPDATE: Strome heads west after inking a five-year, $25 million deal with the Ducks.]","With the NHL Free Agency starting on Wednesday we are taking an updated look at our top unrestricted free agent Power Rankings from back in May, removing the players that have already re-signed with their teams (Kris Letang, Filip Forsberg, Valeri Nichushkin, Marc-Andre Fleury, and Rickard Rakell) and adding some of the restricted free agents that were not given qualifying offers on Monday.

The latter list includes former Blackhawks Dylan Strome and Dominik Kubalik, goalie Ilya Samsonov, and winger Danton Heinen.

You might notice one name missing from the list: Boston Bruins forward Patrice Bergeron. We made the decision to leave him out of the rankings because while his contract is technically expiring, he has made it clear that there are only two realistic options for him: Re-signing with the Boston Bruins or retirement. That does not really make him a fit here with the rest of the players on the rankings.

Which players make the cut and where do they rank?

To this week’s NHL Power Rankings!

1. Johnny Gaudreau. Gaudreau picked a heck of a team to have a career year and be the second-leading scorer in the NHL. Gaudreau is an incredible talent, one of the most productive players in the league, and is still at an age where he should have a lot of productive hockey ahead of him. Whether it is Calgary or somewhere else, he is going to cash in this offseason. [UPDATE: Johnny Hockey is heading to the Blue Jackets on a seven-year, $68.25 million deal.]

2. Nazem Kadri. The pro: He had an incredible season and is a really good two-way player at a premium position. The concern: He will be 32 when his next contract begins and he has never really produced at this level prior to this season. Can he duplicate that on a different team, and for how many years?

3. Evgeni Malkin. If he is healthy he is still an impact player, especially on the power play. Maybe not as dominant as he was at his peak, but you would take him on your team if given the opportunity. It seems weird imagining him in a uniform other than the Penguins but that seems to be the way this is heading after it was revealed on Monday that he is testing the open market. [UPDATE: Malkin has signed a four-year, $24.4 million extension to stay in Pittsburgh.]

4. Claude Giroux. Pretty similar to Malkin in the sense that he is not quite the player he was at his peak, but he will definitely make somebody a better hockey team. Would Philadelphia bring him back? Or does he want to take another serious run at a Stanley Cup? [UPDATE: Giroux has signed a three-year, $19.5 million deal with the Senators.]

[NHL free agency tracker 2022: Full list of offseason signings]

5. David Perron. Perron is a steady producer with a track record of being a top-line player on winning teams. Also an overlooked mean streak that some teams will probably love. It probably does not matter where he actually signs because he always finds his way back to St. Louis anyway. [UPDATE: Perron is moving on after signing a two-year, $9.5 million deal with the Red Wings.]

6. Vincent Trocheck. Trocheck is a strong second line center option. Can do everything well, good production, and solid player. The bad news: This is the type of signing in free agency that will look good for two years and then by year three or four you are wondering what you are going to do with him and his salary. [UPDATE: Trocheck is heading to the Rangers after signing a seven-year, $39.375 million deal.]

7. John Klingberg. Klingberg seems to be the type of player whose reputation will depend on who you ask and when you are asking it. His defense gets a lot of criticism, but he can provide some offense from the blue line and is a better all-around player than his critics might have you believe. But is he the player you want to build your defense around? With Letang staying in Pittsburgh he is by far the top defenseman available.

8. Ondrej Palat. Palat might sometimes get overlooked on that Tampa Bay roster, but he has been one of the top players for one of the league’s top teams for a decade. Great second or third line forward for a contender. Not sure Tampa Bay will be able to re-sign him with that salary cap situation. [UPDATE: Palat heads to New Jersey with a five-year, $30 million deal with the Devils.]

9. Andrew Copp. Outstanding defensive forward whose offensive game reached another level this season. Also had a very strong playoff showing that will boost his value for sure. [UPDATE: Copp is moving on to the Red Wings with a five-year, $28.125 million deal.]

10. Evander Kane. Kane is a good player and has been very productive in Edmonton, but when you sign him you are not just signing the player. You are signing everything that comes with the player off the ice, and his off-ice issues are well documented and quite significant (read about them here, here, here, and here). There is a reason Edmonton was able to sign him for so cheap mid-season. But like with Edmonton, it only takes one team being willing to do it. [UPDATE: Kane has re-signed in Edmonton with a four-year, $20.5 million extension.]

11. Darcy Kuemper. Finally, a goalie on the list. Kuemper had a great regular season and has a very solid resume over his career. But teams might look at what happened to Phillip Grubauer when he left Colorado and wonder what happens when a 32-year-old Kuemper is playing behind a worse team. He is leaving Colorado after the team traded for Alexandar Georgiev. [UPDATE: Kuemper signs a five-year, $26.25 million deal with the Capitals.]

12. Jack Campbell. Campbell can be very hit and miss. At times over the past two years he has looked like he put everything together, and at other times he has looked just ordinary. How much faith do you have that you are consistently getting the good version? [UPDATE: The Oilers have given Campbell a five-year, $25 million contract.]

13. Andre Burakovsky. Really productive player and one of the younger players on the list, so his play will probably not drop off too much right away. [UPDATE: Burakovsky heads to the Kraken on a five-year, $27.5 million contract.]

14. Nino Niederreiter. Not a superstar, but he is going to score you 20-25 goals and be a strong possession driver. That is a valuable top-six winger.

15. Ryan Strome. He ended up being a really good addition for the Rangers the past few years and a solid No. 2 center. [UPDATE: Strome heads west after inking a five-year, $25 million deal with the Ducks.]

16. Dylan Strome. There is an argument to be made that Dylan might be an even more attractive option than Ryan given his age and the fact he might be a little cheaper and a better value. It is a mild surprise that the Blackhawks did not want to retain him, but the problem might be that he is just too good for what Chicago wants to accomplish this season. [UPDATE: Strome has signed a one-year, $3.5 million deal with the Capitals.]

17. Dominik Kubalik. Kubalik came out of nowhere with a 30-goal (in only 68 games) performance as a rookie three years ago but has not been able to match that number ever since. He does have some finishing ability and could be a good scoring option for a team that needs some depth. Like Strome, he was not given a qualifying offer by the Blackhawks. [UPDATE: Kubalik is a Red Wing after signing a two-year, $5 million deal.]

18. Max Domi. Creative playmaker with some defensive shortcomings. Good complementary player but probably not much more than that. [UPDATE: Domi heads to the Blackhawks with a one-year, $3 million deal.]

19. Reilly Smith. Very similar player to Niederreiter in terms of what to expect production wise, but maybe not quite the same level of possession driving ability. [UPDATE: Smith is staying in Las Vegas on a three-year, $15 million extension.]

20. Ilya Samsonov. Samsonov was supposed to be the Capitals’ long-term solution in goal and replace Braden Holtby. It has not worked out at all. With the trade of Vitek Vanecek and not qualifying Samsonov the Capitals are now completelly overhauling their goalie position. He might draw some strong interest in an alarmingly thin goalie market with somebody hoping he can still reach some of his potential. [UPDATE: Samsonov has signed a one-year, $1.8 million contract with the Maple Leafs.]

21. Brett Kulak. The former Montreal defenseman teams should have been trying to acquire when the Ben Chiarot bidding war happened. Nothing flashy about his play, but he is a very good mid-pairing defender. [UPDATE: Kulak moves to the Oilers with a four-year, $11 million contract.]

22. Danton Heinen. Heinen had a strong season for the Penguins, scoring a career high 18 goals. But that was probably going to drive up his price tag due to arbitration and the Penguins obviously did not want to go there, especially with the re-signing of Rickard Rakell. Good all around player with some scoring touch.

23. Mason Marchment. A late bloomer, Marchment had a really nice year for the Panthers. Can he repeat it? How much is that one year at age 26 worth on the open market? [UPDATE: Marchment is heading to Dallas after signing a four-year, $18 million deal.]

24. P.K. Subban. Still a big name, still extremely talented with the occasional “wow” moment, but not quite the consistent impact player and superstar he was in his prime.

25. Phil Kessel. Kessel is a new addition to the list with some of the other wings re-signing. He is not an elite goal scorer anymore, but he is always going to be in the lineup and while his goal scoring has started to dry up he remains an excellent playmaker. You need a specialized role for him, but he can still provide something.

When you’re charting the importance of a goalie, you don’t compare them to a two-way center or elite defenseman. Instead, you’re often asking how a goalie’s importance compares to, say, a quarterback.

Yet, for as important as goalies are, they’re extremely difficult to predict. Some may even call them “voodoo.”

Uncomfortably, you don’t necessarily “get what you pay for” with NHL goaltending. Even so, during the past two offseasons, it sure feels like the “floor” keeps rising on what you pay for NHL goaltending — whether that netminder’s track record is strong or not.

Among other things, these recent trends only make (relatively) reliable goaltending more precious, especially on team-friendly deals.

Even shots in the dark are costing at least $2.75 million per year

After wearing out his welcome with the Capitals, Vitek Vanecek received a new opportunity by way of a trade to the Devils.

For a goalie who experienced enough ups and downs to possibly be labeled something of a reclamation project, it’s striking that the Devils still paid up quite a bit for Vanecek: a three-year deal that carries a $3.4M cap hit.

At first, that at least feels a little steep. But then you realize that it more-or-less falls in line with the floor rising for the goalie market. Even goalies with limited track records mostly fetch $2.75M per year. Consider some of the mid-level signings:

Vanecek: three years, $3.4M cap hit (Devils).

Alexandar Georgiev: three years, $3.4M cap hit (Avalanche).

Kaapo Kähkönen: two years, $2.75M AAV (Sharks).

Anton Forsberg: three years, $2.745M AAV (Senators).

Technically, the Maple Leafs traded for Matt Murray‘s contract from the Senators. It doesn’t feel unreasonable to throw him in this group, however, as he carries a considerable cap hit (about $4.7M) amid muted expectations.

Then, add in some weightier investments, such as Jack Campbell‘s contract with the Oilers, and the Red Wings’ proactive Ville Husso addition.

For some, it inspires a reasonable response: all of that spending makes the Capitals’ investment in Darcy Kuemper feel like a better “calculated risk.”

Overall, not a bad point. Yet, with Kuemper’s age (32) and his history of injuries — most recently an eye injury that forced him to work on tracking — there’s enough risk there that Washington could regret the move. (Injuries and health challenges often get worse, especially for big goalies.)

Instead, a different point lingered. The select few NHL teams with excellent goalies (or, let’s be honest, goalies they think are excellent) at value prices should thank their lucky stars.

And, in cases where those bargains are running out soon, they really might want to use that as motivation to go for it. Consider a team-friendly but short-term goalie contract the netminding equivalent to a rookie contract. You may only get one window where a difference-making person is making team-friendly money.

The $5M-ish Goalie Club: Shesterkin, Demko, Saros

Igor Shesterkin: $5.6667M cap hit for three more seasons (through 2024-25)

Personally, Igor Shesterkin was my pick for best goalie in the world in 2021-22. Hockey Viz’s goalie saving charts provide one way to measure Shesterkin’s historically great season. Saving close to 50 goals above expected is truly ludicrous, and you can still make a Hart Trophy debate for Shesterkin. Once he got over a few early struggles, he was spectacular during the playoffs, too.

Considering how much the Rangers leaned on him (and figure to keep leaning on him), he may slip next year. Perhaps you don’t think Shesterkin’s the absolute best goalie in the world, tabbing the reliable machine Andrei Vasilevskiy. That’s perfectly fair.

For the Rangers, that debate is mostly noise. He’s an incredible steal at a bit less than $5.7M per year, and in the meat of his prime at 26 years old.

One can only guess how much Shesterkin will cost in three years. For the time being, the Rangers should try to make the most of this bargain (not to mention whatever’s left of the peaks for Artemi Panarin and Chris Kreider).

Juuse Saros: $5M cap hit for three more seasons

For the past couple seasons, Juuse Saros has stood alongside Connor Hellebuyck and Andrei Vasilevskiy as a workhorse goalie who combines the quantity of all of those starts with the quality of making tough saves. Last season, Saros and Hellebuyck were the only two goalies in the league to make 1,900 saves and face at least 2,000 shots.

By Hockey Reference’s Goals Saved Above Average metric, Saros was in select company the past two seasons: 23.0 GSAA last season, and 20.9 in 2020-21.

That whole time, I couldn’t help but wonder if the Predators were riding Saros too hard. Whether it was fatigue or just bad luck, Saros suffered an injury at the end of the regular season, and was unavailable for the playoffs.

As it stands, there’s some room to worry about such a workload for a goalie who succeeds at least in part based on world-class athleticism.

Much like Hellebuyck, it’s impressive to note that value the Predators already extracted from their goalie bargain. Saros is a steal at $5M, still young at 27, and cheap for three years. Really, his ascent to the elite makes the Predators’ rebuild phobia easier to stomach.

Canucks found themselves a gem with Demko

In many of these cases, NHL teams are reaping the rewards from drafting and developing their own goalies. For all that’s gone wrong with the Canucks, they have some promising young core pieces, and Thatcher Demko may just provide the most bang-for-the-puck. (Though Quinn Hughes is a nice value, especially in a defenseman market that went pretty bonkers last summer.)

Demko’s merely 26, and if he’s truly as elite as he looks, his deal may end up being more valuable than others. That’s because his $5M cap hit lingers for four seasons (through 2025-26), one more than Shesterkin.

Demko stands with Vasilevskiy and Saros as a young goalie who maybe faced too much of a workload. As time goes on, that’s something for the Canucks to think about.

Most of all, they should avoid wasting a great opportunity where Demko’s getting paid less than he’s worth.

Short-but-sweet NHL goalie bargains

Connor Hellebuyck: $6.166M for two more seasons

You could argue that the Jets already got their money’s worth for Connor Hellebuyck’s six-year, $37M contract. He’s been one of the truly great workhorses in the NHL, propping up some abysmal Jets defenses.

But the Jets could end up haunted by the thought that they wasted having one of the best goalies in the world at such a team-friendly $6.166M cap hit. (The Jets have also not-quite fully exploited the value they’ve enjoyed with the likes of Mark Scheifele.)

At 29, Hellebuyck could very well deliver far above his cap hit for these remaining two seasons. With Rick Bowness being fixated on defense above anything else (at least in Dallas), it may be a more nurturing situation.

Really, though, this contract is part of a fascinating window for Winnipeg. Scheifele’s only under contract for two more seasons, and Pierre-Luc Dubois could set things up to walk as a free agent around that time.

If things don’t work out, that Hellebuyck contract could be a key part of a Jets rebuild. Either way, it’s already been a bargain for Winnipeg, and could very well be extremely fruitful for two more seasons.

Ilya Sorokin: $4M for two more seasons

For those who pay attention to stats along the lines of Goals Saved Above Average/Expected (there are quite a few variations of the general idea), two names rose as 2021-22 went along: Ilya Sorokin and Ville Husso. In Sorokin’s case, he built a credible argument to end up a Vezina Trophy finalist.

#Isles Mathew Barzal on Ilya Sorokin: ""There hasn't been enough Vezina talk, really."" Barry Trotz: ""He's absolutely correct on that."" Says Sorokin won't get votes b/c Isles aren't playoff-bound. Adds narrative in NY is Igor Shesterkin. ""Our guy is right there."" — Andrew Gross (@AGrossNewsday) April 16, 2022

Amusingly, the biggest nitpick of the Islanders’ savvy, projection-based investment with Sorokin is that the savings are a bit brief. The 26-year-old’s $4M cap hit only runs for two more seasons.

Two other factors loom. For one, it remains to be seen if Barry Trotz’s departure makes life tougher for Islanders goalies. Beyond that, there’s the other Islanders goalie: Semyon Varlamov carrying a $5M cap hit dilutes some of the bargain of having a possibly elite young goalie at $4M.

To play “4D Chess” for a second: perhaps Varlamov eats up enough starts to limit Sorokin’s volume, and then the Islanders might extend Sorokin for another value contract? Maybe that type of thinking slips toward Charlie Kelly’s mailroom conspiracy board, but if nothing else, it’s at least a short-term boon for the Islanders.

Premium prices probably justified

Andrei Vasilevskiy: $9.5 million AAV for six seasons (through 2027-28)

Over and over again, I wonder if the Lightning will finally lean on Andrei Vasilevskiy so much that he “breaks.” Year after year, he defies those worries.

With Vasilevskiy, you wade through certain layers of nitpicking. Close to the time he signed his big, current deal, people pointed out that he mainly saved around the number of goals he was expected to. When wading into “best in the world” debates, one might point to relative hiccups, like so-so numbers in the Maple Leafs series.

Yet, as a whole, Vasilevskiy pulls off the remarkable feat of being a bargain at $9.5 million.

By racking up all of those miles — not just heavy in the regular season, but with three straight Stanley Cup Final appearances — I still wonder if the bottom might fall out. Such a thought could make that lengthy, $9.5M investment go “Just About Bob.”

Of course, there’s an obvious distinction even if Vasilevskiy starts to shew closer to Sergei Bobrovsky. The Lightning have already won two Stanley Cups with him.

And would it be that shocking if he just kept chugging along? I’d love to see Tampa Bay find a way for more backup help, but if that never happens, Vasilevskiy is still (somehow) just 27.

Other goalies who may or may not be bargains

In the end, it’s about making the best, most-educated guesses you can about a mysterious position

To reiterate: even the most promising-looking goalies on this list could flop. And it’s not outrageous for a deal that looks dicey (multiple years of Jordan Binnington at $5M, maybe even Bobrovsky?) could work out, short-term and/or long-term.

There are just so many variables that go into goalies succeeding, failing, or merely getting by.

That said, if recent seasons are decent indications of what’s next for at least the most established goalies, then Shesterkin, Saros, Demko, Sorokin, and others could improve their teams’ odds in enormous ways."

That is one good player in and three good players out the door.","The start of the 2022-23 NHL season is still a couple of months away, so there is still time for teams to round out their roster and make moves this offseason. That is good news for the New York Rangers because after the first month of the NHL offseason their roster still has some pretty significant question marks and concerns.

This was always going to be an important offseason for the Rangers because we were going to find out what they learned about why they had their success this past season and what they felt they still needed to do. For as successful as the season was, their playoff formula (sensational goaltending and a dominant power play overshadowing bad 5-on-5 play) is not exactly one that you want to rely on long-term. Being content with the progress and status quo was not going to be good enough.

The early returns are not exactly promising.

The Rangers’ one big move so far this offseason has been to sign unrestricted free agent Vincent Trocheck to a seven-year, $39.75 million contract.

Trocheck is a very good player, and in the short-term should be a nice fit as the team’s new second-line center. The seven-year term is a big picture concern, but the Rangers do not have to cross the bridge just yet.

The more immediate concern is that the signing of Trocheck (a really good player) came at the expense of losing Ryan Strome (also a pretty good player), Andrew Copp (also a pretty good player), and Frank Vatrano (also a pretty good player) in free agency.

That is one good player in and three good players out the door.

Strome and Trocheck have been pretty close to a wash offensively over the past few years, while Trocheck has a nice defensive advantage. So there is an upgrade there at the second-line center spot. That is fine.

The problem is they not only lost Strome, but also lost Copp and Vatrano. Strome has been replaced. Copp and Vatrano have not.

While they did not spend a lot of time with the Rangers last year (both joining the team at the trade deadline) their arrivals were significant in taking them from a nice young, up and coming team, to a dangerous team that would be capable of doing real damage in the playoffs. They gave a team that needed scoring depth and more punch offensively exactly that. Copp, along with his offensive production (14 goals, 18 assists and 32 total points in 36 regular season and playoff games), was also a significant defensive upgrade.

There is still time for them to be replaced. But it is going to be a challenge. Most of the major trades have been made. The main free agents have mostly been picked over (though bargains and value can still be found). Even worse, the Rangers have less than $4 million in salary cap space to work with while still needing to re-sign restricted free agent Kaapo Kakko. They almost have to more salary out for another move.

At this point the Rangers seem to be counting on three things happening this season: Shesterkin being as dominant as he was a year ago, Chris Kreider‘s goal scoring surge being for real and not an outlier, and their young players taking a big step forward.

Can Shesterkin carry them again?

Shesterkin was the biggest factor in the Rangers’ regular season and postseason success. He was the best goalie in the league by a substantial margin and at times put the team on his back.

But for as dominant as he was, can he be that good again over a full season?

The problem with relying on percentages is that percentages fluctuate, even for great players. Since the start of the 2000 season we have seen 18 goalies play at least 40 regular season games and finish with a save percentage better than .930, including Shesterkin. Those goalies, no matter how good they are, almost always regress the following year. The only one that did not was Carey Price in 2015-16 whose save percentage went up by .001 …. while playing in only 12 games due to injury.

The full list.

On average, it was a .015 drop the next season. Even if you took .010 or .015 off of Shesterkin’s numbers this season he would still be in the top-five of the league, and perhaps even still lead the league. He was that much better than everybody else. But a 10-15 point drop in save percentage on the same number of shots is an additional 15-25 goals against. That is significant.

“Our goalie is better than your goalie, so let’s just see what happens” is not a sound plan. It did not get Henrik Lundqvist a Stanley Cup in New York, and it will not get Shesterkin one, either.

The young players will dictate everything

This is going to be the biggest key for the Rangers, and it can go a long way toward fixing a lot of the questions listed above, from scoring depth, to a potential Kreider regression, to improving 5-on-5 play.

This is where the Rangers can make their noise. Quite honestly, it is where they are going to have to make their noise.

We saw some promise from their Kid Line of Kappo, Alexis Lafrenière, and Filip Chytill in the playoffs. And they were great together. But it was also only a 140-minute sample size of 5-on-5 play. And while each of them has shown flashes of potential at different times in their young careers, they still have to show they can do it over a full season. Lafrenière and Kakko are still very young, and even though they were both top-two picks those players progress at different speeds. Not every top pick is an immediate superstar. But we are still getting to a point where we are going to need to see a significant jump if they are going to be star players, or just pretty good players. If it is the former, that is a positive game-changer for the Rangers. If it is the latter, it still leaves some questions.

K'Andre Miller and Braden Schneider can also make a significant impact on defense, and then there is the wild card that is Vitaly Kravtsov.

There is a ton of potential there with all of them. But not every young player or prospect pans out exactly as you hope, especially when you are dealing with five or six of them all at once. Some will exceed expectations, some will match them, some will get hurt, some will just be a disappointment.

This is still a good team. But is it as good as the 2021-22 team? Will it be better?

The success or failure of this group of players is going to go a long way toward determining how their 2022-23 season goes.

Given the roster moves they have made (and not made) this offseason, they almost have no choice.

304,nbc,sport,NHL Power Rankings: Best free agent signings so far this offseason,"['player', 'red', 'deal', 'nhl', 'agent', 'million', 'wings', 'best', 'players', 'team', 'term', 'offseason', 'power', 'far', 'signing', 'signings', 'free', 'rankings']","In this week’s edition of the NHL Power Rankings we take a look at the best free agent signings of the offseason (so far).
We are limiting it this to players that signed after the opening of the free agent signing period this past Wednesday.
The most stunning free agent signing was also the best.
Perron is getting older, but this is a really strong deal for a Red Wings team making to take a big leap forward.
He is a legit top-line winger and the Red Wings have almost no risk on a two-year contract.","In this week’s edition of the NHL Power Rankings we take a look at the best free agent signings of the offseason (so far).

While there are still a handful of top free agents still available (Nazem Kadri, John Klingberg), most of the top players have already found new homes. Some of those signings are going to work out very well. Others might not.

So let’s try to figure out which ones might be the best investments. We are limiting it this to players that signed after the opening of the free agent signing period this past Wednesday. So players that re-signed with their teams before that are excluded from the list. Also a reminder: This is not a ranking of the best players to sign. It is a ranking of the best signings, taking into account the player, production, contract term, salary cap hit, risk, and total value.

Who all makes the cut?

To this week’s NHL Power Rankings!

1. Johnny Gaudreau, Columbus Blue Jackets (seven years, $68.25 million). The most stunning free agent signing was also the best. Yes, most long-term free agent contracts end in a buyout or a trade. But there are always exceptions. This could very easily be an exception. Gaudreau is a top-tier offensive force and is still at an age where he should perform at an extremely level for the foreseeable future. The Blue Jackets needed a star, and they got one. Even If Gaudreau is not a 115-point player again and levels off at an 80-or 90-point level he will still be worth it.

2. Claude Giroux, Ottawa Senators (three years, $19.5 million). Giroux might be getting older, but he is still an outstanding player and the Senators are getting him on a really good deal. Not too much term, reasonable salary cap hit, not much risk, and it helps round a rapidly improving Senators’ top-six. Are they a playoff team because of it? Probably not. But they are better. And more entertaining.

3. Darcy Kuemper, Washington Capitals (five years, $26.25 million). The Capitals badly needed a goalie and completely revamped the position by dumping Ilya Samsonov and Vitek Vanecek and signing Kuemper in free agency. Kuemper drew some criticism in the playoffs this year, but his overall track record in the NHL is very strong. Among goalies with at least 100 games played over the past three years, Igor Shesterkin is the only goalie with a better all situations save percentage than Kuemper’s .920.

4. Frank Vatrano, Anaheim Ducks (three years, $10.95 million). Absolutely love this signing by the Ducks. Vatrano is not a star, but he can do two things really well: Generate shots and score goals. The Panthers never should have traded him, the Rangers are going to miss him, and the Ducks got him on a nice three-year deal for just $3.6 million per year.

5. David Perron, Detroit Red Wings (two years, $9.5 million). Perron is getting older, but this is a really strong deal for a Red Wings team making to take a big leap forward. He is a legit top-line winger and the Red Wings have almost no risk on a two-year contract.

6. Andrew Copp, Detroit Red Wings (five years, $28.25 million) . This deal reminds me a lot of the Philip Danault signing in Los Angeles a year ago. Similar term, player, cap hit, and team situation. I like Copp over somebody like, say, Vincent Trocheck because he is a year younger, better defensively, and has a term that is two years shorter.

7. Vincent Trocheck, New York Rangers (seven years, $39.375 million). Trocheck is a very good player and will be a nice second-line center for the Rangers. But this is also the type of free agency contract I hate and the type that should scare the heck out of you as a fan of a team. A seven-year term for a soon-to-be 30-year-old non-star is not going to end well. Also, the Rangers had to watch Copp, Ryan Strome, and Vatrano all leave to make this signing happen. Does that make them a better team?

8. Andre Burakovsky, Seattle Kraken (five years, $27.5 million). Good player on an okay contract, but I do wonder what the overall plan is here for Seattle? Just a weird approach from the very beginning. How will he produce away from the high powered Avalanche offense?

9. Ryan Strome, Anaheim Ducks (five years, $25 million). Strome averaged a 22-goal, 60-point pace per 82 games during his time with the Rangers and was a legit second-line center offensively. He has had some shortcomings defensively at times, but if he repeats what he did in New York with the Ducks he will be a fine addition.

10. Dylan Strome, Washington Capitals (one year, $3.5 million). What I love about this deal is just how cheap it is. One year and only $3.5 million? For a player that will probably a produce a similar level of offense as Copp or Trocheck down the middle? He might be a half-tier below those two as overall players, but the price is certainly right as they look to get by without Nicklas Backstrom.

11. Mason Marchment, Dallas Stars (four years, $18 million). If he is just a late-bloomer and his 2021-22 season was not a fluke this contract could be one of the best signed all summer. But he has so little NHL track record to go by it is tough to be fully convinced of that.

12. Ondrej Palat, New Jersey Devils (five years, $30 million). He is not Johnny Gaudreau or Alex DeBrincat, but Palat is a strong top-six addition to a Devils team that badly needs some complementary players for Jack Hughes and Nico Hischier. In the short-term, at least. How many more years does he have as a top-six producer?

13. Calle Jarnkrok, Toronto Maple Leafs (four years, $8.4 million). Jarnkrok is one of the steadiest players you will find in the NHL in terms of what he brings. He will score 15 goals, 30 points, play good defense, and be a really solid third-line player. The four-year term is maybe a year too long, but you can not beat the salary cap number.

14. Brett Kulak, Edmonton Oilers (four years, $11 million). Kulak is not going to carry the Oilers’ defense, but he was very good after being acquired at the trade deadline and this is a very strong re-sign by the Oilers after he went to market. In a thin defense crop, the Oilers did well.

15. Dominik Kubalik, Detroit Red Wings (two years, $5.5 million). This is a nice gamble for the Red Wings. Kubalik has his flaws, but he does have some finishing ability as a goal scorer even if it it peaked as a rookie. The price is right for this.

16. Ilya Mikheyev, Vancouver Canucks (four years, $19 million). The Canucks always have a couple of random players in the middle of their lineup making far more than you realize for too many years. This one might continue that trend. Mikheyev does a lot of things well, but I am not sure he is going to score 20 goals again.

17. Jack Campbell, Edmonton Oilers (five years, $25 million). Just not sure how much I trust Campbell to be the answer behind a weak defensive team. That contract is concerning.

18. Josh Manson, Colorado Avalanche (four years, $18 million). Manson was a good addition for Colorado at the trade deadline, but this also seems like a luxury re-signing (and maybe even an overpay) for a team that is already loaded on defense.

19. Jan Rutta, Pittsburgh Penguins (three years, $8.25 million). The Penguins really tried to overhaul their defense this offseason and it started with the Rutta addition. He is not going to be one of their top defenders, but given what players like Erik Gudbranson and Ben Chiarot signed for this is not a bad deal for what the Penguins will expect of him.

20. Justin Schultz, Seattle Kraken (two years, $6 million). Another bizarre move for Seattle, but again, given the market for other defenders it is not a terrible deal.

305,nbc,sport,"Burns, Pacioretty trades give Hurricanes what they badly needed","['point', 'hurricanes', 'badly', 'pacioretty', 'needed', 'burns', 'goals', 'maybe', 'trades', 'teams', 'cap', 'hes', 'brent']","While the Hurricanes take on certain risks with both Burns and Pacioretty, those trades could be breakthrough moments for a team constantly knocking on the door to contention.
In adding Brent Burns and Max Pacioretty, the Hurricanes could hit both notes: playing to their strengths to a better degree, but maybe adding a new wrinkle.
At various times, I’ve opined that the Sharks could’ve used Brent Burns’ dangerous shot to better success if he was shooting from more dangerous places.
But the delight with Brent Burns’ penchant for point shots is that it mixes so well with the Hurricanes’ style.
But the larger point remains: the Hurricanes addressed some of their biggest (few remaining) concerns with trades for Burns and Pacioretty.","The Carolina Hurricanes are no strangers to pulling off smart moves during the offseason — in free agency, and at the NHL Draft. So, to an extent, maybe this is business as usual. Yet, when you consider how aggressively — and brilliantly — they addressed goal-scoring issues by trading for Brent Burns and Max Pacioretty, this is one of the Hurricanes’ most exciting offseasons.

Sure, losing a versatile forward like Vincent Trocheck hurts. And, after brushing off the ugly elements of a Tony DeAngelo signing, he rewarded them with good bang-for-the-buck.

From a big-picture perspective, though, those losses don’t necessarily change the team’s trajectory. While the Hurricanes take on certain risks with both Burns and Pacioretty, those trades could be breakthrough moments for a team constantly knocking on the door to contention.

After falling to the Rangers in a tight series, Rod Brind’Amour acknowledged the possibility that the Hurricanes needed that extra bit of finish.

“Do we have elite goal scorers? Maybe not,” Brind’Amour said, via the Associated Press. “But we have great players. We’re built a little differently than some other teams. That’s OK. You’ve got to play to your strength.”

For years, the Hurricanes have consistently scored less goals than expected. They’ve often been doomed by a double-whammy: bad shooting luck mixed with goalies who gave up more than they seemingly should have.

Like diligent craftsmen, the Hurricanes have added layers of polish and nuance each offseason. In some cases, that meant addressing glaring issues, such as goaltending. But it often still felt like a band getting heavier and louder, rather than exploring different sounds and genres.

In adding Brent Burns and Max Pacioretty, the Hurricanes could hit both notes: playing to their strengths to a better degree, but maybe adding a new wrinkle. Maybe it ends with a “Ballad of Stanley Cup?”

A team in love with point shots adds a point shot machine

If you follow the Hurricanes, you likely know that they play a very straight-line, sometimes “smash mouth” game. Where other contenders prize control — of the puck, and when they risk losing the puck to gain scoring chances — the Hurricanes overwhelm. Maybe they should be called the Blizzard, as they try to bury opponents under flurries of chances and pressure.

(They don’t give you delicious-if-strangely-salty ice cream, though.)

Hockey Viz’s heat map for the Hurricanes captures that attack in detail:

Normally, such an abundance of point shots would be a concern. Those shot attempts often qualify as hockey’s version of “empty calories.”

Yet, as you can see from all of that heat in front of the net, the Hurricanes still create a lot of “high-danger” chances. They just do so in their own, unusual way.

At various times, I’ve opined that the Sharks could’ve used Brent Burns’ dangerous shot to better success if he was shooting from more dangerous places. To an extent, I’d love to see the analytics-leaning Hurricanes also encourage him to occasionally wonder to Alex Ovechkin‘s “office.”

(Even if it’s just temp work, so to speak.)

But the delight with Brent Burns’ penchant for point shots is that it mixes so well with the Hurricanes’ style. Maybe his point shots could be the Reese’s peanut butter cups to that already-tasty blizzard?

Pacioretty may actually be the most enticing Hurricanes addition

Considering his array of exotic beasts and trophy case including a Norris, it’s not surprising that Brent Burns is the biggest name of the Hurricanes’ big additions.

Personally, though? Max Pacioretty actually seems like the most important addition.

Since joining the Golden Knights in 2018-19, Pacioretty averaged .87 points per game (194 in 224 games), tying him with Nicklas Backstrom and Ryan O'Reilly for 48th-best. Only Sebastian Aho (1.01) and Teuvo Teravainen (.88) averaged more during that span.

Of course, goals are what the Hurricanes sought most of all, and few score quite like “Patches.” During the past three seasons, Pacioretty ties Aho and others for 18th-place with 47 goals at 5-on-5.

Correct for time missed, and he’s even more impressive. Since 2019-20, Pacioretty averaged a 1.26 goals per 60 minutes, a top-10 rate. He’s not just a player who scores goals or does nothing else, either, as his underlying stats are promising.

Here are Pacioretty's microstats. Great chance creation both off the cycle/forecheck and the rush. Fun! pic.twitter.com/wVJ2fhX5OK — JFresh (@JFreshHockey) July 13, 2022

Honestly, I believe that Mark Stone‘s ascent to more mainstream recognition might have kept Pacioretty’s outstanding work in the shadows a bit. Maybe sprinkle in numbers that were diluted by injuries and COVID-shortened seasons, and you get to a fuller explanation.

In free agency, teams might find snipers. However, those players often skew toward the one-dimensional. You’re unlikely to find a truly elite option. By going the trade route, the Hurricanes landed a more likely upgrade — and potentially a big one.

Low-risk, potentially high rewards … but there are SOME risks

To an extent, these trades really feel like free agent moves because the Hurricanes gave up so little to land Brent Burns and Max Pacioretty. At least, in immediate terms. (Perhaps the Sharks will treasure the goalie prospect they received?)

Even the contracts aren’t as scary as you’d see in free agency.

Work through the name recognition, and Brent Burns at $8M is a bit steep. Yet, with salary retention, his cap hit’s now a more digestible $5.28M per season through 2024-25 (the same year Jaccob Slavin needs a new contract).

Pacioretty’s $7M cap hit only runs through the 2022-23 season.

On paper, you’re not going to make much better bets at about $12.3M in salary cap space. Particularly without massive term.

But there are risks here. As much as one praises Pacioretty for producing when healthy, he carries risks of additional injuries. You could argue he’s an “old 33” considering all he’s been through.

For those who don’t delve into Cap Friendly on the reg, it might be shocking to realize that Brent Burns is already 37.

Ideally, someone like Slavin can be the stay-at-home defenseman while Burns roves like one of his exotic beasts. But there’s the risk that Burns roams to such a degree that he gets lost — to the point that even Slavin could get compromised.

As time goes on, the risk:reward ratio with Burns’ game has become less of a net-positive. It doesn’t mean that Burns isn’t worth it — especially at a reduced price — but it’s something to watch. After all, the Hurricanes are hoping to contend, so high-profile mistakes could sour a situation.

Most of all, Burns is a big beast of a man, and he’s put a lot of miles on his body. Injuries and general decline both loom as credible threats.

Hit all the right buttons, and this could be the best Hurricanes team yet

So, yes, there’s some fine print here and there. But the larger point remains: the Hurricanes addressed some of their biggest (few remaining) concerns with trades for Burns and Pacioretty.

Really, even if this all translates to fairly similar results, this should be exciting to watch.

Other teams could learn from this mixture of patience (keeping some salary cap space available) and aggression (jumping on an opportunity when a team needs to shake a contract loose). For all we know, they may be taking notes trying to chase what the Hurricanes become in 2022-23."
306,nbc,sport,Maple Leafs set up for big changes soon — if they want them,"['marner', 'set', 'nylander', 'maple', 'big', 'dubas', 'contracts', 'players', 'matthews', 'changes', 'cap', 'leafs', 'soon']","Yet, the scary thing about the Maple Leafs could also feel liberating.

The Maple Leafs may appreciate certain deals coming off the books, such as Alexander Kerfoot.
The Maple Leafs don’t have everything locked in place, which could end up a negative.","As a team that’s perpetually butting its head against the salary cap ceiling, you’d think that the Maple Leafs look doomed to that fate forever.

Often, that’s the outlook of many teams who spend big and take large risks to contend. If the current plan fails and the GM gets booted, the next person usually isn’t just looking to improve the team. They usually have to clean up big messes. (See: Mike Grier being left to clean up the Sharks.)

Yet, the scary thing about the Maple Leafs could also feel liberating.

If things don’t work out in this era of the Maple Leafs, they’re structured for big changes. It’s a thought that’s hovered here and there. Credit to Cap Friendly for tweeting it out in a way that really hammers home the point in a visual manner:

The #LeafsForever only have 4 roster players signed past the next two seasons. Rielly & Järnkrok are the only 2 players that are signed past the 2024-25 season. Tavares & Marner are signed until the end of the 2024-25 season. All other contracts expire by the end of 2023-24. pic.twitter.com/4eeksxm8hb — CapFriendly (@CapFriendly) July 15, 2022

Saying goodbye to Matthews/Marner would mostly be bad, but Maple Leafs can change gears if they want to

Over the years, rival fans have tormented Maple Leafs fans about Auston Matthews leaving town, possibly for the Arizona Coyotes. Sometimes Maple Leafs fans themselves have wallowed in that grim scenario, or other similar ones.

Matthews, 24, didn’t just sign a contract that carried a hefty (but actually still very team-friendly) $11.64M cap hit in 2019. It also only kept him under contract for mid-range term. In a league where star players almost always sign for seven or eight years, Matthews merely inked a five-year contract.

Similarly, Mitch Marner and (excessive trade rumor magnet) William Nylander signed six-year contracts with the Maple Leafs.

Really, the standout long-term contracts were handed out to John Tavares when he was a hot-ticket free agent, and Morgan Rielly to keep him off that market.

Yet, even with Tavares’ often-criticized contract, you can already see some light at the end of the tunnel. His $11M salary cap hit expires after the 2024-25 season.

Overall, it’s still fair to picture this working against the Maple Leafs.

After vastly improving on defense (to the point that he justifies Selke Trophy mentions), Auston Matthews surged to his first Hart Trophy in 2022-23. He’s one of those players who are in rarified air where they could essentially “name their price” on their next contract. The Athletic’s model placed Matthews’ “market value” at $22.3 million. The Maple Leafs — or some other team — would be lucky if Matthews’ next contract isn’t a lot more expensive than his current one.

As much as people love to pick on Mitch Marner and William Nylander, they also deliver far more than people give them credit for. Marner’s absolutely an elite playmaker who’s unusually dangerous as a penalty kill counterpuncher. By that same Athletic model, he wasn’t worth his much-maligned near-$11M price tag; he was worth more: $17.5M. While it’s not as dramatic, William Nylander’s easily worth a cap hit in the $7M ballpark (in my opinion, and based on that model).

So it’s not as though this situation couldn’t be difficult for Toronto. That said, it’s fascinating that if the Maple Leafs decide this mix isn’t working, they can shift gears more easily than any perennial contender in recent memory.

Would a full-blown rebuild be wise? Probably not, but that route could even end up open.

Kyle Dubas‘ window is even smaller

That’s especially relevant because of just how big of a gamble Kyle Dubas took this offseason.

For all the defenses about the term not being that bad, Matt Murray still having two years on a scary cap hit (even post-retention) of $4.6875M makes things worse. Perhaps you can trade out of those problems. Maybe Murray’s significant injury history nudges him to LTIR. Maybe a cheap buyout after 2022-23 makes this truly a one-year bet.

Still, one year might be all Dubas has. Maybe Dubas isn’t actually risking his job on Matt Murray, but it sure feels that way, and is presented that way.

Maybe not the room to make scorched earth decisions that hurt Dubas in the future, or a potential replacement?

Again, that’s where this situation could get really interesting.

Look throughout both long-term and recent NHL history with GMs on the hot seat. In many cases, those GMs make desperate moves that set the next GM up with serious messes.

Maybe a tight salary cap situation actually keeps Dubas from throwing Hail Mary interceptions that would put a potential replacement in bad field position. Either way, this team isn’t saddled with a ton of bad contracts that stretch far into the future.

Potential near-future decisions for whoever runs the Maple Leafs

So, that opens up room to operate for whoever’s calling the shots. You can look at decisions in the frame of when contracts expire/when players are eligible for extensions.

There are still some immediate questions to answer. Rasmus Sandin may require salary cap gymnastics, or even a pragmatic trade.

Quite a few depth players approach contract years. Michael Bunting, 26, appears headed for a big raise. Ilya Samsonov, 25, could raise his stock as a pending RFA. The Maple Leafs may appreciate certain deals coming off the books, such as Alexander Kerfoot. (The 27-year-old is a nice player, but maybe extravagant at $3.5M, at least when every dollar counts.)

Plenty of significant deals expire after 2023-24, so the 2023 offseason could provide crucial clarity. The Maple Leafs may decide to extend both Matthews and Nylander. Three aging defensemen see contracts expire after 2023-24: Mark Giordano, Jake Muzzin, and T.J. Brodie. Naturally, Toronto could move on from Muzzin and/or Brodie to make other future moves, as both cost $5M+. Muzzin’s health issues may also eventually become LTIR material. Either way, it’s possible there could be an eventual changing of the guard on defense.

Two Lightning-rod contracts (both essentially around $11M AAVs) expire after 2024-25: John Tavares and Mitch Marner. If the Maple Leafs keep but don’t extend Matthews and Nylander before their deals expire, Toronto could grapple with a potential Marner extension during the same 2024 offseason where they may also go through some UFA drama with Matthews and/or Nylander. For all we know, there could also be rumblings about Tavares sticking around on a “hometown discount.”

Interestingly, there’s one other wrinkle to either Dubas or a replacement GM having future flexibility to tweak or maintain the Maple Leafs.

Few of these big names have no-trade or no-movement clauses. (At least the forwards; Rielly, Muzzin, Brodie, and Justin Holl all have at least no-trade clauses.)

None of Matthews, Marner, or Nylander have no-trade clauses. Tavares is the big exception, as he has a flat-out no-movement clause. So Dubas — or a Dubas replacement — could carry more power in trading out core pieces if the Maple Leafs decide that the group is rotten.

A pivot would probably make more sense than a total change, but flexibility is nice

To reiterate: Matthews, Marner, and Nylander needing new deals soon likely leans closer to “bad” than “good.” (Instead of complaining about those cap hits, fans should probably cross their fingers that future deals look similar.)

Still, many are understandably running low on patience. While you’re not going to land players like Matthews and Marner often — even top prospects the last few years haven’t looked close — the frustration of falling a Game 7 or three short of playoff series wins can gnaw at your patience.

The Maple Leafs don’t have everything locked in place, which could end up a negative. But at least they’re not stuck if they want to shift gears."

An already-noteworthy Penguins defenseman trade involving John Marino and Ty Smith was apparently just part of the puzzle. Following a trade headlined by Michael Matheson going to the Canadiens and Jeff Petry heading to Pittsburgh, the Penguins larger defensive shuffling comes into focus.

It also only hammers home something that was already true. The Penguins and Father Time are primed for an epic battle over the next few (several?) years.

Penguins trade for: Jeff Petry (34, $6.25 million cap hit through 2024-25) and Ryan Poehling (25, $750K for one season)

Canadiens receive: Mike Matheson (28, $4.875M through 2025-26) and a 2023 fourth-round pick.

Petry trade continues theme: Penguins are going big, and going old

John Marino is a 25-year-old right-handed defenseman with strong defensive results and mixed offense that’s trended downward lately. He’s fairly cheap ($4.4M), which could be especially appealing if you agree, as his contract runs through 2026-27.

Matheson is quite a bit younger than Petry, too. In the end, the Penguins swapped out Matheson (left-handed) and Marino (right-handed) for Ty Smith (left-handed reclamation project) and Petry (right-handed).

But age is the more interesting factor than handedness (which, it must be said, teams sometimes obsess about with defensemen).

Both Petry and Sidney Crosby are 34, while Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang are 35. For every 27-year-old Jake Guentzel, there’s another 30-year-old in a prominent spot, like Bryan Rust or Brian Dumoulin.

By name recognition alone, Jeff Petry is the biggest piece in these interconnected trades. The Penguins are banking on him maintaining a high level play, even as he’s slipped from borderline-Norris-material to “just” very, very good.

Jeff Petry, traded to PIT, is a veteran offensive defenceman who loves to shoot the puck and scores quite often. Decent transition player and a strong rush defender. Keep him off the powerplay. #LetsGoPens pic.twitter.com/L6FJHuie7Q — JFresh (@JFreshHockey) July 16, 2022

If things trend the wrong way, the Penguins could look devastatingly old in rapid fashion. If Petry gives the Penguins a bigger push in the short-term, they’re probably OK with long-term pain.

Via Cap Friendly, the Matheson – Petry – Smith – Marino swaps leave the Penguins with about $2M in salary cap space.

They also may still have a glut of defensemen:

The Penguins still have nine D. Asked if another trade could be coming, GM Ron Hextall said ""Not necessarily."" — Mike DeFabo (@MikeDeFabo) July 16, 2022

Canadiens extract Matheson out of Petry trade rather than futures

Let’s be honest: sometimes you find a gem in the fourth round. It’s just not very likely.

(Three of the four defensemen in these trades were drafted in either the first or second round, while John Marino was selected 154th overall in 2015.)

Honestly, in picturing most Jeff Petry trade scenarios, I pictured the Canadiens snagging something like a first-rounder or a quality prospect off of a fairly big-name, right-handed defenseman. Instead, the focus was on a younger defenseman.

Matheson, 28, is younger and cheaper, although his contract lasts for an additional season. At first, I assumed the Canadiens got lured in by an unusually good season from Matheson.

Matheson's coming off a very good season. He has one longer of term vs. Petry, but at a lower cost. Choices were made by Pittsburgh today. pic.twitter.com/rO3wvWlQrq — Shayna (@hayyyshayyy) July 16, 2022

Upon further research, the two compare closely over a three-year sample, actually. Consider this three-year RAPM chart comparison of Petry and Matheson from Evolving Hockey:

Fascinating.

Big-picture wise, I believe the Canadiens should be skewing even younger. In fact, I’ve been taken aback by the Canadiens balking at offers to trade away a problem contract like that of Josh Anderson.

However, if Matheson is close to the player Petry is now — and different measures, including “the eye test” may inspire differing opinions — then this can still be a sensible trade for the Canadiens. Again, he’s considerably younger, and if you like the contract, then you’re covered for four seasons.

It’s also possible that the Habs aren’t done yet. The Canadiens are tight to the salary cap, and that’s with Kirby Dach as an RFA.

With the Habs signing Rem Pilick for $1.1M x 2 per @EricEngels, we now show the club with $1.25M in cap space with a roster of 21 (13F – 6D – 2G) RFAs:

Devils trade for: John Marino (25, $4.4 million cap hit through 2026-27)

With Marino trade, Devils could end up with strong right-side defense

Curiously, the Devils are a team that possesses at least one (relative) strength that other teams seek out: right-handed/right-side defensemen.

In this case, the Devils move out a young right-handed defenseman who struggled (especially in 2021-22) for a more established RHD in John Marino.

While the Devils boast a fancy stats dynamo — almost curiously so — in Jonas Siegenthaler on the left, the rest of their most noteworthy defensemen play on the right: Dougie Hamilton, Marino, and Damon Severson.

In the cases of Hamilton (29, $9 million cap hit through 2027-28) and now Marino, the Devils are paying out significant term and money for those defensemen. Severson’s situation is cloudier, as the 27-year-old carries a $4.16667M cap hit — but just for next season.

Although it likely stings to miss out on Johnny Gaudreau (for whatever reason[s]), the Devils have been active this offseason. Between Ondrej Palat and Marino, they’ve added $10.4M and some support to their roster.

Marino brings quite a bit to the table.

Here are John Marino's microstats from the 2021-22 season, courtesy of AllThreeZones: pic.twitter.com/lVWez00wmu — JFresh (@JFreshHockey) July 16, 2022

Penguins clear cap space to eventually trade for Petry

After tensions rose, the Penguins convinced Evgeni Malkin to stick around. Even with all of Malkin, Kris Letang, and Bryan Rust taking less in salary cap terms than they (likely) would’ve fetched as free agents, the Penguins still likely realized that those retentions would mean someone else would be out.

(Really, they might have viewed their defense that way even without those signings.)

That became even clearer when the Penguins somewhat-surprisingly signed Jan Rutta to a three-year deal with a $2.75M cap hit.

Eventually, it wasn’t just John Marino who shuffled out. The Penguins used that space and a Mike Matheson trade to add Jeff Petry. Understandably, Ty Smith may feel like an afterthought in all of these moves, but he could be interesting too.

A reclamation project in Smith?

From Justin Schultz to John Marino himself, the Penguins display a recent history of getting the most out of intriguing-if-struggling defensemen. Maybe they can work that magic again with Smith?

Smith, 22, carries some pedigree as the 17th pick of the 2018 NHL Draft.

Alarmingly, Smith sunk as a sophomore after a reasonably promising rookie season. That can be seen in many ways, including Smith’s ice time slipping from 20:07 per night in 2020-21 to just 17:30 per game last season.

Rookie season was better but Smith played like he had no confidence in his game last year. Knocked off the puck constantly & botched a lot of routine plays. https://t.co/ERmowqeVDc — Corey Sznajder (@ShutdownLine) July 16, 2022

Yet, the primary goal of the Marino trade was to gain salary cap space for the Penguins. If they can unlock some untapped potential in Ty Smith, it could be a really nice move.

As it stands, this seems like strong work by New Jersey, and Pittsburgh deal with cap realities."

Really, it shouldn’t be annoying when they operate like most other NHL teams — meaning, often with a lack of imagination and innovation. But it is.

Look, the Seattle Kraken team-building strategy us especially nerdy types had in our heads may never have been truly realistic. And, considering a wonderful 2022 NHL Draft haul highlighted — but not limited to — Shane Wright, the Kraken might just pull off the unlikely. Maybe they really can enjoy competitive teams today, and still build up the sort of prospect pool that will reach greater heights tomorrow.

Still, it feels like the Kraken could’ve been even bolder with a short-term pain, long-term gain strategy.

At the moment, it’s hard to shake the feeling that the Kraken are spending a lot of money for a team that mainly just looks … OK. That might sound nice, but it could be a lot less desirable if they’ve doomed themselves to puck purgatory. They could very well be too good for a 2023 NHL Draft that is getting hype for being tide-turning, and they may also not be good enough to matter. (Thus, they might not even make the playoffs.)

That could be about as underwhelming as a Pirates sequel that takes place in space because everyone truly ran out of ideas.

Kraken continue growing tradition of mixed-bag free agent moves

Last offseason, it was already a little frustrating that the Kraken passed on opportunities to weaponize salary cap space at the expansion draft. Trades that happened just after the expansion draft showed there was some runway for such tinkering, even if GMs “learned some lessons.”

(Let’s be honest: every year, free agency casts serious doubts over how much GMs “learn.”)

Most prominently, the Kraken added Andre Burakovsky (27 years old, $5.5 million cap hit through 2026-27). In a vacuum, that deal made some sense. Most promisingly, Burakovsky adds an element of offensive dynamism that the Kraken sorely lack.

A touch rich for Burakovsky, but a terrific fit for the Kraken who desperately need offensive firepower. pic.twitter.com/j46N2c2E5A — dom (@domluszczyszyn) July 13, 2022

Yet, even that Burakovsky contract feels less appealing when you ponder the larger state of the Kraken. Ask yourself: they were an Andre Burakovsky away from … what, exactly?

It’s certainly not the worst contract. As plausible as it is that Burakovsky may look worse without superstar Avalanche teammates, he may also really light it up as a go-to option. But it still looks like the sort of contract you sign when you’re knocking on the door for a Stanley Cup, not maybe climbing into the playoff bubble.

So far, the other Kraken free agent moves inspire reactions between “meh” and “why are you actively lighting money on fire?”

In a baffling move, they signed Justin Schultz, 32, to a two-year deal with a $3.2 million cap hit.

Yes, it’s noteworthy that Chris Driedger is injured. Spending $2M on Martin Jones still feels odd.

Pile those deals on some rather uninspiring contracts already on the Kraken books.

Is a bloated “middle class” the right way to go?

Jaden Schwartz is a nice player. He’s also 30, deals with injury issues, and costs $5.5M for four more seasons. Jordan Eberle’s 32, and costs that much for two seasons. Yanni Gourde, 31, is another pretty good forward at $5.167M through 2024-25.

Burakovsky and Jared McCann are nice players, and at least they’re in their prime (Burakovsky’s 27, McCann is 26). Alexander Wennberg remains a less desirable expenditure, as it sure feels like you could replicate the 27-year-old’s production for the less than his $4.5M cap hit (through 2023-24).

Ponder the group of Schwartz, Gourde, Eberle, Burakovsky, McCann, and Wennberg. Not bad, but not exactly keeping goalies and defensive-minded coaches up at night, either? It doesn’t seem like the most exciting way to invest more than $31M in salary cap space, which lurks over $35M when you add Joonas Donskoi. (Then add the polarizing-because-of-price expansion draft snag of Brandon Tanev, 30, and $3.5M for three more seasons.)

Unfortunately, the spending doesn’t look that different on defense and in net, either.

Scroll up and down the Kraken’s roster and ask yourself: how many of those contracts would you really want?

Maybe the Kraken would cringe at the idea of trying to snag futures for problem contracts such as that of James van Riemsdyk, Blue Jackets such as Jakub Voracek/Gustav Nyquist, or even Milan Lucic. It’s unclear if those players (aside from Lucic) would be that out of place on an already-disheveled looking roster.

You may say that Kraken structure looks like a sea beast, or a creaky boat quite vulnerable to the challenging tides of an NHL season. (Or … sea beast.)

Kraken could still figure this out, though

On the same day that the Devils leaned a bit too gleefully into blaming their goalies, it’s fair to confront elephant in the room. Yes, the Kraken’s goaltending dragged their overall outlook down in 2020-21.

By Hockey Viz’s count, Grubauer, Driedger, and the Kraken goaltending crew as a whole allowed about 31 goals more than expected.

The Kraken’s (not-totally-outrageous) hope is that, while Philipp Grubauer may not be Vezina finalist material every year, he may not also be the opposite. (Too soon to say “Martin Jones late in his Sharks days”-level?)

Last season, the Kraken played like a team that would be a black hole for offense for both teams. With weak finishing on their side and that really bad goaltending, the Kraken instead were a black hole for Seattle fans hoping to see a good hockey team right away.

If you get more saves, play strong defense, and sprinkle in some goals from Burakovsky/others, maybe that’s a decent team. Perhaps even a playoff factor.

Building toward a promising harvest

The real thing to be most excited about is the future, though.

Shane Wright and Matty Beniers both project as heady two-way centers. The team already has some quirky prospects to get (maybe too) excited about, such as the impeccably-named Jagger Firkus.

They also have the fuel to deepen that prospect base even more. Right now, the Kraken have their full array of seven 2023 NHL Draft picks along with two extra second-rounders, one extra third, two additional fourths, and an extra sixth. There are some extras for the 2024 NHL Draft already, too.

For the best chance to thrive, the Kraken probably should’ve geared up for a subtle or even blatant tank (maybe debate Fail Hard for Bedard vs. other rhyme schemes). Along with that, it would’ve been nice to aim for the sort of creative trades that could make the Coyotes interesting over time.

(On a similar note: it’s fair to ask if the Kraken should be cautious about either preserving or burning Shane Wright’s entry-level contract, as other high picks have sometimes struggled to justify immediate jumps.)

As is, the Kraken are at least showing potential new fans that they’re going to take some shots. With almost $10M remaining in salary cap space, the Kraken could conceivably do even more.

That may not be the optimal route, but the Kraken are doing things their way. Perhaps that way will begin to look more promising starting in 2022-23?"

It was a young team, down in the standings with a lot of talent.","NEWARK, N.J. — While thrilled to have signed two-time Stanley Cup champion Ondrej Palat in free agency, Devils general manager Tom Fitzgerald briefly felt star attraction Johnny Gaudreau would be returning to New Jersey.

It didn’t work out that way. “Johnny Hockey” chose the Columbus Blue Jackets over his home state, and the Devils gobbled up clutch and steady Palat hours later with a five-year, $30 million contract.

Fitzgerald had no regrets Friday in discussing opening days of free agency and a couple of trades. Besides Palat, the Devils signed veteran defenseman Brandan Smith and acquired center Erik Haula from Boston and goaltender Vitek Vanecek from Washington, adding to a young team led by Jack Hughes and Nico Hischier.

According to several reports, New Jersey offered Gaudreau a seven-year contract worth more than $9 million annually. He accepted a $68.5 deal with the Blue Jackets — which averaged out to $9.75 million a season.

Fitzgerald admitted to having visions of Gaudreau skating in the team’s red, white and blacks colors. And he had good reason. He knew the player and his wife. His son played with Gaudreau at Boston College and roomed with Matty Gaudreau, Johnny’s brother. They hit it off in negotiations.

“I felt that we were going to be a destination for him, but I’m guessing so were other teams that were in on him,” Fitzgerald said. “We put our best foot forward.”

When Gaudreau said yes to Columbus, the Devils quickly inked Palat, who spent his first 10 seasons with the Tampa Bay Lightning.

Palat had sensed all season the Lightning were not going to re-sign him because of their salary cap restrictions, so he prepared himself and his family for that eventuality.

The Czech forward said the Lightning never made him a new contract offer, although the team spoke with his agent about possible terms and money.

“It just wouldn’t work,” Palat said of the numbers.

While sad to be leaving Tampa, Palat said coming to New Jersey, which had not made the postseason since 2018, reminds him of his early days in with the Lightning. It was a young team, down in the standings with a lot of talent. They evolved into a team that won the Stanley Cup in 2020 and ’21 and went to the final this past season before losing to Colorado in six games.

“When you win the Stanley Cup, once you want to win again,” Palat said. “So it’s not like I don’t want to win. I just really like the team. And I believe in this New Jersey team that they’re young and they can do something special.”

Over the past few seasons, Fitzgerald has brought experienced, tough players who know how to win to New Jersey to round out the club. Last year, he signed defenseman Dougie Hamilton and brought in veteran Tomas Tatar, one of the players Palat knows well as a fellow countryman.

New Jersey’s young core took major steps last season, with Hughes, Hischier, Jesper Bratt, Dawson Mercer and Yegor Sharangovich making significant strides.

Vanecek should stabilize an injury-riddled goaltending corps. New Jersey used seven goalies last season in a year without Mackenzie Blackwood and Jonathan Bernier for much of the season.

Fitzgerald also strengthened his coaching staff, adding Andrew Brunette as an associate coach Friday. A former teammate in Nashville, the 48-year-old became the interim coach with the Panthers last season and led them to the Presidents’ Trophy with 58 wins — the most in franchise history. He finished second in the voting for the Jack Adams Award as the NHL’s top coach.

Brunette should help the Devils dreadful power play, which was fifth-worst in the league last season.

“I think this is a team that is is ready to to take that next step,” Fitzgerald said."

How much might DeBrincat, Stützle, and defensive upgrades cost?
Look at a Stützle – Norris 5-on-5 RAPM comparison from Evolving Hockey, and you’ll note that they even drive play in similar ways.","During previous offseasons, people understandably joked about the Senators being “cheap.” Plenty of smaller moves followed that pattern, too. With some incredibly promising and deeply unexpected moves in free agency/trades, the Senators flipped that script this summer.

However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’ve dropped every organizational strategy or blueprint.

Amusingly enough, while the Senators have pinched pennies on a year-to-year basis, they’ve also curiously inspired a thought. (At least, personally.)

“Hmm, they’re sure paying full price and giving plenty of long-term contracts to their young players.”

Such a thought re-entered my skull when the Senators signed Josh Norris to a beefy eight-year, $63.6 million contract on Thursday. This latest contract is just the most recent piece to a puzzle that mostly looks promising, but carries at least a few red flags.

Here’s why.

Signing young players to value contracts (or luck into rookie contract windows) can really help teams open up windows for success

Allow me to share another personal belief. Building a Stanley Cup contender isn’t just about finding talented players, and getting the most out of them. It’s also about picking your spots about how you use your salary cap space. Eventually, the bill comes along for top talent, and often the supporting cast members who put you over the top.

But there’s real value in opening windows — even small ones — where you get more than what you pay for from key players.

The Penguins won their first Stanley Cup of the Sidney Crosby era while Evgeni Malkin and Jordan Staal were still under their rookie contracts. Alex DeBrincat‘s former team the Blackhawks won their first of three Stanley Cups in the final year of rookie deals for Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane.

Of course, few teams will be able to line up entry-level contracts with peak opportunities to win Stanley Cups. But we’ve seen plenty of contenders eye value. The Avalanche bought low on the likes of Valeri Nichushkin, Nazem Kadri, and Devon Toews (among others), lining up advantages for a period of time.

Sure, it stinks to eventually lose some of those extra players who possibly gave you that additional push. Yet, spry contenders figure things out. Look at the Lightning, a franchise that gained some real value stretches from key players before they had to pay up (and make painful cuts).

In other words, you can travel to great places with “bridge” contracts, even if it opens up some uncertainty at the end of the tunnel.

For example: now-former Blackhawk Alex DeBrincat will finish his bridge contract this year, when his $6.4 million contract expires with the Senators. Clearly, Chicago couldn’t take advantage of that bargain. But that was to no fault of DeBrincat, who was easily worth that $6.4 million.

Senators have instead opted to skip the ‘bridge’ contract process

For better or worse (my guess: better and worse), the Ottawa Senators have generally skipped those “bridge” contracts. In some prominent cases, core players jumped from rookie contracts to whoppers.

Between Chabot, Tkachuk, Norris, and Batherson, that’s a touch less than $30 million in mostly-long-term investments.

Overall, it feels like something of an organizational strategy. Up front, there’s a lot of sense to it, too. From Erik Karlsson to Mark Stone all the way down to older examples like Dany Heatley, the Senators experienced heartbreak after heartbreak when it came to losing important players.

By locking up so many players through 2027-28 or even 2029-30, that’s not much of a worry.

That said, it could make it trickier to keep other pieces together.

How much might DeBrincat, Stützle, and defensive upgrades cost?

If you’re like me, when the Senators pulled off the surprising Alex DeBrincat trade, your mind shifted (probably too quickly) to the doubtful side. Sure, DeBrincat costs $6.4M now, but he’s set up for big money starting next season. What if he wants out of Ottawa, anyway?

The general answer to that is: the Senators would have options to move on if needed. And, failing that, there’s a very real element of “You need to spend money, to make money.” At the absolute minimum, the Sens are showing that they aren’t just going to sit idly by in trying to exit their rebuild.

But … yeah, it does seem like things are getting expensive, and could get downright exorbitant.

In the event that Alex DeBrincat stays, it’s hard to fathom him not becoming the most expensive Senators player. The cheapest scenario seems like it would be DeBrincat matching Brady Tkachuk’s $8.2M cap hit. (Disclaimer: Johnny Gaudreau was expected to get more than he did, especially with Columbus, so there’s always room for chaos.)

Getting paid peer pressure

To me, the most interesting Senators wildcard isn’t DeBrincat, actually. Instead, it’s the No. 3 pick of the 2020 NHL Draft, rapidly improving center, and chuckle-buddy of Brady Tkachuk: Tim Stützle.

What's better than this? Just guys being dudes 😎 pic.twitter.com/NjMUGKgZvx — TSN (@TSN_Sports) February 24, 2021

It’s logical and better that Evolving Hockey models its contract projections based on league-wide comparisons. Yet, one wonders about the potentially large influence of what players on someone’s team makes.

Back in the wilderness era of the Avalanche, $6M felt like something of a benchmark/personal dispute for Matt Duchene and Ryan O'Reilly. Maybe it even nudged Nathan MacKinnon closer to that range (the biggest factor being MacKinnon’s brief puck luck issues, of course).

By signing John Tavares to that $11M deal, did the Maple Leafs bring on challenges? Both Mitch Marner and especially Auston Matthews could point to that $11M, and at least argue they were worth something in that neighborhood.

It’s possible that Sidney Crosby’s 87 fixation not just kept his cap hit artificially low, but also kept Evgeni Malkin in that general stratosphere ($8.7M as well from 2009-10 to 2013-14; $9.5M from 2014-15 through last season). It’s unlikely coincidental that Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane carrying match $10.5M cap hits that expire after the same (2022-23) season.

With those situations in mind, and DeBrincat likely in line for at least the same $8M minimum if he stays with the Senators, then what about Tim Stützle? Wouldn’t he feel slighted if they tried a bridge deal with him after not even doing so with Norris?

Don’t get this wrong, Norris could very well end up worth $8M-ish. He just feels like someone who maybe still needs to prove that he’s a true core player, but now he’s getting paid as such.

Josh Norris can score a lot and he got paid for that service. It's a bit of an overpayment (especially as an RFA), but with an expected value of two wins per season, Norris has plenty of potential to grow into this deal. pic.twitter.com/IwNLQAbe1n — dom (@domluszczyszyn) July 14, 2022

If you’re Tim Stützle, how could you not want an explanation if the Senators get trigger-happy on a long-term, $8M-ish contract after they handed out quite a few in that range?

Look at a Stützle – Norris 5-on-5 RAPM comparison from Evolving Hockey, and you’ll note that they even drive play in similar ways. (And the younger Stützle, in particular, is in that stage of his career where he’s making real season-to-season gains as a more polished overall player.)

Last season, Norris scored more goals (35 to 22) while Stützle generated three more points (58 to 55). Again, Stützle is younger, and has higher draft pedigree. He’d have a credible argument for asking for the same money and term.

Maybe the Senators could boldly say “sorry, we can’t.” But it seems like a potentially challenging conundrum.

Especially when you add DeBrincat, likely the richest contract if he stays. That belt gets even tighter if the Senators trade for a defenseman like MacKenzie Weegar (also cheap now but needing a new contract after 2022-23) or Jeff Petry (who’d carry similar costs as Claude Giroux, and at the same age of 34).

The pessimistic size blurts out: “The Senators sure feel like they’re spending like a contending team without a guarantee that they’ll even be good.”

There are worse problems to have — the Senators know that all too well

However, the optimistic side should be heard, loud and clear.

For one thing, the Senators really have faced the threat of losing all of the (hopefully) blue-chip prospects they’ve locked down. Logically enough, the Senators may have felt that it was worth paying a premium to keep core players signed through their primes.

Tkachuk’s 22, Norris is 23, DeBrincat is just 24, Chabot’s still young at 25, and Stützle is remarkably advanced at 20. There are other intriguing players in the pipeline. Some (Jake Sanderson, 20) inspire more recent optimism than others (Erik Brännström) but you can picture scenarios where quite a few of those prospects pan out. Maybe those are the players the Senators try to squeeze cheap “bridge” years out of?

Getting better on defense is crucial, and easier said than done. Even so, perhaps Senators coach D.J. Smith could evoke teams like the 2021-22 Panthers in guiding a team that simply creates much more offense than it gives up?

Those circumstances only make MacKenzie Weegar — a key catalyst for the Panthers relentless transition attack — an even more exciting potential addition.

For sure, there’s a part of me that wonders if the Senators may suffer from a severe lack of flexibility if they realize that their promising pieces need that extra (expensive) “oomph.”

That’s particularly true in an Atlantic Division that could be even tougher if the mainstays remain great, and the Red Wings take big steps of their own. Despite some lingering concerns about the team’s structure, this much is clear: the Senators really do have a lot to be excited about."

It has left the Islanders in a state of mediocrity and it is tough to see a short-term path for exiting it.","The 2021-22 season did not go anywhere near as planned for the New York Islanders.

After back-to-back trips to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Islanders entered the season with sky-high expectations, and reasonably so. They had a top head coach, two outstanding goalies, and a team that had shown it could win in the playoffs.

But everything that could have possibly gone wrong during the season did go wrong.

They started the season with a 13-game road trip while their new arena was completed. That road trip coincided with COVID and injury issues that absolutely decimated their roster. The end result was an 11-game losing streak that was part of a 5-10-5 start to the regular season. It put them in a hole that was pretty much impossible to climb out of in a top-heavy Eastern Conference.

Once their roster returned to normal and they actually had a chance to play some games at home, they finished the year with a much stronger record and at least a little bit closer to what should have been expected. But it still wasn’t quite good enough to get them closer than 16 points to a playoff spot. And even when looking at their final 62 games, where they went 32-27-5, that would still only be a 92-point pace over an 82-game season. That is still not at a playoff level.

That resulted in a pretty stunning head coach change that saw Barry Trotz get fired and replaced by Lane Lambert.

But the roster, for the most part, remains the same as we get go through the first week of free agency. The only major chance to this point has been trading the No. 13 overall pick in a three-team trade with Montreal and Chicago that saw the Islanders acquire Alexander Romanov. He is young and has potential and has shown flashes of ability in the NHL, but he remains a total wild card.

The Islanders should still be strong on the back end. They still have the goalies (Ilya Sorokin in particular is emerging as one of the NHL’s elite at the position) but they are desperate for offense and quickly running out of options to upgrade it as most of the top candidates have already moved.

Kevin Fiala went to Los Angeles. Alex DeBrincat and Claude Giroux went to Ottawa. Filip Forsberg stayed in Nashville while Evgeni Malkin remained in Pittsburgh. Vincent Trocheck signed with the Islanders’ top rivals in across the city. Andrew Copp and David Perron went to Detroit. Max Pacioretty went to Carolina for, quite literally, nothing. And Johnny Gaudreau? The player considered to be the best option? He chose Columbus. Even New Jersey managed to add Ondrej Palat.

The Islanders?

Complete silence.

In the short-term, it is concerning because the Islanders were already behind at least eight other teams in the Eastern Conference (including four in their own division) while several other non-playoff teams have made noticeable improvements (Detroit, Columbus).

They are quickly running out of time to find their own improvements.

Nazem Kadri is still available, and Vancouver still has not made a decision on J.T. Miller and whether or not to trade him or extend him.

Other than that, the options are already slim unless Lamoriello really pulls something out of nowhere.

Given the lack of options, it is difficult to see how the Islanders make up that ground to get back to the playoffs with what is essentially the same roster.

The long-term concern is that the Islanders are on a ticking clock with core players like Mathew Barzal and Sorokin.

Barzal is in the final year of his current bridge contract, and is one year away from potential unrestricted free agency.

Sorokin will be an unrestricted free agent at the same time. They already have 10 players on the roster over the age of 30, and several more that are quickly closing in on that number. And outside of Barzal and Sorkin, there is not really a difference-maker on the roster. There are a lot of really good players, and a handful of very good players. But nobody else that is going to keep an opposing coach awake at night going into a matchup.

If the goal is to get back to the playoffs and compete this season around Barzal and Sorokin, they really needed somebody like a Gaudreau, or a DeBrincat, or even a Pacioretty this offseason. They missed the boat on all of them. Now it looks like they are headed for a couple of years of hockey purgatory over the next couple of years.

Lamoriello’s career resume speaks for itself. He built a dynasty in New Jersey and deserves all of the credit in the world for that. But that was pre-salary cap days in the league, and his teams have struggled to maintain sustained success over several years in the cap era. And despite winning back-to-back GM of the year awards there have been some questionable moves the past few years (investing so much in the fourth line; trading Devon Toews for two second-round draft picks; missing out on everybody this offseason).

It has left the Islanders in a state of mediocrity and it is tough to see a short-term path for exiting it.

There are also teams in the NHL that know they are not very good, need to tear things down to the foundation and aggressively rip things apart for future assets.

And then there are teams like the Philadelphia Flyers — a team that seems to have no idea what they are and what direction they need to go in.

The first two groups of teams are pretty easy to accept as a fan. You know what to expect in the short-term and can adjust your expectations accordingly. But when you are in that latter group of teams, the fun simply gets sucked out of sports. And how else is there to explain the Flyers’ current situation? They have spent the past 10 years tumbling through perpetual mediocrity, missing the playoffs six times, finishing higher than third place in the division just once, and winning only a single playoff round (against a 24th ranked team in the league in the expanded playoff bubble). They are coming off of a 2021-22 season where they were not only one of the worst teams in the league, but also finished with the second-worst points percentage (.372) in franchise history.

It was, by every objective measure, an awful team with holes and question marks all over the roster.

As that mess of a season was unfolding, management talked a big game about how they were going to fix this.

The words “aggressive retool” and “blank check” were thrown around. That set pretty high expectations, and made the Flyers a potential landing spot for unrestricted free agent Johnny Gaudreau, or some other major addition.

But as we learned over the past couple of days the Flyers never actually made a push for Gaudreau. We know this, because they told us this. General manager Chuck Fletcher basically came out and said they did not pursuit Gaudreau because their salary cap situation did not allow it, and that it would have been difficult to move out the necessary contracts to create salary cap space for him.

In other words, they could not (or did not want) to do the “aggressive” part of the “aggressive retool.”

What has to make it even more frustrating for Flyers fans is that they could not make an effort to go for a difference-maker and bonafide superstar because they are paying players like Rasmus Ristolainen and Tony DeAngelo a combined $10 million in salary cap space.

That is where things truly become baffling with this team. The asset management here just does not make any sense. Let’s look at some of the most prominent roster moves over the past year.

• Last summer they traded a second-round pick (which turned out to be No. 36 overall) and a seventh-round pick simply to get rid of Shayne Gostisbehere‘s contract.

• Then they traded their 2021 first-round pick (No. 14 overall), a 2023 second-round pick (which will probably be very high), and Robert Hagg to the Buffalo Sabres for Ristolainen.

• They also traded Nolan Patrick and Philippe Myers to Nashville for defenseman Ryan Ellis. This could have been a good trade, but Ellis played just four games due to injury and nobody knows when he will return. This is bad luck. No major criticism here.

• Along with with that, they also traded Jakub Voracek for Cam Atkinson. It reduced the team’s salary cap number in the short-term, but Atkinson’s contract goes an extra year. It is pretty much a wash. Once the season became a dumpster fire, another core player, Claude Giroux, went out the door for Owen Tippett, a 2024 first-round pick, and a 2023 third-round pick.

• But then this offseason, they traded three more draft picks (second in 2024, third in 2023, and fourth in 2024) for DeAngelo and paid him $5 million per year over the next two years.

If you want to try, you might be able to justify each move individually. But as a collective it is all nonsensical. Look at the totality of those moves.

Flyers give up: No. 14 overall (2021), No. 36 overall (2022), No. 101 overall (2022), 2023 second-round pick, 2023 third-round pick, 2024 second-round pick, Gostisbehere, Voracek, Giroux, Hagg, Patrick, Myers.

Flyers receive: Atkinson, Ristolainen, Ellis, DeAngelo, Tippett, 2024 first-round pick, 2023 third-round pick.

They were willing to use draft picks to dump Gostisbehere’s contract, but then replaced him with a worse contract (Ristolainen, which required more assets to be given up).

But they were not willing to give up assets to move somebody like a James van Riemsdyk to clear space for Johnny Gaudreau.

They talked a big game about doing whatever it took to turn this around as quickly as possible, and the offseason so far has been signing Nicolas Deslauriers for four years and acquiring DeAngelo for three draft picks, who is the exact same player as Gostisbehere that they paid two draft picks to get rid of.

None of this even gets into the question marks that are already on the team. Will Travis Konecny rediscover his goal scoring touch? Will Joel Farabee eventually breakout? And what about the biggest wild card of then all, starting goalie Carter Hart?

The Flyers are clearly stuck somewhere between rebuilding, thinking they can compete, but not willing to make any of the moves in either direction. At some point you have to pick a direction and follow it. That makes for a bleak situation and what could be a very long, frustrating season.

Probably multiple seasons.

The Stars forward lost in a second playoff hole to Tony Romo to give the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback his third victory at the event, which takes place annually at Edgewood Tahoe South in Stateline, Nevada where the NHL played two outdoor games in 2021.

Pavelski was one of a hundred athletes and entertainers to take part in the three-day event. Golf is a big passion for the Stars forward. In the 2021-22 NHLPA players’ poll, his fellow players believe he could make it a professional golfer. He’s finished second, sixth, 11th, third, 12th, and 10th, respectively, in the six times he’s participated in the Tahoe tournament.

When Pavelski is done playing hockey, he says he would consider going the Romo route and attempting to qualify for high-level golf tournaments.

“Yeah, I think it’d be fun to get out and play a little bit more competitive golf,” Pavelski told NBC Sports before the tournament started. “You always come to this Tahoe event and you get on that first tee and you’re like ‘Dang, I wish I would have done this a couple of times’ as far in the competition. Playing with your buddies gets you ready and there’s a lot of razzing going on and some money games. I love competitive golf and tournament golf. It’s funny how the mind can switch on you a little bit there.”

We spoke with Pavelski about his golfing prowess, playing for Peter DeBoer once again, and what made his line with Roope Hintz and Jason Robertson work so well.

Enjoy.

Q. You’ve done real well at this tournament in the past. I know the NHL schedule has been all over the place the last few years but are you able to get out and play during the season or do you primarily get out there during the off-seasons?

PAVELSKI: “I try to get out when I can. Being in Dallas now has helped with the winter time and the schedule you’re able to get out. It’s not super warm in the middle of winter down there but you can catch the right day and have a pretty nice day on the course. I like to think I like to get out to play a round once every three weeks. Some weeks are better than others. There’s months you don’t play at all and then there’ll be a week you get out a couple of times on a good homestand. We get to the club a little bit more than that, try to get out there once a week and just hit balls a little bit or going and playing a few holes with [my son], it’s nice to get out there.”

Q. Who’s the worst golfer on the Dallas Stars?

PAVELSKI: “There’s some bad guys and I think they know it so they just don’t play. We’ve got a good crew. [Jake Oettinger] is pretty good, Jamie Benn, [Tyler] Seguin, [Joel] Hanley, [John] Klingberg. I like to battle with Klinger quite a bit. [Ben Bishop]. I actually really like this group as far as that goes. There’s a lot of guys that are up for a round of two.”

Q. So no one with a Charles Barkley swing?

PAVELSKI: “No. To be honest, I don’t know if I’d play with them [Laughs]. Why waste my time? I haven’t seen it. There’s some bad swings, I’m sure.”

Q. Moving on to the Stars, did Jim Nill reach out to get your thoughts about Peter as he was going through the process of finding the next head coach?

PAVELSKI: “There were some questions. I was always open. I really enjoyed him as a head coach. I thought he had a great staff. We had a good thing in San Jose, so a lot of trust in the message he’s always given us as a group. When I was with him and watching his teams from far away, you knew he was doing a good job. [I’m] definitely excited. When they did bring that name up I tried to answer the questions. I never thought I’d probably play for him again, to be honest. He was in a pretty good spot there in Vegas and doing a good job. It’s funny how things work out and I’m excited for the opportunity for sure.”

Q. When Rick Bowness stepped away did you reach out to Jim and throw Peter’s name out there after he became available?

PAVELSKI: “It was definitely one of those conversations that you just had a feel that chances were pretty good. And I think Pete was on a lot of team’s radars. I definitely gave him some support for what that’s worth. They go through their process and narrow things down. It was good to see that he was at the top of their list and we were able to get him.”

Q. You had four of your most productive seasons under Peter in San Jose. What was it about his system that suited your game and best?

PAVELSKI: “It’s got a lot of good pieces to it. I don’t want to say it’s a simple system, but it’s clear. You have an understanding of what you’re trying to do on the forecheck, breakouts, stuff like that. There’s some good pieces put in place for the D-zone and breaking the puck out which allowed us to spread the ice at time and generate some speed and gapping, creating opportunities that way.”

Q. His style allows for a lot of shots from the point, right? That’s going to be huge for you and your tipping ability again.

PAVELSKI: “Yeah, it helps. Whatever system you’re playing there’s a certain level that you just have to go figure it out. I had some great years in Dallas with Rick. Whatever style it is you get a certain onus on the player to have that production.”

Q. Your line with Roope and Jason was incredibly productive this season at 5-on-5. What is it about their games individually that made the line click?

PAVELSKI: “My game, I see the ice and think the game well. It’s one of my strengths, it’s something I lean on. Those two guys are very smart hockey players and they’re good with the puck and have confidence to make plays and find themselves in right positions. We just complement each other very well, especially with Roope — a big body that can skate. And Robo’s got a lot of good playmaking and some sneaky size, sneaky shot. He finds himself in a lot of good places and the puck follows him around. It has the last little bit. I’m reading off those guys and they’re reading off me. It’s just worked. It’s a fun line to play on.”

Q. You’re 38 and coming off a career-best point total. Do you have a timeframe in mind for how much longer you want to continue playing?

PAVELSKI: “No, we’re just year by year right now. No rush, we’ll figure it out as we go. I’m sure there will be questions but you just focus on what you’re doing and see how everything holds up after the season and we’ll go from there.”

They have already added Alex DeBrincat, Claude Giroux, and Cam Talbot to their roster this offseason, and on Thursday extended another one of their key players to a long-term contact extension.

The team announced that it has signed forward Josh Norris to an eight-year, $63.6 million contract extension that will begin with the 2022-23 season. That averages out to a $7.95 million salary cap hit per season. Norris entered the offseason as a restricted free agent.

He is the fourth player in this young Senators’ core to sign a long-term deal, joining Brady Tkachuk, Thomas Chabot, and Drake Batherson who are all signed through at least 2027.

Norris, 23, is coming off of a breakout season that saw him score 35 goals, 20 assists, and 55 total points in 66 games. Originally a first-round draft pick by the San Jose Sharks in 2017, the Senators acquired Norris in the 2018 trade that sent defenseman Erik Karlsson out west. That trade has turned out to be a potential franchise-changer for the Senators as it not only landed them Norris, but also the 2020 first-round pick that resulted in another of Ottawa’s key young players, Tim Stützle.

It is rare that a trade involving a superstar works out so well for the team giving up the best player, but this has gone about as well as the Senators could have hoped.

The big question on Norris is whether or not he can maintain this goal scoring pace. He has shot around 19 percent through the first two years in the league, which is a fairly high number and we only have 125 game sample size to go by here. Shooting percentages can fluctuate a bit, and if he does not maintain that current level it could cut into his production a bit. The encouraging thing is that his shot volume increased this season while his underlying possession numbers also took a step forward.

The Senators still have some holes to address on defense, and even with the addition of Talbot goaltending is a concern, but given their forward additions and overall forward depth the Senators are shaping up to be one of the most exciting teams in the league this season.

It might not result in a playoff spot, but for the first time in a few years there should be a real sense of hope for the team’s fans. If nothing else, there at least seems to be a clear direction.

Before any of the top NHL free agents had agreed to a deal this week, general manager Chuck Fletcher declared the Flyers out of contention for all of them because of “the reality of our cap situation.”

“We don’t have the cap space to pursue those high-end type of free agents,” Fletcher said. “It probably precluded us from looking at some of the more expensive options in the market.”

If that sounds depressing for Flyers fans, it is. But it was also the grim reality for a number of teams across the NHL grapping with a salary cap ceiling that rose only $1 million this year as the league rebounds from the financial impact of the pandemic. It was the first increase since 2019.

Being locked in salary cap jail prevented the Flyers from bringing home Gaudreau, the MVP-caliber star who grew up just across the river in New Jersey. Similar issues forced the Vegas Golden Knights to essentially give away six-time 30-goal scorer Max Pacioretty for nothing, and the New York Islanders were never able to really enter the Gaudreau sweepstakes.

Thing is, other teams navigated this landscape just fine.

Columbus got Gaudreau, New Jersey added two-time Stanley Cup champion Ondrej Palat and Detroit signed a handful of players by taking advantage of cap space. Some teams clearly did a much better job managing the tight market.

“If you didn’t have room or a potential to make room, you wouldn’t have this type of opportunities,” Blue Jackets GM Jarmo Kekalainen said Thursday while sitting next to Gaudreau, who signed a $68.25 million, eight-year deal with Columbus. “It’s not an easy world when you have good players. It’s a great problem to have if you have too many good players and then time comes, especially in these days when the salary cap’s been flat, that something has to give.”

[NHL free agency tracker 2022: Full list of offseason signings]

Sure, that’s the case for the 2020 and 2021 champion Tampa Bay Lightning, who watched Palat and dependable defenseman Jan Rutta depart in free agency while extending three younger members of their core.

The Flyers, on the other hand, lack high-end talent and are burdened by big-money contracts despite missing the playoffs each of the past two seasons. Gaudreau’s desire to leave Calgary and play for the team he grew up rooting for seemed to make it a natural fit, and they even started clearing room by buying out fan favorite, 25-year-old cancer survivor Oskar Lindblom.

In the end, Philadelphia couldn’t shed the $7 million final season of James van Riemsdyk’s contract or make other moves to land Gaudreau.

“You’d have to move multiple contracts to be able to do that,” Fletcher said. “You have to have a team (willing to take them). In some cases, contracts are extremely hard to move.”

Based on the $9.75 million cap hit Gaudreau agreed to with the Blue Jackets, the Flyers would have had the room had they simply decided not to double down on underachieving defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen during the season by signing him for $5 million annually, or ink Tony DeAngelo last week for the same rate after sending second-, third-, and fourth-round picks to Carolina for his rights.

The Hurricanes gladly took that draft capital and pounced when cap-strapped Vegas needed to clear space to re-sign Reilly Smith. Carolina got Pacioretty and young defenseman Dylan Coghlan for “future considerations” because Vegas was in a bind.

“We needed to create some flexibility to sign some young players in our hockey club,” Golden Knights GM Kelly McCrimmon told reporters. “We identified this as being the best path.”

Montreal GM Kent Hughes put it this way: “Heck, Carolina, picked up two pretty good hockey players for very little.”

Pacioretty’s contract having the same cap hit and length as van Riemsdyk’s made the Flyers’ inability to clear the decks for Gaudreau, Kadri, Klingberg or another top free agent stand out even more, even if the players don’t have the same track record in terms of production.

Asked about not being willing to part with a first-round pick to free up money, Fletcher said that in some cases it would have cost even more.

“I talked to a lot of teams over the last little while about maybe ways to get cap flexibility,” he said. “We looked at some different options, but the price of moving contracts is really expensive.”

More expensive in the long term might be a half-empty arena in a sports-crazy town that has become apathetic about its hockey team. The climb back to relevance is just beginning for the Red Wings, who shelled out contracts worth more than $60 million on Wednesday alone.

It’s something GM Steve Yzerman — who built up the Lightning before leaving to go back to Detroit — was able to do because he managed the cap so well. Three years ago, he decided not to spend a lot of money and picked his spot.

“We have roster spots, we have cap space — there were players there that we felt would help us and not really deviate from what we’re trying to do, but also not necessarily give maximum term and maximum dollar to players,” Yzerman said. “With the cap situation the last couple of years, it has had an effect on what some teams can do and some teams want to do.”

Or, more notably, what they might want to do but can’t. Kekalainen made sure the Blue Jackets were ready when Gaudreau was available.

“We had to crunch numbers and look at different things, and we all agreed that we just can’t pass on an opportunity like this,” he said."

The Devils were still 20 points back of the Blue Jackets and both teams lost out on Gaudreau to the Blue Jackets.
In a league where teams are afraid to take a gamble the Blue Jackets have a way of keeping things interesting.","Whether you agree or disagree with his vision and roster moves, you have to give Columbus Blue Jackets general manager Jarmo Kekäläinen credit for one thing. He is not afraid to take a risk or make every effort to improve his roster.

Wednesday’s stunning signing of unrestricted free agent Johnny Gaudreau was perhaps the biggest move of his tenure in and it has certainly raised eyebrows around the league given where Columbus finished the 2021-22 season. They were not a playoff team, nobody expected them to be major players in the free agent market (especially for Gaudreau), and there is still some debate as to how good they can actually be this season.

It is not the first time Kekäläinen and the Blue Jackets have done something like this.

Think back to the 2019 NHL trade deadline when Columbus, facing the prospect of losing Artemi Panarin and Sergei Bobrovsky after the season in unrestricted free agency, not only kept both players, but went all in by adding Matt Duchene, Ryan Dzingel, Keith Kinkaid, and Adam McQuaid in an effort to make the playoffs. They did, and then pulled off one of the most stunning upsets in Stanley Cup playoff history when they swept a record-setting Tampa Bay Lightning team in four games.

This is the offseason version of that.

In a league where most GMs and teams seem to be incredibly risk averse, Kekäläinen’s approach is a breath of fresh air for fans that like seeing teams make an effort to get better. Sometimes that is all it takes. Think back to last offseason when the Los Angeles Kings, still considered to be in a rebuild, spent big money on adding Viktor Arvidsson and Philip Danault to complement their young players. The result was a rapid improvement that put them in the playoffs ahead of schedule, while they were a close Game 7 away from actually advancing. They made an actual effort to get better, and they did.

The question here is how much better are the Blue Jackets going to be?

Columbus was a 10th-place team in the Eastern Conference this past season and is not really considered a contender. But there is still a lot of talent here.

Cole Sillinger is entering his second year and coming off of a rookie season where he scored 16 goals and 31 points as an 18-year-old.

Oliver Bjorkstrand and Gustav Nyquist are legit top-six forwards. Jack Roslovic and Boone Jenner have that ability. There are also some interesting young players like Emil Benstron and Alexandre Texier with potential.

On defense, Zach Werenski is a legitimate top-pairing defenseman while the Seth Jones trade has helped rebuild that unit around him with talented young players (Adam Boqvist, Jake Bean, and No. 6 overall pick.

Now they have a bonafide superstar and one of the league’s elite players on their roster. For a team that badly needed a star and has watched their own stars leave town one after another, this is a massive moment.

There are two wild cards that will determine what this team can do this season (and in the near future).

What happens with Patrik Laine?

This is significant.

Laine remains a restricted free agent while the Blue Jackets have just a little more than $3 million in salary cap space remaining, per Cap Friendly.

Does Laine still factor into their short-term (or long-term) plans? Or is Gaudreau seen as a replacement for him? If it is the former, a lineup that has both Laine and Gaudreau in it has the potential to be fairly dynamic. That is two stars on the roster, especially given the way Laine bounced back this year offensively.

If they are going to keep him they are going to have to move out salary somewhere to fit him under the cap. Jakub Voracek‘s $8.25 million salary cap is costly over the next two years and would be a prime candidate to move if they could find a taker.

Simply swapping out Laine for Gaudreau might be an upgrade, especially if you factor in a return on a hypothetical Laine trade, but it is probably not as big of an upgrade as having both of them on the roster together.

Goaltending

The other big X-factor for every team.

This was a big problem for the Blue Jackets during the 2021-22 season as both Elvis Merzlikins and Joonas Korpisalo struggled. The team finished in the bottom-10 of the league in both all situations and 5-on-5 save percentage, and it was a significant step backwards from what the duo has shown in the past. It is also totally understandable that both goalies struggled given the offseason death of teammate Matīss Kivlenieks. Merzlikins talked after the season how he had games where he struggled. It would be unfair to use his performance this past season as a measuring stick of what to expect moving forward. As good as professional athletes are at their jobs, they are still human.

Merzlikins does not have a huge track record in the NHL, but his first two years in the league were extremely productive. Among the 40 goalies that appeared in at least 50 games during the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons, Merzlikins’ .920 all situations save percentage was fifth best in the NHL while his .922 even-strength save percentage was 11th best.

There is every reason to believe that both he and Korpisalo can be better this season.

Based on the 2021-22 season Columbus would have a 19-point gap to make up in the playoff race to make the playoffs. That is a lot. But with better goaltending, a full season of Laine, the addition of Gaudreau, and some of their young players could help get them there.

Every year there are multiple teams that make the playoffs after missing the previous season. It is a given that it will happen. For as good as the Eastern Conference and Metropolitan Division is there are some teams that could be vulnerable. Washington is getting older and will be without some key players at the start of the season (and perhaps Nicklas Backstrom all season). Boston’s roster is a total wild card right now as nobody knows if Patrice Bergeron (or David Krejci) will be back, while they will be starting the season with multiple key players sidelined, including Brad Marchand and Charlie McAvoy. Pittsburgh is a year older with some questions.

As for their non-playoff competitors, the Islanders have lost in the dust and missed out on everybody. The Devils were still 20 points back of the Blue Jackets and both teams lost out on Gaudreau to the Blue Jackets. Detroit might be able to make a move up, but they signed a bunch of good players instead of a superstar.

It is not a given, but there is a definite path to the playoffs for Columbus and the potential is certainly there. In a league where teams are afraid to take a gamble the Blue Jackets have a way of keeping things interesting. Sometimes you just have to try. Maybe if it works other teams will follow.

Hockey Canada did not commit to releasing either the incomplete or full report to the government in its letter.
It has also requested a redacted copy of the nondisclosure agreement related to the settlement along with a long list of Hockey Canada communications.
Companies that paused or withdrew funding from Hockey Canada or specific events include Scotiabank, Telus, Tim Hortons and Imperial Oil, under its Esso brand.","TORONTO — Hockey Canada made a series of announcements on Thursday in an open letter to Canadians, including the reopening of a third-party investigation into an alleged sexual assault involving members of the country’s 2018 world junior team.

The national federation said participation in the investigation by the players in question is mandatory, adding anyone who declines will be banned from all of the federation’s activities and programs effective immediately. It previously said it “strongly encouraged” players take part in the investigation into the alleged incident, which occurred at a Hockey Canada function in London, Ontario.

Hockey Canada CEO Scott Smith, who took on the role July 1 and has held various jobs at the federation since 1995, testified on last month that “12 or 13″ of the 19 players from the team were interviewed before the original and incomplete investigation concluded in September 2020.

“We know we have not done enough to address the actions of some members of the 2018 national junior team or to end the culture of toxic behavior within our game. For that we unreservedly apologize,” Hockey Canada’s letter said. “We know we need to do more to address the behaviors, on and off the ice, that conflict with what Canadians want hockey to be, and which undermine the many good things that the game brings to our country.”

Hockey Canada quietly settled a lawsuit in May after a woman claimed she was assaulted by eight players, including members of the country’s 2018 gold-medal winning junior team. None of the allegations have been proven in court.

Smith, Hockey Canada’s then-president, and outgoing CEO Tom Renney were grilled by MPs in Ottawa last month after news of the alleged assault and settlement broke. Unhappy with what it heard from the executives, the federal government subsequently paused public funding for the national body. A number of companies also suspended sponsorships as they awaited next steps.

“We recognize many of the actions we are taking now should have been taken sooner, and faster,” Hockey Canada’s letter read. “We own that and will do better to deliver on our responsibilities to Canadians.”

Hockey Canada said it will now require players, coaches, team staff and volunteers associated with its high-performance program to participate in mandatory sexual violence and consent training.

It will also conduct a full third-party review of the organization’s governance, and is committing to become a full signatory to the Office of the Integrity Commissioner, a new government agency with the power to independently investigate abuse complaints and levy sanctions.

Hockey Canada said it will also create an “independent and confidential complaint mechanism” to provide victims and survivors tools and support to come forward.

Minister of Sport Pascale St-Onge said last month federal money would only be restored once officials produced the incomplete third-party report and became a signatory to the Office of the Integrity Commissioner. Hockey Canada received $14 million from Ottawa in 2020 and 2021, including $3.4 million in COVID-19 subsidies, according to government records.

Hockey Canada did not commit to releasing either the incomplete or full report to the government in its letter. Once the investigation is completed — by the same Toronto law firm hired in 2018 — it will be referred to “an independent adjudicative panel of current and former judges who will determine the appropriate consequences, which may include a lifetime ban from Hockey Canada activity, on and off the ice.”

The woman who made the assault allegation was seeking $3.55 million in damages from Hockey Canada, the Canadian Hockey League and the unnamed players.

“We acknowledge the courage of the young woman involved and respect her decision to participate with the investigation in the manner she chooses,” Hockey Canada wrote Thursday.

Hockey Canada has said it learned of the incident the day after it was alleged to have occurred, started to investigate and notified police.

Details of the settlement have not been publicized, but Smith testified before the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage in June that Hockey Canada came up with the funds and paid the entire sum, adding no government money was used. St-Onge ordered an audit to make sure that’s the case.

The committee is set to meet July 26 and 27 to hear from more witnesses. It has also requested a redacted copy of the nondisclosure agreement related to the settlement along with a long list of Hockey Canada communications.

The NHL is also conducting an investigation because some of the players from the team are now in the league.

This time, it did.

In a free agency stunner, Johnny Gaudreau, the top player available on the market, has signed with the Columbus Blue Jackets on a seven-year, $68.25 million contract.

That comes out to a salary cap hit of $9.75 million per season.

When it was revealed that Gaudreau would not be re-signing with the Flames and was headed to the open market. it was assumed that he might go closer to home and opt for the New Jersey Devils or New York Islanders. Maybe even the Philadelphia Flyers. But the Flyers said they never had any interest (bizarre), while the Devils and Islanders apparently could not offer Gaudreau the money or opportunity that he wanted.

As for Columbus, this just completely came out of nowhere, and it is a huge win for a franchise that has seen so many top players leave town over the years. Now, they are the ones taking somebody else’s star.

This is an elite offensive talent, one of the top scorers in the world, and the best free agent on the market, deciding to sign there over everybody else. It is a massive deal for a Blue Jackets team that has quietly been assembling some really intriguing talent.

The Seth Jones trade from a year ago has already added Cole Sillinger, Adam Boqvist, and No. 6 overall pick in 2022 David Jiříček to the organization.

Zach Werenski is a legit top-pairing defenseman, while Jakub Voracek, Gustav Nyquist, and Oliver Bjorkstrand are all very good players.

Laine next?

The wild card in all of this now is Patrik Laine. He is still unsigned as a restricted free agent and really bounced back in a big way this past season.

#CBJ say signing of Johnny Gaudreau does not preclude them from signing Patrik Laine, who is currently an RFA. They can keep them both, but other moves are now necessary. — Aaron Portzline (@Aportzline) July 13, 2022

If they can figure out a way to keep him long-term with Gaudreau, combined with the aforementioned players, this is suddenly a very interesting team. The Blue Jackets were the ninth team in the Eastern Conference this past season despite getting brutal goaltending.

This is just very unexpected. Gaudreau turned down more money from Calgary, and he seemingly had opportunities to play closer to home.

Gaudreau was by far the top player to hit the unrestricted free agent market after turning down an extremely lucrative contract offer from the Calgary Flames.

He is coming off a monster 2021-22 season that saw him finish with career highs in goals (40), assists (75), points (115), and shots on goal (272) while helping to form one of the league’s most dominant lines alongside Matthew Tkachuk. It was the perfect time for a career year. Even if he does not repeat that exact performance he should still be an elite top-line player for the foreseeable future.

Even before his career year Gaudreau has been one of the league’s best playmakers and a pretty consistent point-per-game player and there is no reason to believe he will not continue to be that for the foreseeable future.

And with that, the Hurricanes continued to load up their roster on the opening day of free agency.

The full deal will send Pacioretty and Dylan Coghlan to the Hurricanes in exchange for future considerations. That is it. Nothing going back to Vegas in return.

The key to this deal for Vegas — and the only key to this deal — is dumping the remaining year of Pacioretty’s contract ($7 million salary cap hit) to get under the cap. It is a familiar cycle for the Golden Knights as they keep adding big-name players in trade and free agency and then having to jettison other players to make it all work. Sometimes (in the case of Pacioretty and Marc-Andre Fleury) they have to jettison them for, quite literally, nothing.

When healthy Pacioretty is still an outstanding player and has scored at a point-per-game (and 40-goal pace per 82 games) the past two seasons. If Carolina had a weakness on their roster the past couple of years it has been not having enough finishers that can turn all of their possession domination into goals. They have a lot of really good players, and a team where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, but they definitely had a need for another difference-making forward.

They not only got one, they did not have to give up anything to get it.

It is Carolina’s second big trade of the deal, having also acquired defenseman Brent Burns in a trade with the San Jose Sharks.

The Hurricanes also signed Ondrej Kase to a one-year contract, while allowing Vincent Trocheck to leave in free agency to the New York Rangers. It is likely that Nino Neiderreiter is also leaving in free agency.

Those departures seem pretty insignificant when you consider the boost that Pacioretty can provide.

Carolina still has one of the best rosters in the league and managed to get a lot more lethal offensively with Pacioretty and Burns added to the mix.

As for Vegas, this is tough and it speaks to the self-inflicted salary cap headaches it constantly creates for itself by seemingly having no long-term vision beyond “sign or trade for the biggest name available.”

Coming off of a bitterly disappointing season where they missed the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the first time in franchise history, this is not an encouraging start to the offseason.

Much like their Atlantic Division-mates in Ottawa, the Red Wings are pushing hard to exit their rebuild. The multi-million dollar question is: how far along are the Red Wings after free agent signings of Ben Chiarot, Andrew Copp, and David Perron.

You can definitely throw Ville Husso in the mix, too, even though they snatched him up before he could become a UFA.

Red Wings splurge on free agents: Chiarot, Copp, Perron (and Husso, basically)

Let’s run down each move, then round back to the larger question of how far Detroit really traveled.

Ben Chiarot part of a set of questionable free agent defensemen signings

If you want a theme to go with the normal “that doesn’t seem like a good idea” vibes of most free agent years, it was that bad defensemen contracts often came in at four years. Personally, Brett Kulak resonates as the exception. His four-year deal with a $2.75M cap hit feels like the type of deal the Oilers should have focused solely on, instead of bigger gambles on Evander Kane and Jack Campbell.

The Blue Jackets’ investment in Erik Gudbranson is troubling. The Blues are banking on Nick Leddy being better than the charts say. Like those teams, the Red Wings are betting big (four years, $4.75 million cap hit) that Ben Chiarot is better than projections indicate.

Chiarot is not as bad as models suggest, but this is still way too pricey for a glorified third pair defender. pic.twitter.com/U2EyBPg8O8 — dom (@domluszczyszyn) July 13, 2022

Even if the truth is somewhere in between the fawning “eye tests” and the dicey analytics, it seems like a dangerous move. Especially for a team that still has an awful lot of work to do in adding useful defensemen beyond Moritz Seider and a select few other possible solutions.

If nothing else, other Red Wings free agent signings are easier to defend.

Nice bargain on Perron

With certain moves, the main criticism revolves around wondering if Detroit is “there” yet. David Perron headlines such a concern.

Perron is somehow 34 already. That would make a long-term contract really dicey. Wisely, the Red Wings limited the term to two years, and got a nifty bargain at just $4.75M. He checks boxes both from analytics and simple counting stats standpoints. Heck, Perron’s even done some great work in the playoffs.

David Perron (2×4.75m with Detroit) is a very useful all-around player – very helpful on the powerplay, a great finisher, good defensively. Very effective. pic.twitter.com/JOL0IHOLy7 — Micah Blake McCurdy (@IneffectiveMath) July 13, 2022

I just wonder if the Red Wings will be anything more than respectable during his two years under contract. It’s a bit surprising a more established contender didn’t knock harder on Perron’s door if the price was that reasonable.

Maybe the Red Wings can make a jump in time?

Digestible deal for Copp

Heading into 2022 NHL Free Agency, Andrew Copp carried the potential to be one of those players whose value inflated too high.

All things considered, the Red Wings made a respectable free agent investment in Copp. The 28-year-old can thrive in a number of different roles, and five-year deal ($5.625M cap hit) isn’t explosively risky.

Andrew Copp, signed 5x$5.6M by DET, is a versatile top six forward who can do pretty much whatever is asked of him at a solid enough level. Can play a shut-down role, can play a faster rush game, can play special teams, can play any forward position. #LGRW pic.twitter.com/tSbgFgOvoJ — JFresh (@JFreshHockey) July 13, 2022

It’s fair to wonder how that contract will age, though. While Chiarot’s contract personally weighs in at “bad” and Perron’s leans toward quite good, Copp trends more toward the middle. Maybe it would’ve been wiser to go younger, and cheaper, like Dylan Strome or Sonny Milano?

Ville Husso investment looks better by comparison to other moves

In 2021-22, Ville Husso often looked outstanding. That said, 57 career regular-season games (and seven bumpy playoff contests) only give you so much “data” on Husso. His numbers at other levels tailed off a bit in 2018-19 and 2019-20.

It’s possible that the Red Wings’ consecutive offseason swings at younger goalies (Alex Nedeljkovic in 2021, now Husso) may both end up being whiffs.

Sure, some of that is “the price of doing business.” But they enter 2022-23 paying that duo a combined $7.75M in salary cap terms. Spending that money isn’t really “shrug, and see what happens” material. It’s a lot closer to throwing down the gauntlet.

It’s easier to feel OK-to-good about the Red Wings’ goalie changes after seeing the Maple Leafs’ strange investment in Matt Murray and other shakier bets. Even so, these moves keep stacking the stakes higher for a Red Wings team that might not be ready for such gambles.

Will spending almost $25M pay off?

The Red Wings also added Dominik Kubalik (two years, $2.5M cap hit) and Olli Määttä (one year, $2.25M). Those aren’t moves that will radically change things either way (though Kubalik could be a nice value).

They do add to the overall costs, though.

Between Husso, Chiarot, Copp, Perron, Kubalik, and Määttä, the Red Wings added nearly $25M in salary cap/free agent commitments during this offseason. Remarkably, they still have room to add more if they’d like.

Of course, the Red Wings can’t just look at this offseason. Some cheap contracts are coming off the books soon.

Dylan Larkin‘s due a raise from his bargain $6.1M cap hit after the 2022-23 season. He’s 25 and would become a UFA.

Tyler Bertuzzi, 27, is also a pending UFA who will likely cost more than his $4.75M (even if he has to miss games voluntarily here and there).

Both Lucas Raymond and Moritz Seider have two years remaining on their rookie contracts. Their raises could be mammoth.

Now, the Red Wings aren’t poorly positioned to handle those situations. Only some of the contracts they signed could make things a little tougher down the line.

But it’s unclear if this aggressive push will be worth it. In the end, the Red Wings may wish they waited just a little longer to truly try to rise from their rebuild."

The Hurricanes will retain 33% of Burns’ remaining contract with Burns costing San Jose $2.64 million on their cap for the next three years. His contract carries an $8 million salary cap hit and runs through the 2024-25 NHL season. Carolina was reportedly one of teams on Burns’ three-team trade list.

Changes were expected in San Jose following a third straight season without playoff hockey. In May, Burns knew something had to give and didn’t shoot down the idea of moving on from the Sharks.

“It’s definitely tough when you lose three years, not making the playoffs,” he said. “I think everybody feels that way, whether they’re young or older. At the end of the day, that’s what we all play for. I’ve been in the league long enough to know that, when you’re doing these meetings at this time, there’s a lot of changes that happen, that need to happen.

[NHL free agency tracker 2022: Full list of offseason signings]

“A lot of changes are going to happen here. When you’re looking for a new general manager, there’s a lot of things on the table. So I don’t know.”

With Tony DeAngelo now in Philadelphia, there was a need for the Hurricanes to add a right-side defenseman. John Klingberg, an unrestricted free agent, was rumored to be a possibility but in the end general manager Don Waddell went with Burns.

Burns had been one of the Sharks’ highest volume shooters over the last four seasons, something that should allow him to fit in nicely on the Hurricanes’ blue line. Carolina is a team that likes to shoot the puck and that should help the 37-year-old stay productive coming off a 10-goal, 54-point season.

Grier gets to work

A week after taking over as GM, Mike Grier has begun remodeling the Sharks. With Burns gone, it now leaves Erik Karlsson and Marc-Édouard Vlasic as the two richest contracts on the roster. Karlsson has five years and $51 million owed to him ($11.5M cap hit) while Vlasic ($7M cap hit) has four years and $27 million in salary left on his deal.

With Burns gone, Grier now has a little under $13 million in cap space, per Cap Friendly. Kaapo Kähkönen and Mario Ferraro are among the main restricted free agents to re-sign, which should still leave him plenty of room to continue to add minus any other cap-opening trades.

but this is going to take some serious salary cap gymnastics.","It is time for the Tampa Bay Lightning’s yearly game of “the salary cap doesn’t really matter all that much.”

The team announced on Wednesday that it has signed defenseman Mikhail Sergachev and Erik Cernak, as well as forward Anthony Cirelli, to eight-year contracts.

All three players have one year remaining on their current deals and were eligible to sign new extensions on Wednesday. The Lightning wasted no time in doing so.

Sergachev’s deal is the largest of the three, coming in at a total of $68 million. That is a salary cap hit of $8.5 million per season.

Cirelli’s deal is for $50 million ($6.5 million salary cap hit) while Cernak’s contract comes in at $41.6 million ($5.2 million salary cap number).

Along with those contracts, they also signed veteran defenseman Ian Cole to a one-year, $3 million contract.

The three extensions, though, are the big headlines here. These are all monster deals and keep with Tampa Bay’s trend of paying to keep their core players on maximum term contracts. Sergachev’s is the most intriguing because it seems like he has been around forever but he is still only 24 years old (having just turned 24!) and probably still has his best days ahead of him. If he reaches his full potential this could be a really good deal for the Lightning because it is paying for what should be his prime years.

In 78 regular season games this season he scored seven goals with 31 assists (38 total points) and was fantastic in the Stanley Cup Playoffs.

Cirelli is not much of a game-changer offensively, but is one of the league’s best defensive forwards and probably has a Selke Trophy in his future. Add in the fact he is going to average around 20 goals and 50 points offensively and he is an ideal second-line center and still just turns 25 later this week.

Cernak’s deal might be the most surprising. He is a really strong defensive player, but the eight-year term (and salary) seems like a lot for the type of player he is. It is probably the riskiest deal of the three.

Tampa Bay still needs to clear out some salary this season, but the real fun is going to start next offseason when these three new deals kick in. With these contracts now on the books, Tampa Bay has already committed more than $78 million in salary cap space to only 13 players for the 2023-24 season. They need one of two things to happen (and probably both): Either a significant jump in the salary cap, or a pretty significant trade (or two) to get under the cap. They always figure out a way to do it (LTIR is always there!) but this is going to take some serious salary cap gymnastics.

Let’s review some of the most prominent free agent goalie signings, including Jack Campbell to the Oilers and Darcy Kuemper with the Capitals.

Oilers sign Jack Campbell: five years, $5M cap hit

The Oilers opened up considerable salary cap space by trading Zack Kassian and seeing Duncan Keith retire.

Personally, I would’ve preferred that the Oilers try to stay spry. Focus on bargains and values, while keeping yourself flexible in case your moves don’t work out. Instead, the Oilers are making some considerable bets on veteran players, especially from a term perspective.

Maybe these moves will work out, maybe not.

Late on Tuesday/early on Wednesday, the Oilers signed Evander Kane after all, handing a player with a long list of “controversies and legal issues” a four-year contract with a $5.125 million cap hit.

Like Kane, Jack Campbell is 30 years old. That’s part of the equation in assessing if the Oilers made the right call in handing Jack Campbell a five-year contract with a $5M cap hit.

On one hand, it’s promising that Campbell sports a .916 save percentage, and generated 17.7 Goals Saved Above Average throughout his career. He’s also a widely beloved teammate, something you uh couldn’t always say about Evander Kane.

For a 30-year-old goalie, his resume isn’t that large, though. Campbell’s only played 135 regular-season games in the NHL. Last season was his closest to being a borderline No. 1 goalie, as he appeared in 39 contests. Otherwise, he’s played 31 games or less (sometimes far less).

So, basically, there’s a mix of good and bad with Campbell, so we’ll see if the Oilers are glad they made a significant investment (again, especially in term).

Jack Campbell, signed 5x$5M by EDM, is an inconsistent starting goaltender who Is prone to fits of brilliance followed by, well, not that. Started 21-22 looking like a Vézina winner and ended it looking like an AHLer. Hot take, but I think his skill lies somewhere in between. pic.twitter.com/lBRuH8H5hn — JFresh (@JFreshHockey) July 13, 2022

Capitals end offseason goalie shuffling with Darcy Kuemper signing

If you were to spotlight an issue for the Capitals in 2021-22 (besides Father Time knocking on the door), it would be goaltending. Time will tell if the Capitals actually improved enough to justify their spending, but you can’t accuse them of sitting idly by.

After trading Vitek Vanecek and letting Ilya Samsonov (more on him soon) walk, the Capitals signed the big goalie free agent fish in Darcy Kuemper. The Capitals signed Darcy Kuemper to a five-year contract with a $5.25 million cap hit.

When it comes to judging Kuemper, it’s an especially interesting case.

It’s a misconception that Kuemper and Pavel Francouz failed to give the Avalanche quality goaltending all season long. Instead, Kuemper was fantastic during the regular season. His recent track record is very, very promising.

Over the last 5 seasons there have been 48 individual G seasons of 1500+ minutes/.920+ Sv%; Kuemper has 4 of those, more than anyone else (including Vas's 3). He's 4th in Sv% over that span, behind Shesterkin, Sorokin and Bishop (and he's played more than S&S combined). — Japers’ Rink (@JapersRink) July 13, 2022

Things just got rocky in the playoffs, especially after a scary eye injury.

Really, a detail like this would make me slightly concerned. What if Kuemper can’t track the puck at the level he once did?

During the Stanley Cup playoffs, Bednar says Darcy Kuemper had to go to optometrist 2-3 times a day to ""re-train his eye"". Other injuries: Val – broken foot

Burky – broken foot/thumb

Kadri – broken thump

Girard – broken sternum

Helm – abnomimal tear@Avalanche @AltitudeSR 92.5 — Vic Lombardi (@VicLombardi) June 29, 2022

Later on, the Capitals made another reasonably promising bet in Charlie Lindgren. Naturally, the NHL sample size is small, but it could pay off nicely since they signed him for a few years at a small clip:

Charlie Lindgren (3×1.1m with WSH) has done very well in his 28 (?) games over the past 7 (seven) seasons. pic.twitter.com/pJzMubw7k9 — Micah Blake McCurdy (@IneffectiveMath) July 13, 2022

Maple Leafs complete free agent goalie moves by adding Samsonov

After trading Petr Mrazek and letting Jack Campbell walk in free agency, the Maple Leafs enter 2022-23 with a goalie tandem of Matt Murray and Ilya Samsonov.

Following salary retention, Murray carries about a $4.688 million cap hit for the next two seasons. The Maple Leafs made an interesting short-term bet on Samsonov, 25, at $1.8M for 2022-23. From there, he could become a restricted free agents, and would have salary arbitration rights.

If you want, a subset of Maple Leafs fans will give you a full-bodied defense of the Matt Murray trade somewhere on social media. Personally, it still seems like a very, very dicey bet.

One of the (not especially convincing) arguments to getting Murray is that goaltending is unpredictable. It is, but wouldn’t that approach lead you to spending less in salary cap space, not well over $4.5M?

Instead, the Maple Leafs signing Samsonov adheres closer to that (defeatist and/or pragmatic?) logic. If Samsonov struggles again, it’s not a huge investment. If they find something, he’s young and cheap for at least one season. It’s a bet on potential and maybe lowered expectations.

Ilya Samsonov, in his 89 games so far, has been a little below average. pic.twitter.com/K8gdlXHEae — Micah Blake McCurdy (@IneffectiveMath) July 13, 2022

Other NHL free agent goalie moves

Let’s run down other free agent goalie moves of note:

Decent speculative goalie bet by the Sabres in Eric Comrie: two years, $1.8M cap hit.

How healthy is Jaroslav Halak at this point in his career? If the answer is “reasonably,” then this is a savvy move by the Rangers.

Veteran goalie Jaroslav Halak has signed one-year, $1.55M deal with the New York Rangers per @StapeAthletic. Halak is very good backup goalie. Great signing for the Rangers in our eyes. pic.twitter.com/8kcg8ccKnv — Andy & Rono (@ARHockeyStats) July 13, 2022

The Blues signing Thomas Greiss sure is a choice.

There were quite a few goalies signed who could be third netminders (Dustin Tokarski with the Penguins) or backups on very bad teams (Alex Stalock for the Blackhawks). Honestly, if Stalock is healthy enough to play, that would be pleasant in itself."

Kevin Harvick’s solid win Sunday at Michigan International Speedway scrambled the NASCAR Cup Series playoff standings and also created movement in the NBC Sports NASCAR Power Rankings.

Harvick earned a spot on the playoff grid by finally ending a punishing winless streak that had reached 65 races. His team now will be fully engaged for the playoffs, and few will be surprised if he makes a strong run at the championship.

Chase Elliott finished 11th Sunday, an odd race day outside the top 10 for the former series champion. But his overall worksheet keeps him in the top spot in the NBC Sports rankings.

The Cup Series rolls on to Richmond Raceway Sunday (3 p.m. ET, USA Network).

1. Chase Elliott: Last week: No. 1) — Two straight finishes outside the top 10? Is this a slump for a driver who had six straight races inside the top two? The Rankings don’t think so.

2. Kyle Larson (Last week: No. 4) — A pit-road speeding penalty cost Larson Sunday, but he bounced back to finish a solid seventh, marking his eighth straight top 10 at Michigan.

3. Joey Logano (Last week: No. 6) — Logano’s fourth-place run Sunday was his first top five in eight races.

4. Ryan Blaney (Last week: No. 7) — Blaney, who seems to do everything but win, was fifth at MIS. He now is the lone driver on the playoff grid without a victory and will be dancing dangerously over the final three regular-season races if he can’t pick up a win.

5. Christopher Bell (Last week: No. 2) — Bell’s strong run at Michigan soured with 40 laps to go when he and Ross Chastain crashed. Bell finished 26th.

6. Ross Chastain (Last week: No. 3) — Racing on fresher tires, he and Christopher Bell had contact with 40 laps remaining, damaging both cars. Chastain finished 24th.

7. Kevin Harvick (Last week: No. 8) — Remember him? Harvick had not won for 65 consecutive races, but he sparkled over the second half Sunday and won by 2.9 seconds over Bubba Wallace. Harvick suddenly changes from a pretender to a contender.

8. Tyler Reddick (Last week: No. 5) — Engine problems parked Reddick after 110 laps Sunday. His 29th-place finish dropped him three spots in the rankings.

THE TORONTO RAPTORSToronto can put together a serious trade offer based around Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby and multiple first-round picks.
What the Nets have wanted is reigning Rookie of the Year Scottie Barnes back in a Durant trade.","Kevin Durant still wants to be traded out of Brooklyn. Nets owner Joe Tsai backed his coach and GM over Durant-desired shake-up, continuing down a path of feeling he needs to take back control of his franchise culture.

In many ways, this leaves us exactly where we were before Tsai and Durant met in London: Durant’s trade request will be granted. Eventually. However, the market is not offering what the Nets see as a fair price for an MVP-level player (when healthy) under contract for four more years, especially considering where the Rudy Gobert trade set the market. Other teams see the asking price as too steep and have not gotten in a bidding war (and third teams aren’t jumping in to facilitate a deal). The Nets are being patient. With training camps not opening until Sept. 27, there is little pressure on either side to get a deal done today (or in the near future). There are questions about whether Durant will show up to training camp if not traded yet, but both sides are now clear about where this story arc is headed.

The big question now isn’t whether a team ups its offer or the Nets lower their demands to get a deal done (or, a little of both), but rather what team?

Boston, Miami, and Toronto are the three teams Shams Charania of The Athletic mentioned in the story that broke the Durant/Tsai meeting news. That’s not an accident. They are the three frontrunners, let’s break down their chances.

THE BOSTON CELTICS

If you connect the dots, this appears to be where Durant sees his best future now, even if Boston was not on his original two-team list of destinations (Miami and Phoenix). Every anonymously leaked story — as Charania’s story on the Durant/Tsai meeting was sourced — comes from someone talking to a reporter because they want to control the spin. I don’t know who Charania’s source (or sources) is, but reading it and looking at the phrasings, much of it clearly comes out of the Durant camp. This is where we start connecting the dots: 1) The phrasing “Boston’s package centering around All-Star forward Jaylen Brown is seen as a viable deal” suggests the Durant camp thinks offers are not getting much better than that; 2) A discussion of how well Durant gets along with Celtics coach Ime Udoka, going back to their Team USA days, was added at the end of the story.

Those aren’t just throw-away lines. That’s not how a well-sourced Charania writes, especially when he can’t just come out and say something directly. This sounds like the Durant camp recognizing the best offer on the table can land the star on a title contender in Boston.

The question is which Celtics offer is “viable.” The Nets reportedly offered Brown, Derrick White and a first-round pick. The Nets allegedly countered by asking for Brown, Marcus Smart and more picks — Brooklyn has said it wants to get every asset it can in this deal. There was some back-and-forth (we don’t know the Celtics’ final offer) but Smart proved to be more than the Celtics seemed willing to surrender.

Boston’s biggest question: Should they trade Brown for Durant at all? The Celtics are a top-tier contender already, an NBA Finalist last season who upgraded with the additions of Malcolm Brogdon and Danilo Gallinari. On the one hand, if Durant is healthy, he is an upgrade over Brown, providing an elite scorer and shot creator next to Jayson Tatum, plus KD plays solid defense. With him, Boston is the clear title favorite.

On the other hand, Brown is 25 and Durant is 34 — this trade shrinks the Celtics’ title window from five-to-seven years down to two-or-three, but if KD is healthy it opens the window wider for those years. If the Boston front office believes last season’s Finals run was not a fluke, should they get older or go with the guys they drafted and developed themselves?

THE MIAMI HEAT

It’s not a superstar trade scenario unless Miami is involved — Pat Riley is the ultimate big game hunter.

Miami came within a Jimmy Butler 3 of returning to the Finals last season after having the best record in the East — they are contenders, and with Durant title favorites. The problem in trading for Durant is the offer Miami can put together. Right now, that offer is, at its core, Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, another player or two, and up to three first-round picks (to get to three they would have to work out a deal with Oklahoma City to loosen conditions on a 2025 first-rounder, but that is doable). Sources have told NBC Sports for a while the Nets are lukewarm on that Herro-based package. The Heat have hunted for other first-round picks to sweeten their offer,

Bam Adebayo is the wildcard. He would be the best player Brooklyn could get back in a Durant trade, but two things stand in the way. First, Miami hasn’t included him in any trade talks (and may never do so — they see Adebayo at the core of their post-Butler teams). Second, due to the Designated Rookie rule in the CBA — stating a team can’t have two players that they traded for on max extensions of their rookie contracts at the same time — Ben Simmons and Adebayo can’t both be on the Nets. The same Simmons who hasn’t stepped on the court in a year and forced his way out of Philly. If the Heat became willing to put Adebayo in a trade (and they may never go there), they would either need to take Simmons back in the deal, or find a third team that would welcome him.

Adebayo being offered in a deal is highly unlikely, which brings us back to the Herro/Robinson trade package and the Nets shrugging.

THE TORONTO RAPTORS

Toronto can put together a serious trade offer based around Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby and multiple first-round picks. One can argue that Siakam is an upgrade over Brown (he has an All-NBA season averaging 22.8 points and 8.5 rebounds a game), but Siakam is also three years older. Still, that is a substantial offer.

What the Nets have wanted is reigning Rookie of the Year Scottie Barnes back in a Durant trade. Masai Ujiri and the Raptors have shot that down and kept him out of trade talks. So far. If that changes the Raptors can jump to the top of the Durant sweepstakes.

Toronto has been down this road before, trading fan favorite DeMar DeRozan to rent Kawhi Leonard — and it paid off with a banner. Would the Raptors try to catch lightning like that again? How long would Durant be happy in Toronto? The Raptors have a legitimate offer.

HONORABLE MENTIONS

Not included in the big three above was the other team on Durant’s initial wish list, the Phoenix Suns. Since they matched the offer sheet and kept Deandre Ayton (who now can’t be traded until Jan. 15), they took themselves out of the Durant running. Technically, Phoenix can offer Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, and a couple of other young players for KD, but that package is far below the others on the table. The Suns are out.

No, a Warriors reunion with Durant is not happening. It’s not even worth discussing.

New Orleans lurks in the shadows of the Durant trade talks, and if they included Brandon Ingram in an offer they could get serious consideration. So far, the Pelicans have not offered up Ingram. There are likely two reasons for that. First, they want to see how good they can be with Ingram, CJ McCollum, and a healthy Zion Williamson. This is a well-built roster without KD and the Pelicans would like to see just what they have. Second, and maybe the more significant concern in the Big Easy: Even if they traded for Durant, how long could they keep him? Is Durant going to be happy in New Orleans? Even with the argument of a good basketball fit, it feels like this would end poorly and quickly. The Pels recognize that."

Bloom said he had expected Sale to pitch again this season after recovering from the broken pinkie.","BOSTON — Red Sox left-hander Chris Sale broke his right wrist in a bike accident over the weekend and will miss the rest of the season, the team said, the latest setback during an injury-plagued three years for the Boston ace.

Sale had surgery and is expected to be ready for the start of spring training next year.

“You couldn’t make this up,” Red Sox Chief Baseball Officer Chaim Bloom said. “It stinks. It’s really unfortunate. We’re relieved this wasn’t worse, obviously. Very glad this wasn’t worse. But it’s been such a run of bad luck for him and obviously for us.”

Sale’s latest injury raises questions about his future with the team once he’s healthy. The 33-year-old appeared in just two games this season, throwing 5 2/3 innings. He suffered a broken left pinkie finger when he was hit by a line drive against the New York Yankees on July 17 and had surgery the next day. The start of his season was delayed after he broke a rib while working out on his own during the lockout.

“We need to dispatch some people to go find whoever has the Chris Sale voodoo doll and recover it,” Bloom said.

Bloom said Sale rode his bike home from a throwing session at Boston College near his home. He took his bike out again to get lunch and hit something as he was going down a hill, throwing him from the bike and causing what Bloom called “a pretty rough spill.”

Sale’s still-healing left pinkie wasn’t harmed in the crash, Bloom said.

Sale has thrown only 48 1/3 innings in the regular season and nine in the postseason since the end of 2019. He missed the pandemic-shortened 2020 season because of Tommy John surgery and went 5-1 with a 3.16 ERA in nine starts last year. He’s logged only 14 starts, including three in the playoffs, over the past three seasons.

He is in the third year of a five-year, $145 million deal.

The Red Sox came within two wins of the World Series in 2021 but are last in the AL East thanks in part to injuries that have diminished both their starting rotation and regular lineup. Boston entered Tuesday at 54-56, 4 1/2 games out of the final AL wild-card spot.

Bloom said he had expected Sale to pitch again this season after recovering from the broken pinkie.

He’s spoken with Sale over the past few days and said he remains encouraged despite “an incredibly bizarre run of events.”

Bloom said the team will develop a plan for Sale’s 2023 season in light of all the missed time.

“We’re obviously gonna have to do that and be smart with it,” Bloom said. “If we want to play 162-plus, we have to build our team to have a lot of starting pitching depth. That’s been a huge organizational focus the last few years. Obviously, it’s been tested this year.

“It just shows the importance of that pipeline and continuing to build that depth and we plan on going into next year with a lot of starting pitching options,” Bloom continued. “Knowing that whether it’s Chris or someone else, things do happen and we’re gonna need people to step up over the course of the season if we want to play in the postseason.”"

Durant requested a trade from the Nets a month ago, confirmed it over the weekend, and apparently will get his wish. Eventually.

Durant is reportedly unhappy with the direction of the Nets. However, Marks and Tsai made sure Durant had a voice and stake in the moves that were made, from signing DeAndre Jordan to a $40 million contract (and playing him over Jarrett Allen, then eventually trading Allen), to letting go of coach Kenny Atkinson and eventually replacing him with Nash, to trading a lot of picks and promising young players to land James Harden. Durant and his backers can try to claim plausible deniability, but Durant was in on the decision making with this team along with everyone else.

Tsai and Marks have moved in the direction of taking more control of the franchise culture all offseason, and this is the latest step in that direction. A lot of that also had to do with Kyrie Irving‘s frustrations about wanting a longer contract (something that plays into Durant’s frustrations), and the Nets’ frustrations with Irving’s contributions.

This means Durant will get traded, but the Nets will not suddenly conduct a fire sale. Talks are stalled out because the Nets are asking the world — an All-Star level player under 25, other quality players and multiple first-round picks — that other teams think is too high, plus third teams are not getting involved. Eventually a trade could happen — maybe to Miami, maybe to Boston, maybe Toronto or somewhere else — but with training camps not even opening until Sept. 27th, there is no rush to get a deal done now. The Nets will be patient, but today’s news hurt their leverage. The offers are not suddenly going to get better.

Which is to say, this still could drag out a while."

Rising cemented his spot atop the depth chart when he led the Utes to their first Pac-12 championship and first Rose Bowl berth a season ago. Now, he’s eager to show off all his skills.

“There’s no weakness in Cam Rising right now,” coach Kyle Whittingham. “He’s doing everything right coming off an outstanding year.”

One area where Rising has made strides is his arm strength. Rising did not test his surgically repaired shoulder with deep balls much last season. He had five 200-yard games and one 300-yard game as a passer. This season could be a much different story.

He has been fearless about taking shots down the field in camp and pushing his receivers to make plays on the outside.

“(My arm) feels like it’s back,” Rising said. “Last year, didn’t feel all the way getting comfortable throwing the deep ball. But this year, it definitely feels more comfortable getting the ball downfield and pushing it.”

Rising’s teammates are believers. His accuracy on deeper routes has left them impressed.

“He’s slinging it a little faster and a little harder,” tight end Dalton Kincaid said. “I can definitely tell the arm strength’s there and there’s a lot of confidence in it.”

Becoming a threat with the deep ball will simply add a new wrinkle to Rising’s skillset, which routinely flummoxes defenses.

He kept opposing teams off balance with his running ability last season, totaling 499 yards while averaging 6.7 yards per carry. Rising even chipped in on special teams as an emergency punter. He averaged 32.7 yards on three punts last season.

Still, Rising said he entered Utah’s fall camp with the same determination to prove himself that he’s shown since joining the program as a transfer from Texas.

“I still got to attack it and prove I’m the best guy for the job each and every day,” Rising said.

Rising won the confidence of his teammates and coaches long before he replaced Charlie Brewer halfway through a Week 3 loss to San Diego State last season. The junior quickly showed what inspired that confidence in the first place.

He threw for 2,493 yards and 20 touchdowns while tossing only five interceptions to help fuel Utah’s successful championship run. Rising completed 63.8% of his pass attempts.

Among Pac-12 quarterbacks, he ranked third in passing yards per game (214.1), third in passing efficiency (145.74), and second in passing yards per completion (12.76) in conference games. At season’s end, Rising earned All-Pac-12 first-team honors.

Whittingham attributes Rising’s emergence to his work ethic. The coach described him as one of the hardest workers on the team and said it has impacted every facet of his game.

“I just keep trying to improve,” Rising said."

13, the point at which Leipold is starting off this fall is a whole lot better than where he stood a year ago.
“There’s so many things that are different for the better,” Leipold said.
The 58-year-old Leipold is about substance more than style, though, and that could be exactly what the Jayhawks need to climb the Big 12 standings.
“It feels way different, just how we attack everything: the tempo, the pace, the excitement,” Jayhawks safety Kenny Logan said.","LAWRENCE, Kan. — Lance Leipold first walked into the head coach’s office at Kansas, arguably the worst program in Division I football, amid terrible circumstances and during a time of the year that only made everything worse.

The Jayhawks were coming off a winless 2020 season under Les Miles, who had then resigned in ignominy amid a flurry of sexual harassment allegations dating to his time at LSU. The scandal also led to the departure of athletic director Jeff Long, leaving the entire program in turmoil during a crucial recruiting period and all the way into spring practices.

Leipold never even conducted a practice with the Jayhawks until the start of fall camp last year.

So even though they proceeded to win just two games in his debut, extending their streak of losing seasons to unlucky No. 13, the point at which Leipold is starting off this fall is a whole lot better than where he stood a year ago.

“There’s so many things that are different for the better,” Leipold said. “We’ve said many times, player know the coaches, know what to expect. We still have a fair amount of new guys going through their first practice, and there’s uncertainty and wandering around – Where do I go next? – everyone is understanding and we’re in a much better spot.”

The long-time small-college coach pauses for a moment and thinks back to last season.

“Last year, two or three weeks into training camp we were still evaluating,” Leipold recalled. “We have an idea now. We still may be evaluating, but we’re developing at the same time. That’s a good feeling.”

The challenge now is turning development into success.

Six coaches have failed to produce a winning season since the Jayhawks went 8-5 under Mark Mangino in 2008, and none managed more than one conference win. That includes Charlie Weis, who arrived in Lawrence flashing Super Bowl rings, and Miles, who won a national championship with the Tigers.

The 58-year-old Leipold is about substance more than style, though, and that could be exactly what the Jayhawks need to climb the Big 12 standings. He cut his teeth at his alma mater, Wisconsin-Whitewater, going 109-6 and winning six national titles in eight seasons at the Division III school, then turned around a lowly Division I program at Buffalo.

Leipold accomplished all of that by being the antithesis of so many young, hotshot coaches across major college football whose success is largely tied to their ability to recruit five-star prospects. He is a football coach in the truest sense, rather than the CEO of a corporation, and hangs his battered cap on his ability to take good players and make them great.

He’d rather be on the practice field with his hand in the dirt than poring over spreadsheets in his office.

“There’s expectations, you know? There’s really no gray. There’s black and white,” said Kansas defensive end Sam Burt, who is on his third coach after starting his career with David Beaty. “You can see he knows what he’s doing. The whole coaching staff knows what it’s doing. And like I said, there’s no gray. It’s always like this or that, if that makes sense.”

It makes perfect sense if you know Leipold’s career arc.

He spent time at Doane, an NAIA school in Nebraska, and Nebraska-Omaha, whose football program no longer exists. And the two stints Leipold had at the Division I level were under two more consummate coaches: He was a graduate assistant to Wisconsin’s Barry Alvarez in the early 1990s and worked with Frank Solich at Nebraska in the early 2000s.

“Where we’re going, how we’re doing it – that was Year 1,” Leipold said. “Now I think this group has a determination about them in how they want to approach things and change the direction of this program.”

There was unmistakable progress last season, highlighted by a dramatic overtime win at Texas, and a full recruiting cycle coupled with a productive spring program have only carried that momentum forward.

“It feels way different, just how we attack everything: the tempo, the pace, the excitement,” Jayhawks safety Kenny Logan said. “We believe in what we’ve done this offseason. We don’t want to go through (another rebuild).”

Rather, the Jayhawks want to finish off this one.

That task continues Sept. 2, when they open their season against Tennessee Tech. Then comes back-to-back road games against Big 12 foe West Virginia and future conference rival Houston before another non-league game against Duke.

Those four games should help to tell whether Leipold is on the right track.

“We’re not in the moral victory business and we understand that completely,” Leipold said. “But we’re always looking at, whether it be individual improvement in certain things, how we’ve gone about our daily business and really how we’ve connected dots with our players about becoming better holistically, whether it be weight room or academically and better leadership, better teammates, that these things are going to stack upon themselves and help us on game day.”"

“Family, culture, I like the guys I am surrounded by,” Sanders said Saturday at the Cowboys’ preseason media day.
Last season, Sanders joined Weeden as the only quarterbacks in school history to receive all-conference, first-team recognition after leading the Cowboys to a No.
Sanders also is one of only two players in Oklahoma State history to record more than 6,000 passing yards and 1,500 rushing yards.
He’s been hit on, so he gets it and he’s OK.”His teammates say Sanders’ leadership and skill set are invaluable.","STILLWATER, Okla. — Spencer Sanders enters his fourth year as the starting quarterback at Oklahoma State, and he’s happy right where he is.

“Family, culture, I like the guys I am surrounded by,” Sanders said Saturday at the Cowboys’ preseason media day. “I’ve fell in love with every group that they’ve brought in since I’ve been here. I love my five guys up front. I love my running backs, all my receivers. I even love the other side of the ball. We’re all friends on this team.”

The redshirt junior from Denton, Texas, has made 32 starts for the Cowboys, 10 more than any of his teammates on the offense. His 24 wins as a starting quarterback are the third-most in the history of a program that’s produced NFL quarterbacks Brandon Weeden and Mason Rudolph. Last season, Sanders joined Weeden as the only quarterbacks in school history to receive all-conference, first-team recognition after leading the Cowboys to a No. 7 national ranking.

Sanders also is one of only two players in Oklahoma State history to record more than 6,000 passing yards and 1,500 rushing yards. His experience and success at football’s most important position is a huge reason Oklahoma State – coming off a 12-2 campaign that ended with a Fiesta Bowl win over Notre Dame – has high expectations for the 2022 season.

Fortunately for the Cowboys, Sanders doesn’t think the grass is greener elsewhere.

“It just kind of came together that first year I was here – I just felt welcome,” he said. “I am excited to be here. If I didn’t want to be here, I wouldn’t. This is where I want to be. This is where I should be.”

In 2019, Sanders set an Oklahoma State freshman record with 2,065 passing yards to go with 16 touchdowns, rushed for 628 yards and two scores, and was named the Big 12 Conference’s offensive freshman of the year despite missing the final two games due to injury. He missed two full games and significant portions of two others in 2020 but still finished with 2,007 yards and 14 touchdowns passing and 269 yards and two touchdowns rushing.

Last season, he was the anchor of a young offense that steadily improved, finishing with 2,839 yards and 20 touchdowns passing and 668 yards and 10 touchdowns rushing. His 3,507 yards of total offense and his per-game offensive average of 269.8 yards both led the Big 12.

Coach Mike Gundy, himself a starter at quarterback at OSU for four years in the 1980s, appreciates what he has in Sanders.

“There is no substitute for experience and reps,” Gundy said. “He is really good at what we do. He can run any play in our system. All of our really fast plays that we have – I think we have 47 of them – he can run them without being coached at this point, in my opinion. We have a really simple offense, except for the quarterback. The quarterback takes time. Once they get it, they all of a sudden get better.

“It’s much more difficult to play quarterback now than when I played, so that experience is really important. And he’s tough. He’s been beat up. He’s been hit on, so he gets it and he’s OK.”

His teammates say Sanders’ leadership and skill set are invaluable.

“Having a guy who’s experienced who knows how to push a team and knows how to win games like that boosts everybody around him,” freshman wide receiver Bryson Green said. “There is a comfort level having a guy back there who’s been in situations you’ve never been in before. He can guide you on the right path.”

Dominic Richardson, a sophomore who figures to be Oklahoma State’s primary running back, said the speedy Sanders has taught him a thing or two about running.

“He is very explosive,” Richardson said. “He’s a dual threat, for sure. He has it all and he’s not scared to get hit. He makes things happen.”

Sanders will still have a season of eligibility remaining after this season, should he choose to take it, so the potential is there to be a five-year starter.

He’s not thinking ahead.

“I feel like every year is a new year for me,” Sanders said. “I’m always excited to go out and practice with my teammates. I love being around those guys. I love getting better as a team and going out there and playing and competing as a team and winning together and losing together.

“I’m just happy to be around these guys. These guys bring the best out of me. Hopefully, we can get back in the game and get that championship.”"

If not, Georgia Tech could be looking for a new coach.","ATLANTA — Geoff Collins has toned down the hokey slogans that were part of his blueprint to build a proud, new brand at Georgia Tech.

He seems to realize there’s only one thing that really matters.

Winning.

After three seasons that each produced only three victories, Collins heads into Year 4 likely needing to show significant improvement to keep his job.

Only one other coach in Georgia Tech’s modern era has gone this deep into his tenure with a worse record than Collins’ 9-25 mark. That was Bill Curry, who was 8-24-1 at the three-year mark but at least saw signs of hope coming off a 6-5 campaign.

Not so for this Georgia Tech squad, which was outscored 100-0 by Notre Dame and eventual national champion Georgia in its final two games of 2021.

“We’re all tired of losing,” Collins said Saturday, less than 24 hours after the Yellow Jackets opened their preseason camp. “We want to play a really good brand of football. We want to make everybody proud who supports Georgia Tech.”

Everyone knew the road would be a bit bumpy after Collins took over in 2019, especially with the jarring transition from a run-oriented, option offense favored by his predecessor, Paul Johnson, to a pro-style attack.

Yet no one expected the Yellow Jacket to look like they’re starting over again this deep into the Collins era.

At the Atlantic Coast Conference’s preseason media event, Georgia Tech was picked to finish sixth in the Coastal Division, ahead of only Duke.

With a brutal schedule that includes three 10-win teams in the first five games – starting with Clemson on Labor Day at nearby Mercedes-Benz Stadium – it’s hard to envision a path that leads the Yellow Jackets to a better showing than last year’s 3-9 mark.

Collins is under as much heat as any coach in the country (well, perhaps excluding Auburn’s Bryan Harsin) and knows he’s got to show tangible proof that he’s got the program headed in the right direction.

That means actual wins, not just words.

His players know it, too.

“We know it hasn’t been the best couple of seasons,” senior receiver Malachi Carter said. “But if we dwell on that, this won’t be a good season, either.”

During a nearly half-hour session with the media at Georgia Tech’s indoor practice facility, Collins never mentioned the “404 culture,” his love of Waffle House or any of the other Atlanta-centric references he harped on during his first three years in hopes of giving his program a big-city appeal to potential recruits.

The incessant selling job prompted some critics to deride him as “Coach Slogan.”

Now, he’s got to show he can coach some football.

As is often the case for those under fire, Collins made some big changes to his coaching staff.

On the offensive side, he brought in Chip Long as coordinator and 2000 Heisman Trophy winner Chris Weinke to work with the quarterbacks.

Both were hired largely with the intent of getting more production out of quarterback Jeff Sims, who has a big arm and plenty of running ability but has been far too inconsistent over his first two seasons.

“Absolutely,” Collins conceded. “That was the focal point through the entire conversation, the entire (hiring) process.”

Long and Weinke will largely have Sims and the offense to themselves, giving Collins a chance to devote more time to the other side of the line.

The Yellow Jackets ranked near the bottom of the ACC in most defensive categories, giving up 455.3 yards and 33.5 points a game. In a sign of the struggles that ranged from the front line to the secondary, they had only 20 sacks (Virginia was the lone team with fewer) and ranked last in the ACC with a measly three interceptions.

Collins, who was known during his days as a defensive assistant for aggressive units that created plenty of havoc, must find a way to bring out that style with the Jackets.

“Obviously, a lot of decisions that were made (with the coaching staff) were made for me to be able to spend more time with the defense,” Collins said. “All the new, fresh ideas, and people I can lean on as well, have been very beneficial for the program.”

That all sounds good. Now, it must show up on the scoreboard.

If not, Georgia Tech could be looking for a new coach."

“There are certain things you can’t teach on the mountaintop,” Swinney said as the Tigers opened fall camp.

His team, Swinney believes, carries a new, healthier perspective after what it went through in 2021. A year ago, the Tigers were runaway favorites to win a seventh straight Atlantic Coast Conference crown and gain a seventh consecutive berth in the College Football Playoff.

Instead, Clemson opened 4-3, including losses to eventual national champion Georgia and ACC winner Pittsburgh.

The Tigers, in Swinney’s own words, were not very good, but he told them they’d be judged on how they got back up with most of the season left to play.

Clemson finished with six straight wins – the longest current streak among Power Five programs – and have carried more than momentum throughout this offseason.

“They’ve gained a reset on the appreciation of winning,” Swinney said. “Sometimes, you can win so much you can lose respect for what it takes.”

Any disrespect for the process came along with a rash of injuries, the likes of which the program hadn’t experienced in several years. Starting tailback Will Shipley missed three games with a foot injury while defensive tackle Bryan Bresee – like Shipley a five-star recruit – was lost for the final nine games after tearing an ACL in a loss at North Carolina State.

Both were held out of spring drills, but were back on the field and eager to provide a punch they couldn’t fully deliver last season.

Bresee was turned loose earlier this summer and was thrilled to once more work with his teammates.

“I think this offseason, we’ve been a lot closer as a team,” Bresee said. “That’s been a big deal for us.”

Shipley said having momentum from their finish last year has been a big lift for the Tigers.

“We’ve definitely got it in the back of our minds,” he said. “We’re ready to run out there Sept. 5” at Georgia Tech to open the season.

Starting quarterback DJ Uiagalelei went through growing pains, too. Considered a can’t-miss successor to national championship winner and top overall draft pick Trevor Lawrence, Uiagalelei struggled with his footwork and accuracy.

Uiagalelei completed less than 56% of his throws for 2,246 yards, nine touchdowns with 10 interceptions. He heard grumbling from fans who wanted him to transfer.

Instead of getting frustrated, Uiagalelei got to work on his body and habits. He cut out most junk food and reported this week 20 pounds lighter than his listed 250 pounds from a year ago.

“Shoot, he lost 20, 25 pounds,” Shipley said. “His dedication has never been in question. … I can’t wait to see him prosper.”

Uiagalelei has worked hard studying video and refining his technique in hopes of leading Clemson into championship contention, offensive coordinator Brandon Streeter said.

“Really proud of where (Uiagalelei) is, battling through some of the stuff he went through last year and just overcoming that,” said Streeter, also the quarterbacks coach. “That’s part of life, and he’s learning those lessons and he’s doing a great job right now.”

The slimmed-down Uiagalelei went through warm-up drills before leading the Clemson starters down the field in an up-tempo attack. His throws were sharp and on target.

Swinney said Uiagalelei will bring a healthier attitude to the field this season, too, just like his teammates.

Jurkovec completed 8 of 17 passes for 143 yards and a touchdown in the Boston College spring game.
“I just feel good about going into the season and feel I’m going to do a lot of big things,” Flowers said.
In both of those years, Boston College qualified for a bowl game but opted out.","BOSTON — To Zay Flowers, unfinished business means getting his degree from Boston College – and more.

“Win the division, go out the right way,” the BC receiver said after the Eagles opened training camp on a blistering day in Chestnut Hill. “I feel like we can be one of the best in the ACC.”

After leading the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2020 with nine touchdown catches and grabbing 56 passes for 892 yards, Flowers had a solid junior year last season with 44 receptions for 746 yards and five touchdowns. During the offseason, he toyed with the idea of transferring to a school where name, image and likeness funding might be more lucrative, but he opted to stay at BC.

Flowers, one of 14 children of a widowed father, said he would be the first in his family to get a college degree. His father supported Flowers’ decision to return to BC, even though the receiver potentially could have earned more in NIL proceeds at other schools — reportedly as much as $600,000.

A big reason for Flowers’ confidence is BC quarterback Phil Jurkovec, who is healthy again after playing in just six games last season with a broken bone in his throwing hand. Jurkovec completed 8 of 17 passes for 143 yards and a touchdown in the Boston College spring game.

“I just feel good about going into the season and feel I’m going to do a lot of big things,” Flowers said.

Flowers said he worked during the summer on running routes, making contested catches and keeping up his strength and speed. Jaelen Gill and Jaden Williams offer Jurkovec other options at wideout, and Notre Dame transfer George Takacs is expected to be a big target at tight end.

“In my opinion, Zay is the best receiver in the country,” said Gill, who missed the start of last season because of a stress fracture and finished with 24 catches for 269 yards. “I think we all have, you know, have our own unique play style. We all play bigger than we are. So I think we all complement each other real well.”

If Jurkovec can stay healthy – and he hasn’t been able to do that yet in his first two years in the Heights – Boston College could make a big jump after finishing 6-6 in each of coach Jeff Hafley‘s first two seasons. In both of those years, Boston College qualified for a bowl game but opted out.

The goal: Winning the Atlantic Division after finishing tied for last in 2021.

“The urgency has always been the same,” Hafley said. “Do I have a little bit more of an edge to me because I’m still a little bit pissed off on how it went (last year)? Yeah, I am. But the urgency is the same. Exactly the same. So maybe you’re just seeing a different edge out of me and maybe you’re seeing me just being more comfortable being a head coach and being who I am.”"

“I just wanted to make sure they knew what my intention was and what my focus was going to be,” Addison said.","LOS ANGELES — Jordan Addison said he didn’t know Southern California was the school for him until the moment he set foot on campus for his recruiting visit shortly after entering the transfer portal in May.

And the Biletnikoff Award-winning receiver said anybody who thinks his decision was about anything but football really doesn’t know him at all.

Addison realizes he left behind hurt feelings at Pitt, where he was the nation’s most prolific receiver last season while catching 100 passes for 1,593 yards and 17 TDs. Panthers coach Pat Narduzzi has strongly suggested star players like Addison have been swayed by huge name, image and likeness deals at higher-profile schools like USC.

Addison said there’s no truth to those insinuations, and they’re disappointing.

“It was definitely frustrating, but I wasn’t too concerned because the truth always comes to the light,” Addison said while wearing his new No. 3 cardinal jersey. “I know what my focus is and my intent, so all of that is just outside noise.”

Addison is fitting in well with the Trojans, who are completely rebuilding a proud program from its worst season in 30 years. He’ll also play with extra motivation after the rumblings from Pitt – and more overt insults from fans on social media.

“I definitely feel like I got drug through the mud a little bit with the media,” Addison said. “But I like being the underdog, and I’m always going to come out on top. I feel like it’ll be a great story at the end.”

USC has put together a remarkable roster under first-year coach Lincoln Riley while recruiting extensively through the transfer portal at the same time NIL deals are rapidly changing the sport. The conjunction has led to conflict, with veiled, anonymous accusations of tampering and unfair advantages leveled at the Trojans.

Riley, Addison and other players are increasingly annoyed with the aspersions cast on their character as training camp begins on campus.

“We’ve worked hard through our careers as coaches, my career as a coach, to do things with integrity,” Riley said last week at Pac-12 media day. “I think we’ve largely done that throughout my career. When someone challenges that with no facts and just only emotion, yeah, I mean, I think you take it personally. Absolutely you do.”

Addison’s move might have been the biggest transfer of the college football offseason if not for the move of his new quarterback, Caleb Williams, from Oklahoma to USC. Williams and Addison are both from the Washington, D.C., area, but Addison said they were no more than vague acquaintances until he chose the Trojans.

Williams’ talent has been obvious in USC’s offseason workouts, but Addison missed spring ball. He has participated in player-led practices this summer, and the Trojans are already impressed.

“He’s a freak of nature,” said running back Travis Dye, a transfer from Oregon. “That man can run like a gazelle. I’m excited to go out and watch him in pads.”

Addison said he hasn’t communicated with Narduzzi or former Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett since he left. Pickett is in the NFL, and last season’s offensive coordinator and receivers coach have also left Pitt – yet Addison’s decision to try another school was still framed as a betrayal by many fans.

Instead, Addison said he was attracted by the chance to play for Riley at a hopefully revitalized college powerhouse.

“Just me already knowing Lincoln’s history and what he did with some great receivers, that’s No. 1,” Addison said. “And just to see how the change was going here and the rebuilding process. I’m just glad to be out here.”

Addison even gets to wear his preferred No. 3 jersey after a conversation with Heisman Trophy winner Carson Palmer, who gave his blessing to unretire his former number.

Addison hasn’t been to the beach or many hot spots since arriving in LA, but he met at least one celebrity: He has worked out with Marqise Lee, the USC receiver who won the Biletnikoff in 2012 before playing for the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Since he’s likely only in town for one year, Addison has told his new teammates he’ll make the most of it.

“I just wanted to make sure they knew what my intention was and what my focus was going to be,” Addison said. “I wasn’t coming out here for all the lights, camera, action and all that. I just wanted to make sure they knew that I was strictly business.”"

But Kelly has tried to shore up the position with Oklahoma State senior transfer Jarrick Bernard-Converse and Ohio State graduate transfer Sevyn Banks, among others.
“We’re going to go through camp and have to make some tough decisions and, quite frankly, rely on evaluations in camp to do that,” Kelly said.
Still, Kelly sounded encouraged by a running back corps which saw the addition since spring of Penn State transfer Noah Cain.","BATON ROUGE, La. — Invigorated as LSU coach Brian Kelly appears to be by his first year at the helm of a traditional Southeastern Conference power, he didn’t downplay the relative uncertainty surrounding the Tigers as fall camp opened.

A coaching staff that has just one returning assistant – offensive line coach Brad Davis – has a slew of decisions to make about a roster comprised of numerous new players.

LSU opens its season against Florida State in New Orleans on Sept. 4. But as camp opened, Kelly said he could not yet even pencil in who likely starters would be at quarterback, cornerback or along most of the offensive line.

“A lot of good and bad things happen in those units, and there’s questions that have to be answered,” Kelly said. “Now, I stand here in front of you feeling pretty good about the players we’ve put together in very short order that can go out and play at a very high level in the SEC. But the fact of the matter remains, we’ve got to figure out who those guys are.”

At the end of last season, the Tigers were so thin at quarterback that they had to start receiver Jontre Kirklin, a former high school QB, in the their Texas Bowl loss to Kansas State.

Now they have four QBs to choose from, including two – 23-year-old graduate Mayles Brennan and redshirt freshman Garrett Nussmeier – who’ve already played under center for LSU. They’re competing with transfer Jayden Daniels, who was a three-year starter at Arizona State, and Walker Howard, a coveted freshman recruit.

None of last year’s starting cornerbacks have returned – not much of the secondary overall for that matter. But Kelly has tried to shore up the position with Oklahoma State senior transfer Jarrick Bernard-Converse and Ohio State graduate transfer Sevyn Banks, among others.

After losing three offensive linemen in the NFL draft, that unit needs to be remade. Among those returning from last season, Cameron Wire is the most experienced with four starts, but was plagued by injuries last season.

“We’re going to go through camp and have to make some tough decisions and, quite frankly, rely on evaluations in camp to do that,” Kelly said. “That’s a little bit different in my years. Generally, we’ve had guys kind of – you know, everyone says the depth chart, it’s always open – but you always have a guy penciled in somewhere. There’s not a lot of penciling in yet. So, yes, there’s some work to be done.”

This uncertainty, on the heels of last season’s 6-7 record in the final season under 2019 national champion coach Ed Orgeron, is a reason expectations for LSU are lower than usual.

The Tigers were picked to finish fifth in the seven-team SEC West Division in the league’s preseason media poll.

But if Kelly chooses the right starting QB, and the line blocks for him, the passing game could be elite. Kelly said Kayshon Boutte, who is wearing the No 7 jersey traditionally given to the most talented Louisiana native on the roster, is looking good as he returns from ankle surgery.

“He’s an explosive player,” Kelly said. “I’m excited for him, really, because you can see his potential is one of: Can he be the best receiver in the country? I think he can be.”

Jack Bech, one of LSU’s top receivers from the tight end spot last season, is back as a receiver this year. He is recovering from an injury, but Kelly was optimistic he’d be back at practice within days from shin splints.

The Tigers also expect to have a strong pass rush, thanks to Ali Gaye‘s return for his senior season, and the return of sophomore Maason Smith.

The running game should be bolstered by the return of John Emery Jr., who was ineligible last season. But the group won’t be as deep as expected; Kelly said Tre Bradford was no longer on the team or enrolled at LSU.

Still, Kelly sounded encouraged by a running back corps which saw the addition since spring of Penn State transfer Noah Cain.

“I really like the depth of the group when you add Cain to the mix as well,” Kelly said. “All of them have a chance to contribute. … I’m OK with that. I think that’s great. All of them are very competitive and all bring a little bit something different to the table.”"

Rattler believes he and the others can help the program build on a 7-6 mark in coach Shane Beamer‘s debut season.
He’s got this program going in the right direction,” said Rattler, who’s known Beamer since he was an assistant at Oklahoma.
Tailback Christian Beal-Smith joined South Carolina after gaining 1,254 yards and 11 touchdowns the past two seasons with Wake Forest.
“He’s been there to listen to the younger guys and he’s been ready to help,” said Hardesty, the former 1,000-yard rusher at Tennessee.","COLUMBIA, S.C. — Spencer Rattler smiled broadly and sat up his chair thinking about South Carolina’s first game a month away.

“I’m just ready to go,” the ex-Oklahoma quarterback said. “It’s been some time since I played football, like, for real.”

Rattler, who led the Sooners to a Big 12 title in 2020, is among several high-profile transfers who’ve joined the Gamecocks in the offseason. Rattler believes he and the others can help the program build on a 7-6 mark in coach Shane Beamer‘s debut season.

“He’s preaching everything that’s right. He’s got this program going in the right direction,” said Rattler, who’s known Beamer since he was an assistant at Oklahoma. “We’re focused on day-by-day getting better.”

Rattler and his teammates reported for meetings and planning sessions before hitting the field for the first time.

For Rattler, the change of scenery has brought a chance to show he’s the leader who threw for 3,031 yards and 28 touchdowns two years ago ago instead of a starter who was benched in favor of Caleb Williams midway through the season.

Tight end Austin Stogner, Rattler’s teammate at Oklahoma and now South Carolina, was on a December visit with Beamer researching his own transfer plans when he encouraged the quarterback to consider the Gamecocks.

“Now, we’re both here,” Stogner said.

And Stogner’s not the only addition. Tailback Christian Beal-Smith joined South Carolina after gaining 1,254 yards and 11 touchdowns the past two seasons with Wake Forest. Receiver Corey Rucker transferred from Arkansas State, where he caught 59 passes for 826 yards and nine touchdowns.

The group, which also includes Georgia runner Lovesea Carroll and North Carolina State defensive end Terrell Dawkins, had blended in nicely through spring and summer sessions, according to Beamer.

“We’re pretty far along,” Beamer said.

Part of that was the way Rattler and the others have kept their heads down to blend with their new teammates, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Marcus Satterfield said.

Rattler, a top-tier Heisman Trophy candidate for the Sooners this time a year ago, could’ve flaunted his celebrity or talked up his accomplishments at his new location.

“But he had the discipline to not rub anybody the wrong way,” Satterfield said.

Offensive lineman Dylan Wonnum seconds that. He sits next to Rattler in team meetings and has found a friendly player already invested in being a strong teammate. “He came in humble,” Wonnum said.

Beal-Smith, at 23 and a grad transfer, has also let his work habits do the talking, said running backs coach Montario Hardesty.

“He’s been there to listen to the younger guys and he’s been ready to help,” said Hardesty, the former 1,000-yard rusher at Tennessee.

Rattler has liked what he’s seen of South Carolina’s skill group. The bonding that started in spring workouts has continued into the summer and Rattler is confident he’ll connect with them through the season.

It took Rattler a little time to shake off going from Heisman hopeful for a College Football Playoff contender last August to someone who mopped up in Sooner blowouts the second half of last season.

“I don’t have to try and prove anything, just get ready to play with these guys,” he said. “That’s the focus.”

South Carolina’s offense used four starting quarterbacks, including former graduate assistant coach Zeb Noland, because of injuries and inconsistencies. The Gamecocks were next to last in the Southeastern Conference in scoring offense (22.6 points a game) and pass offense (201.2 yards a game).

Rattler believes he can bring some stability and perspective to the position after what he went through a year ago.

“I’ve learned a lot, being a quarterback, going through the (transfer) portal, going through adversity, it’s made me realize a lot of different things and see things differently,” he said. “Other than that, I’m the same guy ready to work and have fun.”"

A three-year starter at Auburn, Nix transferred to Oregon in the offseason and now finds himself in a competition at quarterback with young prospects Ty Thompson and Jay Butterfield.

Nix competed with LSU transfer T.J. Finley at Auburn during fall camp last year. He won the job, but was replaced by Finley in mid-November when be broke his ankle.

Nix said it’s been the same every fall camp since he was a freshman: He pours himself into securing the job.

“I wanted that really bad obviously,” he said. “It’s something that I’ve always wanted to do and so I put my life to it, and that’s just what I’ve been doing for the past couple of years, all this these competitions. I mean, you really do have to put your life to it and everything’s got to be about it.”

The former five-star recruit started the first 34 games of his career at Auburn before the season-ending ankle injury. Last season threw for 2,294 yards with 11 touchdowns and three interceptions. Known for his mobility, he also ran for four touchdowns. But the Tigers, under first-year head coach Bryan Harsin, struggled somewhat and finished 6-7 for their first season below .500 since 2012.

Nix joins a team that is going through its own transition: The Ducks are embarking on their first season under Dan Lanning, former defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at Georgia.

Nix said that even in SEC country Oregon is a well-known and respected team, which is why he settled on the Ducks.

“The brand of Oregon, the `O’ itself signifies so much in college football, year in and year out, they have a chance to be in the top four in the country,” he said. “That’s what I wanted to be a part of. I wanted to be able to play and have a chance to play in the playoff. And I know that with my skills I could contribute.”

The move also reunites him with new Oregon offensive coordinator Kenny Dillingham, who was Auburn’s offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach when Nix was a freshman. That year Nix won SEC Freshman of the Year honors.

Nix, the son of former Auburn quarterback Patrick Nix, is more comfortable in Eugene since getting married in the offseason. At 22, he’s among the oldest players on the team.

“Especially now being here, I feel like the oldest guy. Even though it’s not necessarily my age. People kind of look at me because I’m already married, I’ve been through a lot, they kind of assume that I’m just a lot older,” Nix said. “Which is a good thing, because we have a lot of younger guys that haven’t had same experience.”

Thompson, his main competition, played in three games last season as a true freshman while redshirting. He passed for 87 total yards with two touchdowns and one interception.

But players say Butterfield, who appeared in one game last season, is in the mix, too.

“We’re going to compete at quarterback like we do at every position,” Lanning said. “I’m really excited that we have quarterbacks that can play winning football at the University of Oregon,” Lanning said. “If I felt like it gave us a competitive advantage to tell you, I would. I don’t.”

While Nix is the presumed front-runner in the competition because of his experience, he also serves as a mentor to Thompson and Butterfield.

“Bo is a natural born leader. He’s like a coach on the field sometimes. He’s obviously older, he’s going into his fourth year in college and he’s been-there, done-that in the SEC,” Thompson said. “So he knows his way around the field and he just does a really good job vocalizing stuff like that. And he’s a really good athlete, we all know that.”"

Some clandestine shots of Bennett’s sweet fade generated plenty of buzz on social media – and seemingly signaled a team that is hungry for another title.
“That goes back to that lock in, lock out,” coach Kirby Smart said.

To the surprise of many, Bennett passed on the chance to close out his college career with a national championship.","ATHENS, Ga. — The Georgia Bulldogs aren’t resting on their laurels – or their locks – as they begin defense of college football’s national championship.

Quarterback Stetson Bennett and several of his teammates chopped off a significant chunk of hair before the start of preseason practice Thursday.

Some clandestine shots of Bennett’s sweet fade generated plenty of buzz on social media – and seemingly signaled a team that is hungry for another title.

“That goes back to that lock in, lock out,” coach Kirby Smart said. “Lock into camp, lock out all the noise and all the social media things and get really focused on being the best version of yourself. And there were several guys that, I guess, decided to do that through their hair.”

Georgia is coming off its first national championship since 1980, culminating with a decisive takedown of the dynasty everyone has been chasing for more than a decade, Southeastern Conference rival Alabama.

But if anyone expects the Bulldogs to back off the throttle, think again. Smart landed another haul of top recruits and keeps preaching that his players will be the hunters, not the hunted, in their pursuit of a repeat title.

“We don’t have a reason to be complacent,” said Smart, who was recently rewarded with a 10-year contract extension worth more than $110 million. “I’ve been on national championship teams that won it all that I was concerned about complacency because there were a lot of players back. We don’t really have that problem.”

Indeed, the Bulldogs have some huge holes to fill after a record 15 players were selected in the NFL draft, the most from one school since it became a seven-round event nearly three decades ago.

Five of those players went in the first round – all of them from Georgia’s fearsome defense. End Travon Walker was the top overall pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars, and teammates Jordan Davis, Quay Walker, Devonta Wyatt and Lewis Cine also had their names called in the first 32 selections.

The way Smart sees it, he’s got plenty of guys who are eager to make their mark after watching others hold down a starring role.

That is especially true along a defensive line that was anchored in the middle by the mammoth Davis, flanked by Wyatt and Travon Walker.

Jalen Carter returns to lead a new-look line that will have the seemingly impossible task of replacing three first-rounders.

Bring it on, said nose tackle Zion Logue, one of those who will be expected to carry a much bigger load. Even with all the losses, there is still plenty of talent on the defensive side.

“The way we recruit, man, and the way we work, guys actually want to come here and be great,” Logue said. “When you have guys that want to come here and actually do the right things, do the right steps to get back to where we want to get to, I think we can be successful.”

The Bulldogs open the season Sept. 3 at Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium with a most intriguing match-up against Oregon, now coached by former Georgia defensive coordinator Dan Lanning.

Smart passed on the chance to look ahead.

“”The last thing I’m worried about is Dan Lanning,” Smart said. “We’ve got a million battles to face before that. I’m not even thinking about Oregon. Our concern is our roster.”

The Georgia offense also has some big holes to fill, but experience is certainly not a concern at quarterback. To the surprise of many, Bennett passed on the chance to close out his college career with a national championship. He’s back for his sixth college season, eager to add to an already improbable journey from walk-on to title-winning QB.

“The leadership that he brings to the table, being here for a bunch of years, and the experience,” offensive tackle Warren McClendon said. “He’s taken a lot of reps. He’s seen a lot of stuff. He helps us get in the right stuff and where we need to be.”

The Bulldogs are counting on Bennett to play like a veteran.

The contract extension announced Wednesday means the first nine games since the return of the Big 12 title game in 2017 will be at 80,000-seat AT&T Stadium. The announcement came during Commissioner Brett Yormark‘s first official week on the job.

The Big 12 didn’t have a championship game from 2011-16 after realignment reduced the league to 10 teams. The conference brought the title game back despite its round-robin regular-season schedule, believing the extra game would help get the league champion into the College Football Playoff.

Zanders has had three surgeries to repair and rehab a torn labrum. He was cleared to compete at the Tigers’ fall camp. However, Zanders said on social media he felt he was not “physically able” to be the player he had been and made the choice to step away from the game.

Zanders started nine games for Clemson in 2020, then sustained a season-ending shoulder injury in the Tigers’ 10-3 loss to eventual national champion Georgia in last year’s opening game.

The 6-foot-1, 210-pound fourth-year junior from Shelby, North Carolina, has had three surgeries to try and fix the injury. He leaves the program with 57 tackles, three sacks and four pass breakups in 25 games, 10 of them as a starter.

While Zanders is disappointed, he said he leaves the game with no regrets. “Even as I enter my next chapter, I am proud that my journey and my life story include the opportunity to have played football at Clemson,” he wrote in his post.

The Jacksonville, Fla., native established himself as one of the Big 12’s premier pass catchers in 2020 and 2021, but his hopes of entering the NFL took a hit last December.

“I definitely explored it,” said Hutchinson, who has 147 career receptions for 1,758 yards and nine touchdowns. “There were just certain things I didn’t have in my control.”

Hutchinson underwent a surgical procedure after a piece of bone in his left thumb became detached, but he returned to play with a cast in the Cyclones’ 20-13 loss to Clemson in the Cheez-It Bowl.

His lone catch in that game was a diving, 34-yard grab – against Tigers’ cornerback Mario Goodrich, now a member of the Philadelphia Eagles – that brought Iowa State fans to their feet and set an example for Hutchinson’s younger teammates.

“I was actually kind of stunned a little bit,” Cyclone wideout Jaylin Noel said of Hutchinson’s catch, “but then again, it’s Xavier.”

This is not the first time Hutchinson’s dreams have been delayed or in doubt.

He enrolled at Blinn (Texas) College out of high school, but didn’t play in any of his first five games.

“I really didn’t think I was going to get any (scholarship) offers,” Hutchison said. “And I sure enough wasn’t going to get a Power Five school to look at me.

“But coach (Matt) Campbell said he saw something in me, just from practice.”

Campbell, entering his seventh season at Iowa State, took a chance of Hutchinson, who blossomed into a two-time, first-team, all-Big 12 selection.

This summer, he was named to the Biletnikoff Award watch list, given annually to the nation’s top receiver.

“X is a unique player,” Campbell said. “He can do a lot of different things. The best thing is, getting the football in his hands. He is a dynamic playmaker.”

Hutchinson will be the most reliable playmaker for a Cyclone offense that is replacing quarterback Brock Purdy, who passed for 12,170 yards and 81 touchdowns the previous four years – helping Iowa State post a 31-20 record and appear in four bowl games.

Hunter Dekkers is the new starter, having completed 20 of 36 passes for 193 yards and two touchdowns as a backup in 2021.

Hutchinson is already Dekkers’ favorite target.

“It’s the best feeling a quarterback could ask for,” Dekkers said. “He’s one of the best receivers in the country. He does everything really well.”

The Cyclones finished a disappointing 7-6 last season, after expectations for the program were elevated following a 9-3 record in 2020 and the school’s first-ever appearance in the Big 12 Championship game.

Hutchinson’s thumb is fully healed and he wants to help Iowa State make amends.

“I think Hunter is a good enough quarterback,” Hutchinson said. “I’m just there to make him look good, and him make me look good.”

Hutchinson’s former basketball-playing mother, Denise, and former track star father, Trent, both served in the Navy. The work ethic they instilled included regular 6 a.m. wakeup calls for Xavier.

“They knew what they wanted out of their son,” Hutchinson said.

Those expectations are being passed on to the rest of the Cyclones.

“He’s a guy who comes in and makes sure his leadership is felt,” Noel said of Hutchinson. “He makes sure the whole wide-receiver group is where they need to be and doing what they need to do.

“He as a teammate really elevates our whole team.”

Hutchinson, meanwhile, is embracing his role and his return to Iowa State.

“Most definitely it was a blessing in disguise,” he said of the injury. “I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.”"

They’re ready to rock.”NOTES: Running back Chez Mellusi said he should be ready to practice fully when the Badgers open workouts Wednesday.
Allen has honored former Wisconsin running backs coach Gary Brown by getting the initials “GB” tattooed on his left arm.","MADISON, Wis. – Wisconsin quarterback Graham Mertz‘s production thus far hasn’t lived up to the standards set by his lofty recruiting ranking and sparkling debut as a starter.

He’s ready to stabilize what has been an erratic career by helping the Badgers earn the Big Ten championship game appearance that has eluded them each of his first two seasons as a starter.

“My word’s been `consistency’ the whole year,” Mertz said Tuesday on the eve of Wisconsin’s first preseason practice as the Badgers prepare for their Sept. 3 opener with Illinois State.

Mertz was the nation’s No. 65 overall prospect in the 2019 class, according to composite rankings of recruiting sites compiled by 247Sports, when he signed with Wisconsin. That made him the Badgers’ first top-100 247Sports Composite signee who didn’t play on the offensive line since 2007, when they landed running back John Clay.

He left an early impression that only raised hopes he might lead Wisconsin to Big Ten titles. In his first college start, Mertz went 20 of 21 and threw five touchdown passes in a 45-7 blowout of Illinois. He set a school single-game record for completion percentage and matched the record for touchdown passes.

But, he’s been inconsistent since.

“We really want him to trust himself and go play,” Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst said. “Play with consistency and understanding that we have a lot of trust him and faith in him. With that, there’s responsibility.”

Mertz’s 2021 season exemplified his rollercoaster career thus far.

He threw a combined six interceptions and no touchdown passes in losses to Penn State and Notre Dame during Wisconsin’s 1-3 start. He bounced back and played relatively well when the emergence of running back Braelon Allen and Wisconsin’s top-ranked defense spurred the Badgers to a seven-game winning streak.

When Wisconsin couldn’t run effectively and needed Mertz to step up in the regular-season finale at Minnesota, he threw no touchdown passes as the Badgers fell 23-13 and lost their shot at a Big Ten championship game berth. He then regrouped to help Wisconsin beat Arizona State in the Las Vegas Bowl.

“That’s how you learn from the process and grow as a man,” Mertz said. “When adversity hits, how do I respond? When good things happen, how do I respond? You go through all of that and you learn a lot about yourself.”

One thing Mertz has learned is that his teammates still have plenty of faith in him.

Allen says Mertz accepted even more of a leadership role this offseason. Center Joe Tippmann, who rooms with Mertz, marvels over the quarterback’s work ethic.

“We’re definitely confident in him,” Tippmann said. “The way the guy works in the offseason, it’s unmatched. He’s constantly working his (butt) off. I know that’s going to pay dividends for the team and for him.”

Mertz is facing more obstacles as he heads into his third season as a starter.

Wisconsin must replace top two wideouts (Danny Davis and Kendric Pryor) and starting tight end Jake Ferguson from last season’s team, leaving Chimere Dike as the only returning player who had at least 100 yards receiving last season. Mertz is adjusting to new offensive coordinator Bobby Engram.

Mertz and his new coordinator wasted no time developing a mutual respect.

“He’s a great man,” Mertz said. “For me, it’s more than just football with him. It’s life lessons and stuff like that. It’s been amazing.”

Mertz believes he also will have no trouble helping some of these unproven receivers step forward. He considers that part of his responsibility.

“It just comes down to doing your job,” Mertz said. “For me, how can I do my job better, to free those guys up to go play free? We’ve got young guys, but they’re hungry. They’re ready to rock.”

Gabriel, a transfer from Central Florida who took part in spring practice, was busy showing his teammates around the state last month. He got his offensive playmakers together at a ranch in Lawton and took his offensive linemen to Lake Thunderbird, among other things.

The efforts were needed because the Sooners have a new coaching staff, and new coach Brent Venables said 40% of the roster has never taken a snap for the team. Some of the most experienced players have come via the transfer portal.

Gabriel simply saw a need and filled it.

“I have been around a lot of different quarterbacks and no quarterback has ever done that before,” Oklahoma running back Eric Gray said Thursday at the team’s media day. “No quarterback has ever tried to organize and get all the guys together … That’s definitely good camaraderie for the team.”

Gabriel’s goal was to create stability as the Sooners prepare for their opener on Sept. 3, at home against Texas-El Paso. That will be Oklahoma’s first game since coach Lincoln Riley left for Southern California and several players, including quarterbacks Caleb Williams and Spencer Rattler, later transferred.

“I think people here have gone through a whirlwind,” Gabriel said. “The school. The fans. I’ve gone through a whirlwind personally. But we kind of have that calm storm. Normality. Everyone is back to normal. New coaches. New team like every year. But now it’s just going to grind and now we’re finally here.”

Gabriel already was familiar with new Oklahoma offensive coordinator Jeff Lebby. Gabriel played for Lebby — then the Central Florida offensive coordinator – in 2019, and the Knights’ offense ranked second nationally in yards per game (540.5) and fifth in points per game (43.4).

Lebby said Gabriel has fit in nicely since transferring.

“I think the thing that he’s done is he’s been exactly who he is,” Lebby said. “He’s been very intentional on creating relationships and making sure everybody in the locker room knows who he is as a person. He’s done a great job of that.”

Defensive coordinator Ted Roof, who followed Venables from Clemson, said the next step – creating trust on the field – should be easier after Gabriel’s efforts.

“I think getting to know one another – that is so critical for any organization, but especially a football team,” Roof said. “Because when you get to know one another and watch each other specifically work, then you can respect a guy. You can fight for that man.”

Still, Roof expects there to be challenges the first year.

“Yeah, there is a newness,” he said. “Every day gets a little bit better. But certainly as you go through Year 1 of most staffs, but you know what, you’re always learning. If you’re not learning, you’re falling behind, whether it’s Year 36 or Year 2. So that part of it, we’re trying to learn every day.”"

“What you’ll see throughout the country now is a booster, OK, saying `Do I give my money to the athletic department or do I give it to the collective?”‘ he said.

“It has to be pretty equal throughout the country,” he said.","PITTSBURGH — Pittsburgh coach Pat Narduzzi thinks name, image and likeness rules were “probably” violated over the spring, not so subtly hinting those violations led to star wide receiver Jordan Addison‘s decision to transfer to USC.

Without naming the Trojans and Addison specifically, Narduzzi said he doesn’t think “there’s any question” his players were “tempted with (NIL inducements) one way or the other.”

Addison, who won the Biletnikoff Award last December given annually to the nation’s best receiver, entered the transfer portal just before the May 1 deadline and officially transferred to USC later in the month.

Narduzzi said he’d like to see some sort of guardrails on NIL rules and called the current set-up essentially a pathway for backroom deals that are difficult for schools to regulate.

“I want our kids to make as much money as they can, but I want them to work for it and do it the right way and not just black market it,” he said.

Narduzzi, who is entering his eighth season at Pitt and led the Panthers to their first ACC championship last fall, suggested the NCAA “remove the boosters from the game.”

When it was pointed out that the head coaching position at Pitt’s official title is “Chris Bickell ’97 Head Football Coach” after Bickell – a Panther alum – donated $20 million to the program for a series of capital improvements last fall, Narduzzi clarified he’d like to see the banning of the kind of third-party “collectives” that have popped up in the last few years as NIL rules have been relaxed.

“What you’ll see throughout the country now is a booster, OK, saying `Do I give my money to the athletic department or do I give it to the collective?”‘ he said. “I’m saying we should be giving our money to the athletic department and kind of eliminating that.”

Narduzzi added he would like to see some control over what boosters can do.

“It has to be pretty equal throughout the country,” he said. “(There) can’t be wide gaps or we are going to ruin college football.”

The Panthers open the season on Sept. 1 against West Virginia in the renewal of the “Backyard Brawl.” The series, which dates to 1895, hasn’t been played since 2011 after the longtime rivals left the Big East."

Coach Cristobal came in.
Then week by week you kind of just saw the additions that he was making.
Camp Cristobal starting this week is just another of many steps on the way back, he hopes, to the top.","CORAL GABLES, Fla. — It is now an annual question at Miami, the official precursor to the start of a new football season for a program that was once a perennial national championship contender and hasn’t been at that level for two decades and counting.

“Is The U back?”

New Hurricanes coach Mario Cristobal has an answer: “The U is back to work,” the Miami alumnus said.

That back-to-work process started the moment when the private plane that carried Cristobal home from Oregon last December landed in Miami, began picking up speed as he assembled a staff and got into spring ball and hits a new level when the first Hurricanes’ preseason camp under the Miami native starts this week.

There are a slew of acclimation activities happening over the next few days. Expectations from an impatient fan base are always high at Miami, are higher now because of Cristobal’s presence and probably rose even more when the Hurricanes were installed last week as the Atlantic Coast Conference’s Coastal Division preseason favorite.

“Oh, I think we’ll handle that by the way we approach practice,” Cristobal said. “There’s no one in this organization that should be feeling like they’ve arrived. If anyone feels that way, they’re quickly going to change their perspective by the way that we approach practice.”

Cristobal inherited a program that went 7-5 last season, a schedule that was cut a game short because coronavirus-related issues kept Miami from its planned Sun Bowl appearance against Washington State. Miami has one 10-win season in the last 18 years, with just one bowl win since 2006, and still hasn’t won an ACC title.

He’s the latest coach tasked with changing that. Armed with incredible job security – a 10-year deal worth around $80 million – Cristobal came back to the school where he was an offensive lineman and played for teams that won national championships in 1989 and 1991.

Those are just some of the rings he has scattered around his office. Rings from his days as head coach at Oregon and an assistant under Nick Saban at Alabama are on the table as well, a massive haul of jewelry that shows what he’s about.

“When things were changing, we were kind of all scrambling,” tight end Will Mallory said. “We didn’t know what was going to happen. Coach Cristobal came in. We were fortunate to get him. Then week by week you kind of just saw the additions that he was making. It just gets you that much more excited. I wouldn’t want to play for anyone else for my last year.”

Cristobal did not come home with the notion that getting Miami back into championship mode was going to take a few months. There’s an obvious push to win now – quarterback Tyler Van Dyke, widely presumed to be entering the 2023 NFL draft, could be one of the nation’s best this season. But Cristobal is also building for the long haul; recruiting has gone extremely well in terms of commitments, and the plans for who to pursue in future years are already underway.

His office has stacks of papers, files and notes, everything from past game plans at other schools to breakdowns of the current Miami roster to plans for the future – both for building a team and building more buildings, something that’s a top priority for the Hurricanes.

Camp Cristobal starting this week is just another of many steps on the way back, he hopes, to the top.

“When people see this, it’s like a grenade went off,” Cristobal said, looking around his office. “But I love preparation. I love planning. This is the stuff I can do all day.”"

There is no higher priority than to best position the Big 12 for its upcoming multimedia rights negotiations,” Yormark said.
The Big 12 added TCU and West Virginia in 2012, the same year Bob Bowlsby became commissioner.
“He’s going to be aggressive, he’s going to be bold.","ARLINGTON, Texas — New Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark is learning the NCAA’s issues in real time and during a period of sweeping change and uncertainty.

While Monday is Yormark’s first day working full-time out of the Big 12 office, leaving behind Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, the ex-CEO of the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets has been steadily involved in conference matters since landing his first job in college athletics.

He was named the Big 12’s new leader on June 29. A day later, conference realignment became a pressing issue again when Southern California and UCLA said they would be leaving the Pac-12 in 2024 to join the Big Ten.

Beyond that, Yormark has to get familiar with name, image and likeness compensation for athletes, the transfer portal, FBS conferences potentially splitting from the NCAA with their own governance structure for football, and the future of the College Football Playoff.

“One of his best qualities is he doesn’t pretend to know what he doesn’t know . He asks a lot of questions, and listens,” Baylor athletic director Mack Rhoades said of Yormark. “He hasn’t been in the industry, so he’s got to absorb all of that, which is, just under normal circumstances, difficult. But then throw on top of that conference realignment part two.”

When asked during his introduction at Big 12 football media days in mid-July if there were active talks with any Pac-12 schools, Yormark said his league was “open for business” and exploring all options for the future – but gave no specific details.

Pac-12 Commissioner George Kliavkoff expressed frustration Friday, saying he has spent the past month “trying to defend against grenades being lobbed in from every corner of the Big 12 trying to destabilize our remaining conference.” He also said his league intends to keep its current members and entertain new additions.

The Big 12 is going through another transition in membership, and its media rights deal with ESPN and Fox Sports expires after the 2024-25 academic year. While Oklahoma and Texas are set to leave for the Southeastern Conference no later than the 2025 season, four new schools will join the Big 12 next summer.

Yormark brings an outside perspective to what has been a resilient conference, as well as a background in building brands.

Before joining Roc Nation in 2019, where he was chief operating officer on the commercial side of the business, Yormark spent almost 15 years with the Nets, overseeing the club’s move from New Jersey and construction of the Barclays Center. He previously worked for NASCAR, where he oversaw a $750 million agreement with Nextel Communications for naming rights to the circuit’s top racing series.

Yormark said he pledged the Big 12 board of directors that he would ensure the league would be “bold and humble, aggressive and thoughtful, and innovative and creative” in growing its brand and business – and becoming a bit more contemporary.

“One thing is crystal clear. There is no higher priority than to best position the Big 12 for its upcoming multimedia rights negotiations,” Yormark said. “Everything we do must create momentum for these negotiations, as well as building the value of the Big 12 brand and business.”

When the Big 12’s only football national champions leave, the league will have only half of its original 12 members. Nebraska left for the Big Ten and Colorado went to the Pac-12 in 2011. Texas A&M and Missouri joined the SEC the following season.

The Big 12 added TCU and West Virginia in 2012, the same year Bob Bowlsby became commissioner. The 70-year-old decided earlier this year that he was ready to step out of that role.

Within weeks of the Sooners and Longhorns getting invitations from the SEC last summer, the Big 12 approved membership for football independent BYU and American Athletic Conference schools Cincinnati, Houston and Central Florida.

Yormark plans to visit all 14 campuses in the coming months, including the four schools that will join next summer, as well as departing Oklahoma and Texas.

“He’s the perfect guy for us right now,” TCU athletic director Jeremiah Donati said. “He’s going to be aggressive, he’s going to be bold. He’s not going to apologize for it. . We’ve got to just stand behind him and let him do his thing and continue to put us in the best possible positions as we can.”"

If there’s anything that’s been hard, it’s just really understanding that these guys have been through a lot,” DeBoer said.","LOS ANGELES – Coaching changes in the Pac-12 are a given, but it is rare when it happens to three of the most recognizable programs in the conference.

Such is the case with Southern California, Oregon, and Washington, which have new coaches on the sideline this season. The schools have won five of the last six conference titles.

“It’s interesting and unique. That’s what makes it fun,” Washington offensive lineman Jaxson Kirkland said during the conference’s media day on Friday. “Now we have a whole bunch of different teams and schemes coming around. It will be cool to see everyone getting after each other.”

USC made waves last December when it convinced Lincoln Riley to leave Oklahoma. After Mario Cristobal left Oregon for Miami, the Ducks tabbed Dan Lanning, the defensive coordinator at Georgia.

The most significant upheaval has been at Washington, where Kalen DeBoer is the Huskies’ third coach in four seasons. DeBoer was at Fresno State.

The coaching changes haven’t changed preseason expectations. The media picked Utah to defend its conference title, with Oregon second, USC third and Washington sixth.

Riley faces the most pressure to produce immediately after leading the Sooners to a 55-10 record in five seasons and two appearances in the College Football Playoff. Pressure is routine for Riley, who was 33 when he succeeded Bob Stoops at Oklahoma.

USC was picked by the media to win the Pac-12 South last year, but went 4-8 and fired Clay Helton two games into the season.

“If there’s no pressure, then you probably don’t have the same opportunities others do. You’ve got to see the opportunity. If you do it well, anything is possible,” Riley said. “This is one of those programs and one of those cities. If you do it well, the sky’s the limit.

“You don’t come to USC or Los Angeles to do things small.”

With a huge assist from the transfer portal, Riley was able to rebuild the Trojans for a conference title run this season. Quarterback Caleb Williams also came from Oklahoma, while running back Travis Dye transferred from Oregon and Biletnikoff Award-winning wide receiver Jordan Addison from Pittsburgh.

Williams said he hadn’t noticed much change since Riley moved to the West Coast.

“I think he might wear some flip-flops more often, but other than that, he hasn’t really changed much. He stays him, and that’s what you love about coach,” Williams said.

This is the first head coaching job for Lanning, who was on Georgia’s staff the last four seasons. He admitted that it has been a bit of a whirlwind getting up to speed.

“Certainly, a lot of pieces go into being a head coach. You wear a lot of hats,” he said. “It’s fun piecing together the talent. It’s also about bringing in coaches that are about relationships and development.”

The Ducks, who were 10-4 last season, open against defending national champion Georgia in Atlanta on Sept. 3. They return most of their front seven on defense, including linebacker Noah Sewell, while adding former Auburn quarterback Bo Nix.

“Certainly excited about going back and seeing some familiar faces going there, getting to compete against a mentor and a friend in Kirby Smart,” Lanning said. “I know our players are certainly excited to be on a national stage early and get to play an elite opponent in Georgia. That being said, we’re really focused on right now.”

Washington is DeBoer’s third head coaching job. He was at Sioux Falls for five seasons (2005-09) and won four NAIA national titles before coaching at Fresno State the last two seasons.

DeBoer is well aware of Washington’s upheaval since its last Pac-12 title in 2018 and is trying to make sure the transition to his staff tries to be as seamless as possible. The Huskies were 4-8 last season, but return some talent, along with potential competition at quarterback between Dylan Morris, Sam Huard, and Indiana transfer Michael Penix Jr.

“You got some guys that have had multiple position coaches. If there’s anything that’s been hard, it’s just really understanding that these guys have been through a lot,” DeBoer said. “Simplifying it down, just trying to focus on winning that day is what we are trying to do, worry about the things we can control and make a name for the 2022 team.”"

2022-23 year, eligibility: A sophomore, Estime has three seasons of eligibility remaining after appearing in 12 games last season, though largely on special teams.

Depth Chart: Injuries have moved Estime up the depth chart this offseason. If all backs were healthy, he would be No. 3 or perhaps even No. 4 on the depth chart, but with sophomore Logan Diggs (labrum) out for at least some of September and early-enrolled freshman Jadarian Price (Achilles) for the season, Estime will take the field at Ohio State as backing up only junior Chris Tyree.

Recruiting: Estime committed to Michigan State three months before the early signing period in December of 2020, and that decision seemed firm despite offers from Iowa State, Virginia Tech and Texas A&M. Then Notre Dame offered him a scholarship two days before the signing period commenced, and by the end of the week, the consensus four-star recruit and No. 6 running back in the country, per rivals.com, had changed his mind, joining the Irish.

CAREER TO DATE

Estime may have played in 12 games last season, but he took all of 18 offensive snaps. Seven of those included him rushing for a total of 60 yards.

2021: 12 games; seven rushes for 60 yards including six carries for 61 yards against Georgia Tech.

In the Blue-Gold Game to conclude spring practices, Estime took 13 carries for 59 yards.

NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS

QUOTES

The next time a quote is offered regarding Estime that does not reference his size or ability to break tackles will be the first time.

Only a week into being Notre Dame’s head coach, after viewing just a couple practices where he was also vaguely in charge of the offense, Marcus Freeman couldn’t help but acknowledge those aspects.

“Audric has done a good job,” Freeman said in mid-December. “He’s a big, physical running back. He was punishing a couple people yesterday.”

After the spring finale, running backs coach Deland McCullough also mentioned the obvious.

“Audric is impressive, his ability to break tackles, his attention to detail, the fundamentals and the technique that he operates with, the great attitude,” McCullough said. “Big guy like that, he didn’t really get to show it as much today, but this guy can run really good routes.”

Estime can display that route-running another time. It will be understandable if offensive coordinator Tommy Rees focuses on the bruising aspect of Estime’s game to start the season.

WHAT WAS PROJECTED A YEAR AGO

“It is worth considering Notre Dame’s fourth running back in recent seasons. Unlike most rushing stats, these are hardly skewed by the Irish enjoying such a mobile quarterback the last three seasons, because when the offense turned to a running back four lines down the depth chart, it was usually at a point or situation in the game when Ian Book was not putting his body on the line, anyway.

“Due to Jafar Armstrong’s struggle getting back to full health in 2020, Notre Dame did not really use a fourth running back last year, but in 2019, Jahmir Smith finished with 42 rush attempts and Flemister had 48, both nominally behind Tony Jones and Armstrong on the depth chart. In 2018, Avery Davis (still a running back in those days), had 22 carries in nine games.

“Estime will get some chances as a freshman, particularly since his style bears some resemblance to Smith’s and Flemister’s. What he does with them will be the bigger question, given he is unlikely to match his final high school stat line, averaging nearly 10 yards per carry.

“… Forecasting Estime’s debut campaign, 30 carries for 170-180 yards and two touchdowns would be a worthwhile baseline. …

“(Kyren) Williams will head to the NFL after this season, and given Tyree is positioned to take over as the lead back in 2022, (C’Bo) Flemister will be best served by transferring elsewhere for one final year, one in the primary role.

“Suddenly, Estime will have gone from fourth-string perk to 1B on the depth chart. That modest 2021 prognostication will grow two- or threefold by 2022.”

2022 OUTLOOK

If Estime proves both capable of picking up first downs and durable under the burden of double-digit carries each week, then Notre Dame’s 2022 prospects will rise. If Estime cannot handle that workload well, the Irish offense will simply not have enough skill position players to run a productive approach all season.

A Diggs full-go return by the end of September would mitigate the impact of a struggling Estime, but the dearth of depth at running back would likely catch up to Notre Dame in time.

Those may seem exaggerated standards for a sophomore with seven career carries to his name, but that is the drastic nature of the Irish running backs room at the moment. Tyree, Estime and incoming freshman Gi’Bran Payne are the only healthy ball carriers entering the preseason. Tyree and Estime need to handle the workload between the two of them to start the season, while also running some routes to spell Notre Dame’s few receivers. (One could not fault the Irish coaching staff if it put a red jersey on Tyree for the preseason to protect him from injury.)

In September alone, Estime should get at least 25 carries. If he is getting more than that, then it can be presumed he is picking up first downs and running over defenders as his physique suggests he should. At that point, Diggs’ need will be lessened, and he can be sure his shoulder is completely healthy before taking a handoff.

Too little has been seen of Estime on the field to offer a prediction for how his season will go, but only one look at the Irish depth chart makes it clear the impact he will have, one way or the other.

DOWN THE ROAD

The shelf life of running backs will force Tyree to consider the NFL after this season, but regardless of his choice, there should be an increased role for Estime in 2023.

If Tyree returns for his senior season, fewer carries will strengthen his future pro prospects, meaning Notre Dame will turn to Estime and/or Diggs to buttress the backfield.

Frankly, the Irish would always prefer to lean on three running backs and turn to a fourth for mop-up duty, underscoring the current concerns at the position.

However, it has yet to outline the exact rules that will determine what happens if multiple teams have the same record. Merton Hanks, the Pac-12’s senior associate commissioner overseeing football, said the forthcoming criteria will be exclusively based on conference results, a boon for teams like Utah and Oregon that play notable nonconference games.

“It was very important to our coaches, our administrators, our working unit that the conference decide who the best teams are, not other factors, so those will be reflected in the tiebreakers,” Hanks said.

RETAINING RIVALRIES?

While Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy went out of his way to bury the rivalry with Oklahoma, declaring at Big 12 media days that “Bedlam’s history” as soon as the Sooners and Texas depart for the SEC, Stanford coach David Shaw sounded a more hopeful note that the Cardinal’s long-standing series with Southern California and UCLA could continue.

“Selfishly being a Stanford alum, a lot of great games between Stanford and UCLA and USC. As I said earlier, my hope is we continue to play those two programs even if they are out-of-conference games,” Shaw said.

Stanford and USC have played 100 times, with the gridiron strife between the two private schools interrupted just once since 1923. The Cardinal and Bruins have played 93 times.

RISING TIDE

Utah QB Cam Rising spent all his time coming into the 2020 and 2021 seasons battling for the starting spot. After coming off the bench to propel the Utes to their first Pac-12 title and Rose Bowl appearance last season, Rising didn’t have to worry about locking anything down this year, though it never changed his mindset.

“No, I still feel like I have to go out there and improve myself each and every day,” Rising said. “It doesn’t really matter if it’s my job. It just means that I’ll probably be getting more one reps, and that’s just the way it is.”

Rising threw for 2,493 yards and 20 touchdowns against five interceptions in 13 games as a sophomore. He expects to be even better nearly two years removed from shoulder surgery following a season-ending injury at the beginning of the pandemic-shortened 2020 campaign.

“Getting my arm strength back so I can have the deep ball be more efficient and effective for us, and that was my main focus,” he said.

MISSING MAN

The Ducks are still reeling from the death of tight end Spencer Webb, who fell and struck his head on rock slides at a popular swimming lake near Eugene, Oregon, this month. Offensive lineman Alex Forsyth said the team hopes to use the memory of Webb, a popular teammate whose outgoing personality carried over to wider popularity on social media, to inspire them.

“Spencer’s enthusiasm in life and in football was unlike anything I’ve seen,” Forsyth said. “He was friends with everybody on the team. He didn’t care who you were, where you were from, what year you were, he was gonna reach out and learn your story and make sure you knew his. He was just a special kid and the best way we can do it is just finding a way to honor him during this season, dedicating everything we do for him. And we all got to strive to live like Spencer and live every day to the fullest.”"

The commissioner also acknowledged frustration with the upheaval created by the defections, saying he had spent the past month “trying to defend against grenades being lobbed in from every corner of the Big 12 trying to destabilize our conference.”

Kliavkoff responded to Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark‘s recent declaration that his league was “open for business” in expansion by suggesting that those moves could include Big 12 schools coming his way, instead of the opposite assumption.

“With respect to the Big 12 being open for business, I appreciate that,” Kliavkoff said. “We haven’t decided whether we’re going shopping there or not.”

The Pac-12 has lost its Los Angeles flagships after nearly a century of history, and Kliavkoff acknowledged the widespread speculation about the long-term health of his comparatively underfunded West Coast conference.

He needs some new faces to emerge to make it two in a row – and he thinks he has the bodies.

Just four months after losing Heisman Trophy runner-up Aidan Hutchinson, defensive back Daxton Hill and linebacker David Ojabo in the NFL draft, Harbaugh returned to Indianapolis to explain what the Wolverines have in reserve.

“We had a great defense last year,” Harbaugh said Tuesday at football media days. “People are asking how we’re going to replace those stars? The thing is I’ve been part of many teams where the no-star defense was the better defense and I’ve got a sneaky suspicion it could be even better this year, honestly.”

At least that’s the hope.

But much has changed around the Big Ten and especially in Ann Arbor since the Wolverines made their first College Football Playoff appearance.

In addition to losing Hutchinson, Hill and Ojabo, defensive coordinator Mike MacDonald rejoined the Baltimore Ravens. Then, for the second straight year, Harbaugh took the advice of his most trusted adviser, his brother and Ravens coach John Harbaugh, and hired Jesse Minter, another former Baltimore assistant.

The revamping and readapting, especially on defense, has become a league-wide routine.

Ohio State coach Ryan Day responded to his first non-title season by hiring defensive coordinator Jim Knowles from Oklahoma State. Injuries, turnovers and poor play sabotaged Indiana’s big expectations last season, so coach Tom Allen replaced both coordinators and decided to start calling defensive plays again.

“I didn’t like how it felt,” Allen said. “That’s where I cut my teeth as a coach and how I got this job. So we created a system where I’ll be calling the plays and Chad Wilt will be the defensive coordinator. To me, it was more of a gut-feeling that I needed to do this.”

The bigger changes may be more evident in the Big Ten West, where the league’s more traditional black-and-blue image remains most prevalent.

Iowa, Wisconsin and Northwestern have combined for eight consecutive division titles and have captured 10 of 11 since the league’s format was introduced in 2011.

Each team has had its greatest success when balanced, ball-control offenses are paired with stout defenses. The model worked perfectly for Iowa last season and Northwestern in 2018 and 2020 though the Buckeyes won all three title games.

The problem: When things go awry, it can get ugly fast.

“The quickest way to lose games is to throw the ball over your head at Level 3 and we had that happen too much last year,” Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said, explaining his team’s 3-9 mark with a lone Big Ten win in 2021. “It’s really everybody but we’ve been pretty solid in that group (secondary) over the years and I think we’ll be very competitive there this year.”

There is no guarantee Wisconsin, which lost eight of its top 10 tacklers from 2021, or Iowa, which lost three key players in the secondary, will be as strong in 2022.

Michigan State was an impressive 11-2 (7-2 Big Ten) in coach Mel Tucker‘s second season despite finishing 11th in the league in defensive pass efficiency.

But it’s Ohio State and Michigan that will face the most scrutiny this season after being picked to finish first and second in the East. The soaring expectations for Michigan after finally beating the Buckeyes for the first time in a decade only make the stakes that much more important for Harbaugh and his new defensive guru.

“I’d have to go back to before the 2021 season and my brother said you can have Mike Macdonald or Jesse Minter, they’re both great,” Harbaugh said. “So I went back and talked to Jesse Minter and just felt it was the absolute best thing for the team.”"

Alexander Rossi and Colton Herta both came back from one lap down to finish fourth and fifth for Andretti Autosport, while hometown driver Josef Newgarden was sixth.

Newgarden has had a rough stretch since crashing while leading at Iowa three races ago. He showed as the points leader before the crash, collapsed and hit his head after wrecking, and had to pass a battery of medical tests to be cleared to compete last weekend at Indianapolis.

In Nashville, he scaled back his obligations ahead of the race to be rested and able to race for the win. Although he was the leader late in the race, Newgarden had to pit for fuel and had later contact with Romain Grosjean, who was furious with Newgarden after the collision.

“Welcome to IndyCar. It gets tight. I don’t know what to tell him,” Newgarden said. “Let me tell you what, I about got taken out six times myself.”

Pato O’Ward was the biggest loser of the race, which in its second year was slowed 10 times for 36 of the 80 laps. The start was also delayed 90 minutes for rain and lightning in the area.

O’Ward came to Nashville fifth in the standings but dropped to seventh and likely out of the championship picture with a 24th-place finish. He was drilled from behind by Graham Rahal when O’Ward slowed on the track to avoid running into Power on Lap 26.

“I only have two paddles and an emergency switch. None of it works,” O’Ward said after he was hit. “Thank you, Graham Rahal. We can’t catch a freaking break. This is a joke.”

It was an equally difficult day for defending race winner Marcus Ericsson, who was only nine points behind Power at the start of the race. But like teammate Dixon, Ericsson had a poor qualifying effort and struggled to come through the field from 18th.

He finished 14th and dropped to third in the standings. The Indianapolis 500 winner trails Power by 12 points."
365,nbc,sport,A conversation about media rights created SuperMotocross,"['created', 'sport', 'series', 'media', 'months', 'conversation', 'rights', 'pro', 'supermotocross', 'racing', 'season', 'motocross', 'supercross']","What started as a discussion about how to create a unified media rights package for the two largest motorcycle racing sanctioning bodies bore offspring, and like most children, SuperMotocross World Championship series will have characteristics of both parent companies.
“It was the product of media rights,” Dave Prater, Vice President of Supercross told NBC Sports recently.
Then they noticed their current media rights packages were due to expire at almost the same time.
“This was the first time that our contracts were this close together,” Carrie Coombs-Russell, Chief Executive Officer of MX Sports Pro Racing told NBC.
The reigning Supercross titlist, Eli Tomac, currently leads the Pro Motocross points and is poised to add his name to the list in 2022.","What started as a discussion about how to create a unified media rights package for the two largest motorcycle racing sanctioning bodies bore offspring, and like most children, SuperMotocross World Championship series will have characteristics of both parent companies.

Last week, Monster Energy Supercross and Lucas Oil Pro Motocross announced the creation of a three-race playoff series that will be run at the conclusion of the motocross season. The purse for the new series will be $10 million.

But that wasn’t the goal when conversations first got underway.

“It was the product of media rights,” Dave Prater, Vice President of Supercross told NBC Sports recently. “When we took the media rights out together and started talking to different companies, that was one of the pieces of feedback we were getting – that the modern sports’ fan expects a post-season playoff as well as a World Series or Superbowl to cap off the season. We were hearing that from multiple organizations, so it seemed like the right way to go.”

One of the biggest obstacles faced by both Supercross and Motocross in approaching broadcast companies is the length of their respective series.

Currently Supercross begins in January and runs for about four and a half months.

With fewer rounds but more A Mains, Pro Motocross is shorter at three and a half months, but most of the same riders compete in both and have always essentially had an eight-month season. Tacking on three-race playoff brings that to brings the season to nine months and places the sport in the same arena as the NASCAR or the National Hockey League, two sports that dominate the calendar.

While this may have been in the back of the minds of executives in both organizations for some while, the timing was not always right.

Not much good came from the COVID-19 pandemic that paused sports for several months, but as Supercross and Motocross discussed the challenges in how and when to go back to racing, the relationship between the two took a slightly different form. Then they noticed their current media rights packages were due to expire at almost the same time.

“This was the first time that our contracts were this close together,” Carrie Coombs-Russell, Chief Executive Officer of MX Sports Pro Racing told NBC. “It provided a great opportunity to look at our respective series and realize that if we were able to go to the market together, we would have a much better opportunity to put a really good television package together.”

And the sum of the parts was greater than the whole.

As they began having these conversations, it became apparent that there was an even bigger play.

Eight months is a long time in a sport that is as prone to injury and body fatigue as motorcycle racing. It’s never been a matter of if a rider will get injured in his career, it is how often and how severe. Occasionally riders will skip one season or another to heal or rest so they can put their best foot forward in the other.

Over the course of the long history of the sport, both premier class titles have been claimed by the same rider 12 times.

The reigning Supercross titlist, Eli Tomac, currently leads the Pro Motocross points and is poised to add his name to the list in 2022.

Beginning in 2023, riders have an opportunity to win three titles in a season – in what will essentially be a third, hybrid sport.

Just as parents retain their uniqueness when a child is born, supercross and motocross look to protect their identities.

“The beauty of this is that it is two truly unique disciplines in the same sport,” Prater said. “You’ve got supercross and then you go to motocross.”

Supercross is about precision. The tight confines of an arena don’t allow for the long straights and elevation changes of motocross.

Motocross is prone to greater speeds in portions of the racetrack and it rewards boldness over precision.

The challenge will be in how to combine the best of both disciplines so that the winner of the three-race playoffs, that will culminate in a return to the LA Coliseum in October, 2023. completely represents the best of both worlds. Supercross raced there at the beginning in the early 1970s and as recently as 1998 when Angel Stadium in Anaheim was undergoing renovations.

Some iconic images came from that venue as bikes raced up through the grandstands through the peristyle and then came roaring back down into the stadium.

This type of action is what SuperMotocross hopes to revive. A little of both styles of racing, and a lot of uniqueness.

“The beauty of this is that it’s new so we’re inventing it as we go,” Prater said. “The challenge is that we’re confined (in supercross). We don’t have the space to do a true motocross-style track. The LA Coliseum is one of the larger venues. We can go up to the peristyle; that makes it perfect.

“We are looking at venues that can accommodate a large track like this, such as speedways, or just unique venues in general so we can accommodate this.”"

The hometown favorite finished sixth on the 11-turn, 2.1-mile street course after emerging on the more favorable side of a Turn 9 collision with Romain Grosjean on a Lap 76 restart.

Grosjean, who battled through the corner for position after Newgarden’s No. 2 Dallara-Chevrolet dove underneath, wound up in the wall with his No. 28 Dallara-Honda. The Andretti Autosport driver gestured angrily multiple times about the wreck, waving his arms at Newgarden’s car under caution.

COMEBACK HISTORY: Scott Dixon wins wild Music City Grand Prix

“Welcome to IndyCar; it gets tight,” Newgarden told NBC Sports’ Dillon Welch after watching the replay and deciding his move was fair. “He’s been on a worse end of that. I don’t know what to tell him. Good thing I was ahead. That’s the biggest thing. You’re going to want to be ahead of this guy at this type of moment, but yep, it’s tight street course racing.

“Let me tell you what: I about got taken out six times myself. I probably need to have some discussion with some of the younger guys, but they’re aggressive. They’re very aggressive and if you’re not aggressive back, then you get run over. That’s IndyCar racing. You’ve got to learn that pretty quick. I don’t like it, but that’s the game that we’re in.”

Last year’s inaugural Nashville race had produced nine caution flags, and drivers had predicted a smoother affair after IndyCar moved the restart zone to the Korean War Veterans Memorial Bridge entering Turn 9.

But the collision between Grosjean and Newgarden was one of several shunts throughout the Lap 80 race, which still produced eight cautions, a red flag and piles of damaged front wings and carbon fiber.

Grosjean also made contact with Marcus Ericsson, leading to a snippy postrace sequence on social media between the Formula One veterans. Ericsson, who finished 14th because of a mechanical failure, also retweeted a suggestion that Grosjean applied a double standard.

It’s not the first time the Frenchman has been in the middle of controversial contact this season after feuding with teammate Alexander Rossi at Mid-Ohio and with Graham Rahal (who suggested several IndyCar drivers were unhappy with Grosjean) after Barber Motorsports Park.

Later Sunday night on Twitter, Newgarden took on many Grosjean defenders and suggested the Andretti Autosport driver had been guilty of rougher driving.

He’s gotten away with much worse 🤷‍♂️ — Josef Newgarden (@josefnewgarden) August 8, 2022

Newgarden, who grew up and resides in Nashville, led 12 laps in trying to win with an off-sequence three-stop strategy, but the Team Penske driver remained in title contention. The two-time series champion is ranked fourth, 32 points behind teammate Will Power, with three races remaining.

“Ultimately we had a big fight back with the PPG car and Team Chevy,” said Newgarden, who has a series-high four wins. “That’s all I can say. This has been a really frustrating year in a lot of ways and the way it’s built. We’ve won a lot of races. We’ve had a ton of good luck. All thanks to the team and the effort they’ve put in, but more than not, we’re either winning the race, or things are completely going against us one way or another.

“So it’s built frustration for me because it’s hard to see that happen for this crew when they work so hard. I hate it, too. I’m very competitive, and it happens a couple of times a year where things don’t go your way. It’s part of the luck, but it’s just happened one too many times, and today was another unlucky day with just the way the whole thing played out, and you just can’t predict these races. It’s part of the game, but it can be frustrating at times.”"

NASHVILLE, Tennessee — The second annual IndyCar Music City Grand Prix is under way Sunday after an inclement weather delay of more than 90 minutes because of a lightning hold.

The race was scheduled to begin at 3:30 p.m. ET on NBC, but the track was placed under a lightning hold just after the Indy Lights race concluded at around 2 p.m. ET, and a lengthy thunderstorm soon followed.

By 3:30 p.m. ET, the rain mostly had dissipated, but the lightning hold remained. As of 4:20 p.m. ET, the lightning hold had been lifted, and the track seemed dry in most sections except a damp pit lane.

Drivers were in their cars by 5 p.m. ET, and engines started shortly afterward. The green flag flew at 5:13 p.m. ET as pole-sitter Scott McLaughlin led the field off the Korean War Veterans Memorial Bridge.

The race will be on NBC (until 6 p.m. ET) and CNBC (until the conclusion) when it resumes.

Track officials said all prerace ceremonies have been canceled except for the command to start engines once the track and teams are deemed ready for racing.

It was the second consecutive day that weather has delayed the Music City Grand Prix. Qualifying began 90 minutes late Saturday afternoon because of lightning.

Provided there is no threat of lightning and the volume of water on course is manageable, IndyCar races can be conducted with rain tires.

“Yeah, it was a huge win for me,” said Ericsson, who re-signed with Ganassi’s team a few weeks later.
“Our package on street courses has been probably our best as a team, so that’s why I’m really excited about this weekend.
Ericsson also is being advised by four-time IndyCar champion and Ganassi consultant Dario Franchitti on managing the title race.
We have a chance to do it, and I’m really, really, really eager to try and do that double.”","NASHVILLE, Tennessee – “The Sneaky Swede” isn’t that so much anymore, though the T-shirt heralding Marcus Ericsson as an NTT IndyCar Series star finally arrived at a racetrack this weekend.

Official event merchandise trailers at the Music City Grand Prix were carrying a red No. 8 emblazoned with “The Sneaky Swede,” a nod to the Chip Ganassi Racing driver’s penchant for excelling while lurking.

But Ericsson also noted in May that he sometimes felt a little too far out of the spotlight – a journalist from his Swedish hometown told Ericsson he’d been unable to locate any merchandise at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway featuring the driver.

That naturally began to change after Ericsson won the 106th Indy 500 and then led the championship standings for nearly two months.

But really his emergence began with the inaugural Music City Grand Prix, which Ericsson stunningly won despite extraordinary circumstances that required seven pit stops.

Though his first IndyCar victory had occurred two months earlier, Ericsson gained a new level of exposure at Nashville – where he went airborne on the fifth lap, served a stop and go penalty and then sublimely executed a perfect strategy to leap-frog from the rear to the lead over pole-sitter Colton Herta (who crashed with five laps left while futilely chasing the lead).

“Yeah, it was a huge win for me,” said Ericsson, who re-signed with Ganassi’s team a few weeks later. “It was the first Music City Grand Prix in downtown Nashville and a lot of eyes on this event. So to be the first winner and create history was really cool and really helped me establish myself at the top of IndyCar. It was a really big win for me, and I’m looking at trying to attack that victory Sunday.”

Having lost the points lead after the July 30 race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course, the No. 8 Dallara-Honda driver could use another momentum jolt, and he also will need to overcome adversity again Sunday in Nashville (3 p.m. ET, NBC) after qualifying 18th of 26 cars.

Ericsson has struggled to find the handle all weekend while lacking speed – which is unusual because he has viewed street courses as his biggest strength outside the Indy oval this season. He has been in the top 10 on every street circuit except Long Beach, where he was on track for a podium before a late crash.

“I’m still feeling like St. Pete and Long Beach, we were the fastest cars in both those races,” Ericsson said Thursday before his first lap on track. “St. Pete, we were running really well, and I got that pit lane penalty, which I still think was very harsh and put us at the back of the field and still managed to get a top 10. Long Beach, running P3 late in the race, and I did a mistake on a restart and stuffed it in the wall.

“Our package on street courses has been probably our best as a team, so that’s why I’m really excited about this weekend. I’m really confident we’ll be in the mix to win this thing Sunday.”

With four races remaining this season, Ericsson has fallen nine points behind 2014 series champion Will Power of Team Penske.

“He’s just a great driver, great competitor and been around a very long time,” Ericsson said. “He’s had an incredible season with his consistency and way of always getting back into races. Pretty crazy how many times it looks like he’s having a bad day, and he ends up in the top four somehow. He’s going to be tough to beat.”

But Power is expecting the same from Ericsson, whom he called “probably the best racer in the series” during the Iowa Speedway race weekend.

Nashville could be a major opportunity either way. Power will be starting eighth after a penalty kept him from advancing to the final round in qualifying, and even though Ericsson is starting 10 spots behind, he proved last year that anything is possible on the 11-turn, 2.1-mile layout.

Ericsson also is being advised by four-time IndyCar champion and Ganassi consultant Dario Franchitti on managing the title race. Ericsson has managed to stanch his points loss the past three races – at Iowa Speedway, he “took the fight” to the Penske duo of Power and Race 1 winner Josef Newgarden before his car faded to eighth after starting 12th. He finished sixth after qualifying 15th in Race 2, and he rebounded again last week at Indy by gaining 14 spots in a drive from last to 11th.

“We have to have that risk vs. reward calculation,” Ericsson said. “It’s a dangerous thing. You think too much of points and then not taking risks because then you’re going to put yourself in difficult situations. (At Indy last week), fighting from back of field and going wheel to wheel with guys for P15, it could be their highlight of the season. Then it’s hard for me to do the same risks because I need to not have a DNF.

“Things like that to keep in mind, but it’s a fine line there. The way to go is maximize every weekend. If we can win, we need to win. P5, be there. Then we’ll be in good shape to win this thing.”

Franchitti also is the most recent to win the Indy 500 and IndyCar series championship in the same season (2010) – history that isn’t lost on Ericsson, 31.

“Coming to America from European racing and Formula One, the championship was the biggest thing, but the more I’m here, the more I understand the 500 is the one you want to win,” he said. “What’s driving me now is to do the double. That’s not something that’s happened a lot in the history of IndyCar. It is hard to win both in same year.

“After the 500, there’s been great motivation for me to work extremely hard to win championship and the double. We have a chance to do it, and I’m really, really, really eager to try and do that double.”"

After serving a stop and go penalty, Ericsson switched into a sublime fuel conversation strategy that got him ahead of pole-sitter Colton Herta and into the lead for the final 25 laps.

NEW FOR NASHVILLE YEAR 2: Detailing the course changes and the reasons for them

“Personally I kind of like the way it was last year, just because how it ended,” Ericsson said. “But it makes the racing a little bit better. More flow-y. That could be good because there were a couple of places on track it gets quite tight and a bit too twisty maybe.

“I thought the challenge that the track presented last year was really cool. When we spoke to drivers, everyone was enjoying the track last year, it’s just for some reasons, there was a lot of accidents happening. The restart zone was one of the issues.”

Ericsson ran into Sebastien Bourdais, who had braked coming to the green on the first restart because of a mostly blind final corner after a short straightaway on the 11-turn course.

IndyCar has addressed the spate of accidents by moving the restart zone from the start-finish line to the long straightaway Korean War Veterans Memorial Bridge entering Turn 9 (where the race started last year. The apex of Turn 11 has been widened by 4 feet to provide more visibility in the 2.1-mile track’s tightest corner (which is located in front of the Titans’ Nissan Stadium).

IndyCar also has narrowed Turn 9 by 25 feet (from an 85- to 60-foot width), which should provided a larger braking zone in the slower corner, and smoothed out transitions on and off the bridge, as well as a major bump in Turn 5.

The changes have decreased the length of the street course by 0.07 miles (and shortened the 80-lap race by 5.6 miles) and hopefully also will reduced the number of accidents and lengthy delays and stoppages. Last year’s race was marred by two red flags and 33 laps run under yellow in a season-high nine caution flags — five more than any other road or street course in 2021.

“I think the restart zone was the big one that needed to change, so that’s a great easy change,” said Arrow McLaren SP driver Felix Rosenqvist, who finished eighth as one of only 12 of 27 drivers who avoided being involved in any yellows in Nashville’s debut. “I drove that track on a simulator with other changes, and honestly it’s nothing really major. I thought Turn 9 just seems a bit tighter.

“It doesn’t really change much. It’s just a slower corner maybe that will promote more overtaking because it was kind of quick last year, so you needed a lot of confidence to send it in there to pass someone. So potentially better racing, and yeah, hopefully avoiding the red flag deal this year.”

Herta, who 39 of 80 laps last year with a dominant No. 26 Dallara-Honda before crashing in Turn 9 with five laps remaining while chasing Ericsson, said being at the front could be a bigger disadvantage with the new restart zone.

“It’s going to be tough if you’re the leader to get a good jump,” Herta said. “It’s a really long straight coming out of a really slow corner. I think it’s better, yeah, because we don’t want super long safety cars and just the mess of what Turn 11 was last year on the restarts.

“I think it is a good decision. It’s going to be tough as the leader, but it is a really long straight (and) now with the tighter Turn 9, probably a pretty good braking zone. It’ll be interesting, though. It’ll for sure promote some passing, and maybe guys will check it up the inside of Turn 8 before the restart and whatnot. It’ll for sure be interesting.”

On starts and restarts, the NTT IndyCar Series tries to give the benefit of leading the field to the green flag. On the initial start, the pole-sitter is in radio communication with race director Kyle Novak about the exact point of acceleration, and on restarts, the leader is given discretion on where to hit the throttle during a specified zone.

At Nashville, it’s expected the leader will go full speed near the apex of the 1,650-foot long bridge (which is suspended 80 feet above the Cumberland River) – after the majority of the 26-car field as exited the preceding Turn 8.

Ericsson believes the long straightaway also will provide an edge to trailing cars

“I definitely think so because it’s such a long straight as well,” he said. “When you do that restart, there’s going to be a lot of drafting and slipstream going on, and Turn 9 is quite an open entry. So it’s a good spot to overtake. For the leader, it’s not ideal. The other spot was easier to get a jump and get going and defend position.

I. Can’t. Believe. It. We just won the @MusicCityGP 🏆. What an amazing team effort by the #8 crew and everyone at @CGRTeams . So thankful. Still don’t understand how it happened. But so unbelievably happy 🤩 #ME8 #INDYCAR pic.twitter.com/1A4IydJrh7 — Marcus Ericsson (@Ericsson_Marcus) August 9, 2021

“It was actually quite easy last year when you were leading because you couldn’t really get attacked where the restart zone is. Whereas now, it’s definitely going to be hard for the leader to defend. You need to really hit that restart well if you’re going to defend your lead into Turn 9 on a restart.”

Even if the race goes more smoothly in its second year, there still could be more track changes ahead depending on the further development of Nashville’s incessantly exploding skyline that is full of high-rise cranes.

“I think there’s other changes we can make to the course in the future once some developments happen downtown,” Nashville native Josef Newgarden said. “I know the promoters are really keyed in on that: How can we continue to evolve this track?

“But I think we’ll have a much better surface this year. It’s always hard. You come into a track the first time, you’re really not going to get a good test run until you run the race weekend. You leave the race weekend, you go, ‘OK, now we know how to do that better?’ I think they’re ready for this year. (The restart zone will be) much better.”"

IndyCar Nashville start times: A few new course wrinkles will await a new points leader as the NTT IndyCar Series arrives for the second annual Music City Grand Prix.

After a highly successful but caution-plagued inaugural event, IndyCar officials and race organizers have made some layout tweaks to avoid some of last year’s traffic jams and bottlenecks on the 11-turn, 2.1-mile street course.

The restart zone has been moved from the finish line in front of Nissan Stadium to the exit of the Korean War Veterans Memorial Bridge heading into Turn 9, which is the best corner for passing on the circuit.

RACE DAY UPDATE: Start of race delayed by lightning

Turn 9 also has been narrowed by 25 feet for one of several new suites that have been added on a street circuit expected to draw more than 100,000 fans to downtown Nashville this weekend.

Marcus Ericsson went airborne on Lap 5 en route to winning in Nashville last year after pole-sitter Colton Herta got off sequence with the dominant car and crashed while in pursuit.

Ericsson could use another momentum boost with four races remaining in the 2022 season, having fallen nine points behind Will Power (whose third at the Indianpaolis Motor Speedway road course marked his fourth podium in five races).

Nashville native Josef Newgarden also is firmly in the title hunt entering his home track after rebounding for fifth at Indy from his stunning crash at Iowa Speedway (and subsequent hospitalization for a postrace fall).

McLaughlin won the pole on a flying final run around the 11-turn, 2.1-mile course in Saturday’s session, which started 90 minutes late because of weather delays, and a sloppy, shortened first qualifying group left some drivers steaming with anger in the hot, humid Nashville post-rain conditions.

The Team Penske driver was also fastest in Saturday morning practice. The New Zealand native opened the season by winning from the pole in St. Petersburg, Florida, for his first career victory.

TIRE DESIGNATIONS: Starting lineup with initial choices on compound

“This car was phenomenal,” McLaughlin told NBC Sports’ Kevin Lee of the No. 3 Dallara-Chevrolet. “One of those good laps. Hopefully, more of the same (Sunday). Heads down, bums up and focus on what we need to do.”

Grosjean qualified second for Andretti Autosport, which had three drivers eliminated in the first round of qualifying. Lundgaard was a career-best third for Rahal Letterman Lanigan, which advanced all three of its drivers to the top 12.

Alex Palou, Pato O’Ward and Josef Newgarden rounded out the Fast Six drivers who made the final round of qualifying.

The top five starting spots were represented by five teams: Team Penske, Andretti Autosport, Rahal Letterman Lanigan, Chip Ganassi Racing and Arrow McLaren SP.

Lundgaard overcame a penalty in the second round and locked a tire in the final round and still managed to qualify third.

The championship contenders had a mixed day with reigning champion Palou, who is ranked sixth in the six-driver fight, the highest qualifier (fourth). O’Ward, who is fifth in the standings, advanced only because IndyCar points leader Will Power was knocked from the Fast Six for impeding O’Ward’s lap when he went off course in the top 12.

The penalty stripped Power of his fastest lap and O’Ward took his spot. Power holds a nine-point lead over defending race winner Marcus Ericsson, and only 52 points separate Power from Palou with Sunday’s race the first of the final four this season.

“We can have a great day tomorrow,” Power said of starting eighth. “Get good strategy, good pit stops and see what we’ve got.”

Josef Newgarden of Penske, who is third in the standings, qualified sixth.

Ericsson and Scott Dixon, fourth in the standings, failed to advance out of the first round. Dixon will start 14th and Ericsson 18th, where he started from in last year’s victory.

“We need to come up with a good strategy and play the race as it comes,” Ericsson told NBC Sports’ Dillon Welch. “It’s been a lot of incidents this weekend again like last year. I think there’s still going to be opportunities. We’ve been struggling all weekend. I haven’t got the feeling in the car that I want. The team did a good job in qualifying to get it more to my liking and felt a step in the right direction.

“We’re just lacking too much speed to the fastest guys. It’s a bit strange. I will say in (the second practice), the car was very consistent to drive. A bit of work tonight, but I’m hoping for a better day tomorrow. I think if there’s anyone in this pit lane that can fight from the back to the front, we’re always strong doing that. We have that confidence.”

Colton Herta crashed in the first group of the first round to bring out a session-ending red flag that ruined multiple drivers’ runs, including teammate Alexander Rossi.

“Little bit too ambitious for what the conditions were. After it rained a lot of that grip kind of fell away, just trying to find the right braking point, and I just overdid it,” Herta told NBC Sports’ Dave Burns. “I apologize to my team, especially to Andretti, because I think I probably screwed over Rossi there pretty good, too. And probably a few other guys.

“I don’t try to do that on purpose, and was really an honest mistake, so I feel bad for everybody involved.”

Here’s another look at what happened to Colton Herta. Herta says it “was a little too ambitious. I just overdid it.” #INDYCAR pic.twitter.com/rb5pEaSCUN — INDYCAR on NBC (@IndyCaronNBC) August 6, 2022

Drivers were seething after the first group because it was so short. Prior to Herta’s spin, Andretti Autosport rookie Devlin DeFrancesco also spun to bring out a yellow that chewed up three of the 10 scheduled minutes in the qualifying group.

It meant most of the drivers eliminated in the round barely had a chance to make a qualifying run.

“Man, I’m so frustrated. That is not the sport, man,” said Simon Pagenaud, who will start 13th. “We can wait all the day for storm to pass, but they don’t give us enough time to put our lap down. It’s just unbelievable. I’m speechless.

“It’s such a shame because you just don’t get to perform at your level. We’re going to start again where we don’t belong. A lot of guys don’t belong up there up front.”

Felix Rosenqvist, who crashed in practice earlier Saturday, felt his lap would have advanced him before it was halted by the Herta crash.

“Just annoying,” Rosenqvist said. “I didn’t even have a lap. We had a kind of warmup lap. That’s something we have to look at, maybe we should have gone straight out and tried to do a lap, but it’s annoying when it’s always red flags and can’t even get the session going.”

The abbreviated session meant that Dalton Kellett advanced out of the first group for the first time in 37 career IndyCar starts. He’ll start a career-high 12th and was embraced by team and family members when he finished the top-12 session.

Bouncing between interviews with national and local media, cuddling puppies and deftly flicking a paddle for the better part of two hours, Newgarden (who lives full time in Nashville with his wife, Ashley, and newborn son, Kota) was the host with the most in his hometown.

The fourth annual Celebrity Ping Pong Challenge (held for the second consecutive year in Nashville) raised more than $65,000 for charities Serious Fun Children’s Network and Wags and Walks (hence the puppies) and drew more than a dozen IndyCar drivers to Pins Mechanical in downtown Nashville.

It seemed the opening salvo to a weekend welcoming party for the return of NTT IndyCar Series to his Tennessee stomping grounds.

But it actually was Newgarden dropping the curtain on his appearance schedule for the weekend.

What a night. Thank you so much to everyone who came out and joined us for our 4th annual ping-pong tournament. Thanks to our generous sponsors and ticket buyers we raised over $65,000 for @SeriousFunCamps & @WagsandWalks! See ya next year! pic.twitter.com/ON5ydLFWNd — Josef Newgarden (@josefnewgarden) August 5, 2022

For the next three days, the two-time series champion said he would be focused entirely on the track.

“One hundred percent; I shut everything else down,” Newgarden said Thursday. “This event was a priority. I really wanted to raise some money for these great organizations, but other than that, I just want to run the race. So whatever else we don’t have to do, let’s not do. I tried to just give myself a little better opportunity.”

It’s a lesson learned from last season while running himself ragged during IndyCar’s first visit to Nashville. For four days, Newgarden embraced the role of primary ambassador for the inaugural Music City Grand Prix. In between fulfilling every appearance and interview request, he also was followed by a documentary crew that produced a 22-minute episode of “Off the Grid” about the star-crossed weekend (video above).

Newgarden crashed his No. 2 Dallara-Chevrolet in Turn 11 during qualifying and finished 10th after starting 12th.

His viewing of the documentary later was revelatory.

“I thought it was funny; you could sense the intensity on me on that weekend, a lot of the frustration,” Newgarden told NBC Sports during a preseason interview. “Nashville was a lot to take in, and I was surprised how much I extended myself out. I really thought I was going to be better at trying to prioritize the racing side of the weekend. I knew how important that was going to be and how much I was going to be pulled in every which direction. I think that got the better of me. … My focus was just pulled away from the track side too much. And when I was at the track and seeing the footage, you were seeing a lot of frustration from me. Being shelled in quite a bit.

“I wanted to hide more than anything that weekend. It was really hard to be in everybody’s eye, but that’s part of racing. You have to thrive in those moments. I think it was a teaching moment for me. I learned how I can cope with that and where I can set boundaries.”

There have been no boundaries on improving at Nashville, which Newgarden said was one his weakest tracks in 2021.

His team brought a radically new setup that showed promise with the fifth-fastest speed in practice Friday.

“We came with something that’s productive,” he said. “We need to work on it. I have a lot of faith that with this group here we can figure it out, have a good weekend, not let this be a negative in the last four (races of the season). I think we can have a great weekend here as a whole team.”

Newgarden is 32 points behind teammate Will Power with four races remaining after posting a fifth July 30 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course. He had been cleared to race only two days earlier after being hospitalized for a fall at Iowa Speedway, where he crashed from the lead while trying to complete a weekend sweep.

“I felt really good; I felt pretty normal,” Newgarden said. “I would probably say I wasn’t 100%, but I felt good. I felt normal in a lot of respects, but I’ve been trying to get myself even better. A top five was really strong for us. We needed to be in the race. I was happy to be there. I think we had more potential than fifth, but we have four races to go still. Plenty of time to make enough happen.”

Starting with what he hopes is a clean – and quiet – home weekend.

“I try not to make it more pressure-filled than any other race,” Newgarden said. “Every event we go to is a lot of pressure. We want to perform. Doesn’t matter what race it is. Clearly this is more special being from Nashville and to have this event here.

“We want people to come to Nashville and think of this as an event, a Super Bowl type event. So there’s a lot of pressure for it. I make it like any other race, any other day. Focus on my job. I think if you do that, you give yourself a better opportunity to just run the race you’d normally run and potentially win it.”"
376,nbc,sport,Felix Rosenqvist: Team distracted by McLaren uncertainty,"['distracted', 'uncertainty', 'think', 'felix', 'race', 'whats', 'going', 'team', 'rosenqvist', 'situation', 'mclaren', 'good', 'thats']","NASHVILLE, Tennessee – Though IndyCar’s biggest contract squabble involves another driver and team, it’s become such a distraction for Felix Rosenqvist and Arrow McLaren SP, it apparently now is impacting race results.
“We didn’t do a great job in the race,” Rosenqvist said Friday after turning the second-fastest lap in the opening practice for the Music City Grand Prix.
Meanwhile, Rosenqvist, who re-signed with McLaren in June, and his team members are left waiting.
For the Formula E stuff, I mean, I think that’s kind of secondary at this point.
Like we’ve never seen a case like this that’s going on right now.","NASHVILLE, Tennessee – Though IndyCar’s biggest contract squabble involves another driver and team, it’s become such a distraction for Felix Rosenqvist and Arrow McLaren SP, it apparently now is impacting race results.

Rosenqvist, who admits his future depends on the battle over the services of Alex Palou, said a team meeting was held this week to address a hugely disappointing ninth July 30 race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course. Rosenqvist’s No. 7 Dallara-Chevrolet started on pole position after outpacing the field by nearly three 10ths of a second in qualifying but then led only seven laps because of malfunctioning brakes.

“We didn’t do a great job in the race,” Rosenqvist said Friday after turning the second-fastest lap in the opening practice for the Music City Grand Prix. “ We had an issue with the brakes, they were dragging pretty much. Not the whole race, but from time to time they were dragging. It cost us the race pretty much. At least a podium would have been expected from that race the way it went. We were just like a sitting duck on the straights.

INDYCAR AT NASHVILLE: Schedules, details for watching this weekend on NBC

FRIDAY PRACTICE: Speeds from the weekend’s first session

“That’s a bad thing. I don’t know the exact explanation, but there was something going on inside of the caliper or something that wasn’t right. We had a meeting. I think everyone obviously is a bit tired after these long stretches of races. A doubleheader in Iowa, then straight into Indy GP, straight here. People are obviously tired. We get that.

“We just had a meeting to go through like is there anything we can do, something we need to address. We have a good car. We want to keep getting those results this year. I think it was a good meeting. It wasn’t finger pointing or anything. It was getting the group together, talking about it. Like we haven’t done good enough in certain areas, we need to address them so we can get some podiums.”

The problem for Rosenqvist, 30, and his team is so much has been out of their hands since July 12.

That was the day Palou was claimed to be under contract next year by McLaren and Chip Ganassi Racing, which has sued the defending series champion to ensure Palou is retained for the 2023 season.

Meanwhile, Rosenqvist, who re-signed with McLaren in June, and his team members are left waiting. McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown said Rosenqvist would be ticketed for Formula E next season if the team chooses to fill its new third seat in IndyCar with another driver alongside Pato O’Ward (who went through his own contract issues with McLaren before an extension in May) and Alexander Rossi.

During the team meeting this past week, Rosenqivst said the sticky situation was the elephant in the room.

“It’s mainly distracting for the team, for the engineers, mechanics,” he said. “They’re all asking questions. They’re part of this team as much as I am. Obviously without the driver, it’s a big part of what makes their day. They want to know, are they going to continue with me next year? What’s going to happen?

“It’s not the optimal case. I think we’ve done a good job focusing, but we had a run of mechanical failures, a bit of slipups here and there. I’m sure these things don’t help. For now we got together a couple days ago at the shop and said, ‘Let’s focus on the details here’ and try to use the performance we have right now to do some good finishes for the rest of the season, then everything else will pan out in time.”

The situation grew more complicated late Thursday when a report by RACER indicated that Rosenqvist actually could remain in IndyCar next year without staying at McLaren.

Asked to address his contract situation Friday, Rosenqvist said, “That’s between me and Zak, to be honest. I prefer not to talk about contracts. That’s why they’re contracts because they’re made for you and the other signing party. It’s not for the public to know.”

But if a situation unfolded where he is let out of an IndyCar ride with McLaren, would he pursue other opportunities?

“That we will see,” Rosenqvist said.

If all things could be equal, the Swede naturally would prefer to stay in IndyCar with Arrow McLaren SP.

Though he remains winless since his lone victory at Road America in July 2020, Rosenqvist is enjoying his finest overall season since his rookie campaign in 2019. He has a career-best two poles and average starting position of 8.5, ranking ninth in the championship through 13 of 17 races.

Aside from an early engine failure at Mid-Ohio (which ruined a fourth-place starting position) and a crash at Iowa, he has finished in the top 10 of every race the past three months (including a fourth in the Indy 500) while meshing well in his first full season with engineer Craig Hampson.

“As I say, we had a good run last couple of races,” Rosenqvist said. “I feel happy working with my engineer, my mechanics. Obviously it’s another car coming to the team next year. I think it’s all depending on the Palou case what’s going to happen with me.

“But, yeah, that’s all I’m focused on right now. I’m just trying to win the race. I think we’ve been close a couple times here. Just focus on doing well, winning races. That’s pretty much all I can do. For the Formula E stuff, I mean, I think that’s kind of secondary at this point. Mainly just focusing on what I’m doing here now, try not to get distracted by what’s going on in the background.”

But that’s easier said than done – particularly when every day seemingly brings a new surreal episode. This past week, McLaren mirrored the Palou situation in Formula One, reportedly agreeing to a deal with Oscar Piastri as the F2 champion was announced as Alpine’s driver for 2023 (Rosenqvist called it “a shock to see”).

On Thursday night in a charity ping pong tournament organized by Josef Newgarden, Rosenqvist played a few feet apart from Palou in a metaphorical intertwining of two careers that could end up bouncing in any direction.

It all can seem a little absurd, but Rosenqivst said he accepts what he can’t control while conceding the situation is “not optimal for our team and affects people in the organization. It’s not good.” His time in the McLaren engineering room after practice Friday was interrupted by being requested in the media center.

“Obviously it’s always complicated,” he said. “Half of these things don’t concern me at all. You read stuff. You also don’t know what’s true or not. There’s obviously a lot of rumors, people that think they know what’s going on. What’s actually the truth, that’s only the people involved that know.

“Is it very different? Yes. Like we’ve never seen a case like this that’s going on right now. Yeah, at least you guys get something to write about That’s a good thing in the end. As I say, as long as it’s not distracting us too much, I think we’re good. I’m just going to focus on what concerns me, and the rest is kind of pointless, to be honest.”

One thing that Rosenqvist knows for certain?

His under more pressure to be a professional amid the chaos to deliver results – and he’s learning that he actually thrives under the gun.

“When you don’t know what you’re going to do, it’s always important more to perform,” he said. “That’s just a fact. I think I respond well to that. I always have pressure, but I feel like I probably stepped up a little bit since things have become unclear. That’s a good thing.”

He paused to smile.

“Maybe I need to be in this situation all the time.”"

(3 p.m.
Newgarden is only slightly favored over Pato O’Ward at +440, despite that driver’s erratic finishes on street courses in the past two seasons.
Five of his last nine street course starts ended outside the top 10.
He scored a pair of street course wins in 2021, at St. Pete and Long Beach.
He slipped to 15th at Toronto, but rebounded to finish third on the permanent road course inside Indianapolis Motor Speedway last week.","Josef Newgarden is the PointsBet Sportsbook favorite for Sunday’s Big Machine Music City Grand Prix on the streets of Nashville, Tenn. (3 p.m. ET on NBC). For more details on how to watch, click here.

With a win at Long Beach this season and top-10s in all but one of the nine street courses during the past two years, Newgarden has shown a high degree of consistency on this track type, which accounts for his +425 odds. In addition to his win, the Team Penske driver has runner-up finishes at St. Petersburg, Belle Isle and Long Beach in 2021. Newgarden looks to cut into Will Power’s 32-point lead on his home track.

One way to view American Odds is to move the decimal point two positions to the left. That will let a bettor know what they will make on a $1 bet, so the return on investment this week for Newgarden is $4.25. For bettors more comfortable with fractional odds, a bet of +300 is the same as 3/1.

Newgarden is only slightly favored over Pato O’Ward at +440, despite that driver’s erratic finishes on street courses in the past two seasons. O’Ward has one win and four top-fives on temporary road courses in that span, with his most recent strong run ending fifth at Belle Isle. Five of his last nine street course starts ended outside the top 10.

Ranked third is Colton Herta with a line of +520. He scored a pair of street course wins in 2021, at St. Pete and Long Beach. While he has not added another street victory in 2022, he came close with a second-place finish in Toronto and has three top-10s in four starts on the course type this year.

Herta narrowly edges points’ leader Power at +540. Power swept the top-five in the first three street races this season and earned the victory at Belle Isle. He slipped to 15th at Toronto, but rebounded to finish third on the permanent road course inside Indianapolis Motor Speedway last week.

Rounding out the top five is Alex Palou with a line of +800. On combined road and street courses, Palou has eight results of sixth or better in his last 11 starts, including a win at Portland International Raceway last year.

Three other drivers are listed under 10/1 at PointsBet with Scott Dixon, last year’s Nashville winner Marcus Ericsson, and last week’s winner Alexander Rossi each posted at +850 – a line more double that of Newgarden.

He scored his first World of Outlaws Sprint Car win this June at Huset’s Speedway in Brandon, S.D.
In the tribute race to fallen racer Bryan Clauson, Kofoid decided early he would do whatever was necessary to win.
It was a good points night, but also even better that we won at probably the coolest track in the world.”With his 2022 BC39 win, Kofoid is now the fourth winner in as many editions of the race.","The list of winners at Indianapolis Motor Speedway continues to grow as Michael “Buddy” Kofoid held off Cannon McIntosh through a series of wild slide jobs in the closing laps of the 2022 Drive2SaveLives BC39 on the quarter-mile dirt track. With his eighth USAC Midget win of the season, Kofoid got to kiss the bricks embedded in the track’s retaining wall for what he described as “the biggest win of my midget career.”

After taking the lead from Mitchel Moles on Lap 13, McIntosh held the top spot until Lap 30. The lead would officially change hands three times before the end with Kofoid leading the final five laps, but that doesn’t even begin to tell the story. The final laps of the race featured slide jobs in nearly every turn, 10 times in a six-lap span, with the midgets bouncing off and over the cushion, and Kofoid clipping the wall on occasion.

“Some of it was intentional and some of it was on accident,” Kofoid said. “A lot of the time, it worked out. Luckily, I didn’t get bit. Hats off to Cannon. It was so fun racing with him. It was probably one of most fun midget races I’ve ever been a part of.”

Kofoid has been hot in 2022, winning three times in the USAC Sprint series and seven times previously in Midgets. He scored his first World of Outlaws Sprint Car win this June at Huset’s Speedway in Brandon, S.D. in his 16th start with them.

But the wins don’t get much bigger than the 2022 BC39 as Kofoid bested a field of more than 85 entries that included former winners Kyle Larson (2021) and Brady Bacon (2018), the best midget racers currently competing, plus NASCAR and IndyCar stars Ricky Stenhouse, Jr., Chase Briscoe and Zach Veach.

In the tribute race to fallen racer Bryan Clauson, Kofoid decided early he would do whatever was necessary to win.

“At first, I didn’t think the track was going to widen up enough,” Kofoid said. “I was kind of stuck in fourth and fifth, so I just started ripping the fence, and if I put it upside down, I put it upside down. Luckily, that didn’t happen. It was a good points night, but also even better that we won at probably the coolest track in the world.”

With his 2022 BC39 win, Kofoid is now the fourth winner in as many editions of the race.

An infield tire marker was clipped and pushed into the groove with three laps remaining, setting up one final, dramatic restart. McIntosh threw one final slider and took the lead briefly in the closing laps, but Kofoid would not be denied and retook the lead in Turn 2 before McIntosh could officially lead that circuit.

Last year’s second-place finisher Justin Grant joined the fray to briefly make for a three-wide battle for the lead in the final two laps before Thomas Meseraull slid into third behind Kofoid and McIntosh.

Grant finished fourth, making him the only driver to finish in the top 10 in all four editions of this race – and he had to battle his way through the C and B Mains to be in a position to do so. During the night, he passed 35 cars in route to his top-five finish.

And as for the NASCAR star Larson, he had the best view in the house before finishing fifth.

The 2018 winner Bacon finished eighth while Stenhouse was 19th and Briscoe 21st."

The 21-year-old Dutchman said on Twitter he was staying in the No. 21 Chevrolet, and unlike recent contract dealings in both IndyCar and Formula One, this one was backed minutes later when ECR confirmed the news.

VeeKay, who was permitted to talk to other teams as of Monday of this week, entered into free agency with a new agent this season. Rather than wait to see how the situation is resolved at Chip Ganassi Racing with reigning IndyCar champion Alex Palou, VeeKay decided to stay where he is and not gamble on the No. 10 at Ganassi possibly opening.

INDYCAR AT NASHVILLE: Schedules, details for watching this weekend on NBC

IndyCar rookie Callum Illot did the same last week when he honored a handshake deal with Juncos Hollinger Racing to return next year – even though the No. 10 could open if Palou finds a way out of his hotly contested contract. Ganassi is suing the Spaniard over a deal Palou signed to join McLaren Racing – although it’s not clear if that’s for an IndyCar or F1 seat.

“I am very excited to continue with Ed Carpenter Racing for what will be my fourth year,” VeeKay said. “Ed Carpenter gave me the opportunity to drive for the team when I came out of Indy Lights and has let me showcase my talents in an Indy car ever since.

“The continuity at ECR is great, there have barely been any changes in my time here, and it’s very nice to have the same group of people around me all the time.”

Very happy and proud to confirm that I have signed a multi-year agreement with Ed Carpenter Racing. I look forward to fight for more poles, podiums and wins together! @ECRIndy pic.twitter.com/0AswRXoazX — Rinus VeeKay (@rinusveekay) August 4, 2022

VeeKay was the 2020 IndyCar rookie of the year and scored his only career victory last year on the road course at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He’s since tattooed the date of that breakthrough victory on his bicep.

VeeKay has one pole this year, one podium finish, and is ranked 11th in the IndyCar standings headed into Sunday’s race in the downtown streets of Nashville. He’s twice qualified on the front row for the Indianapolis 500.

Team owner Ed Carpenter watched VeeKay progress through the Road to Indy, which included one championship, two runner-up finishes in the points standings, 16 wins and 36 podiums in just 48 races.

“I am so happy to be able to extend our relationship with Rinus, he is an extremely versatile and talented driver,” said Carpenter. “It has been and remains our hope to build our team to new heights with Rinus helping lead the charge. Our goals and expectations are to win races and to compete for championships. With Rinus’s growth and the support from BitNile and Todd Ault, we are primed for success.”

VeeKay becomes the longest-tenured, full-time driver in Ed Carpenter Racing’s 11-year history.

His extension comes amidst a flurry of crazed free agency in both IndyCar and F1. Ganassi said it picked up its option on Palou last month and then hours later Palou said he would not be returning to the team. Minutes after that, McLaren said it had signed Palou.

Just this week, the F1 dominoes began to fall when Fernando Alonso blindsided Alpine by signing with Aston Martin. The next day, Alpine said it was promoting reserve driver Oscar Piastri, only for the 21-year-old Australian to denounce the move.

Piastri is also believed to have a contract with McLaren, which gives McLaren far too many drivers for available seats. The Palou debacle is already in the court system; Piastri’s situation is less clear.

In IndyCar, several drivers are still attempting to finalize their 2023 plans, including seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson. He’d like to return for a third season of IndyCar but has yet to secure a commitment on funding from sponsor Carvana.

Four-time Indianapolis 500 winner Helio Castroneves is also still working on his future and wants to return for a full season with Meyer-Shank Racing. The Brazilian said he’s not interested in running Indy only for Shank and wants a full year.

Castroneves is also attempting to get a seat in NASCAR’s season-opening Daytona 500."

And they owe the tight battle to a dramatic come-from-behind run by Travis Wyman.

Stock car racing was built on the principle that fans wanted to see race vehicles that looked like the one they drove on the street. One equivalent in motorcycles is the MotoAmerica’s King of the Baggers series. That is not to imply these are stock bikes. Heavily modified engines, suspensions and other mechanicals make these true racing machines, but the Harley Davidson Road Glide and Indian Challenger that hit the track allow the everyday rider to visualize what their bikes would look like zooming around some of America’s iconic raceways.

The term baggers comes from the saddlebags each bike carries – and the bags are more than simply decorative. They change the balance of the bike and make for some twitchy corners, which in turn creates more passing opportunities.

Putting aside the uniqueness of these bikes, the proof of concept ultimately comes down to competitiveness. And that is where this division has exceled in its short existence.

Five riders have won in the first six rounds of the seven-race series. The rider with multiple wins, Kyle Wyman, was disqualified from the most recent race this past weekend for spilling oil onto Brainerd (Minn.) International Raceway. That effectively took him out of the running.

Meanwhile, his brother Travis earned his third consecutive podium finish and turned a one-point deficit entering Round 6 in the championship standings into a three-point lead.

For the new points leader, this has been a charge from behind. Finishing second to Tyler O’Hara in the season opener at Daytona International Speedway, Race 2 on that track cost him dearly. Wyman’s fifth to O’Hara’s second, left him with a 14-point deficit exiting the first pair of races. That grew to 20 points in April by the time the series tackled Road America.

Wyman’s first win of the season in Round 4 allowed him to erase some of the deficit. Three consecutive finishes of first or second gave him the lead and momentum.

With a five-point difference between first and second in the MotoAmerica King of the Baggers classification and another four points to third, Wyman’s late-season charge sets the stage for the finale in September at New Jersey Motorsports Park to be a winner-take-all race.

Just like threading a needle…a very big needle…Bobby Fong made an epic inside pass on @OHaraRacing in the @MissionFoodsUS King Of The Baggers race at @BIRrace. The overtake put Fong into the lead, and he went on to win his first Big Twins feature race of the season. #bagger pic.twitter.com/hAuXgHIP6U — MotoAmerica (@MotoAmerica) July 31, 2022

A crowd of 60,000 and the most-viewed IndyCar race on cable in at least two decades turned up last year to witness the first serving of hot laps with the city known for its hot chicken — confirming Penske Entertainment CEO Mark Miles’ assertion that “clearly, Nashville is the hottest city in America for sports and for big events.”

But the inaugural event also had its share of first-year miscues involving crowd control and some malfunctioning facilities. Water leaking onto the track from a suite’s overflowing air conditioner actually might have caused one car to spin and led to a lengthy midrace delay for cleanup.

INDYCAR AT NASHVILLE: Schedules, details for watching this weekend on NBC

That was among the nine caution flags for 33 of 80 laps in a race that took nearly two and a half hours to complete.

There certainly were memorable moments — namely Marcus Ericsson winning after going airborne on Lap 5 (and then outrunning pole-sitter Colton Herta, who crashed while chasing the lead with the dominant car) — but there also were enough traffic jams and track blockages to warrant some alterations.

11 turns. 2.1 miles. 1 bridge. #INDYCAR heads back to the #MusicCityGP this weekend. Watch the race on Sunday, August 7th at 3PM ET on @NBC and @PeacockTV. pic.twitter.com/gWIZgBGMoz — NTT INDYCAR SERIES (@IndyCar) August 4, 2022

NBC Sports recently interviewed Tony Cotman, who is the principal of the NZR Consulting firm that has overseen the design and construction of the Music City Grand Prix for the past two years.

As reviewed by Cotman, here are some of the significant tweaks that have been made for the second year on Nashville’s 11-turn, 2.1-mile course:

–The biggest change is the new restart zone, which now will be the long straightaway exiting the Korean War Veterans Memorial Bridge and into Turn 9. This was used for the start last year, but restarts were at the start-finish line.

The start and all restarts now will occur exiting the bridge into Turn 9, which IndyCar views as the best opportunity for passing.

The pole-sitter and leaders will have discretion on when they pick up the accelerator to lead the field to the green flag, which likely will happen around the apex of the bridge (IndyCar wants the majority of the 26-car field to be through Turn 8 when the green flies). Push to pass will become active three turns (or roughly half a lap) later when the field crosses the finish line.

Though it’s an IndyCar decision to relocate the restart zone, Cotman said it’s fully supported by Music City Grand Prix promoters who had lobbied to have the restart zone on the bridge last year because it’s in view of the majority of spectators watching from grandstands and suites.

“I think when you’re coming down off the bridge, not only is it quite the spectacle, but it’s the best corner for passing, realistically,” Cotman said.

The Turn 9 corner also has been narrowed from 85 to 60 feet with the construction of a new suite in front of the Exxon station on the drivers’ left entering the corner.

Being more toward 90 degrees instead of a sweeping corner, the new radius should be safer (with less chance of head-on collisions in a sideways spin) and slower, which could engender more passing through a bigger braking zone.

The new restart zone also should avoid the bottlenecks that erupted when the field was bunched entering and exiting Turn 11. Ericsson went airborne after colliding with Sebastien Bourdais because of the limited visibility.

“I just think that you just need a few corners to sort yourself out,” Cotman said. “We see it in any type of racing. The starts and restarts, everyone is trying to make some hay. And the (section) in front of the stadium (at the finish line) is narrow. Even though Turn 1 and 2 are quite wide for street circuit terms, they’re still narrow.

“When you’re getting multiple cars bottling up next to each other, someone just has to make a small mistake, lock up a brake, and you get what we had last year. I think there’ll be more nose to tail in front of the stadium. I’m not saying people won’t pass, because they’ll still dive in there, but I think it’ll be a little more sorted. It’s only a couple of more corners, but at least leading up to there, they’ll have a chance to have a go. And from a spectator standpoint, it’s better.”

–Turn 11, the final corner that comes out in front of Nissan Stadium, has been widened by 4 feet at the apex to provide a better slight line around the corner.

“That was quite a tight corner and someone could spin and not see it,” Cotman said. “If you spin, and the car is 16 feet long and the track is 30 feet wide, it doesn’t leave you a lot of room, especially parked in the middle.”

–About 100 feet of transitions on either side of the bridge have been repaved to provide a smoother ride. Cars probably won’t bottom out as much, particularly on the entry into the downtown section with Turn 4, but Cotman also noted it’s “a catch-22 because teams will keep lowering their cars as a result. You can make it as smooth as you want, and they’ll still find a bump, but this is definitely an improvement.”

–A major bump in Turn 5 has been reprofiled to ease the transition up the hill through the right-hander that leads into a turnaround.

–There are no significant changes to the pit lane, which can accommodate up to 28 cars with 40-foot stalls, but IndyCar has reduced the speed limit from 45 to 40 mph (about 3 seconds longer for the length of pit lane).

–Cotman said other track changes mostly will go unnoticed. Race control has been moved into the paddock from beneath the stadium, where radio reception was difficult last year. The Grand Prix also has added spectator gates and worked with staff to avoid some “first-year-teething problems” (e.g., spectator fences being breached; the leakage from suites onto the track).

“There were some silly things that happened to be tightened up,” Cotman said. “I’m sure it’ll be a lot better this year.”

A new “high-end multilevel suite” called Club RPM also has been constructed in Turn 3.

The track has been built over the past three weeks by a Nashville area crew of 15 working Sunday through Thursday from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. (no work is done on Friday and Saturday because of downtown traffic).

The FIA-approved fencing system was built by a Swiss company called Geobrugg, which has has provided mobile debris barriers for many other high-profile tracks globally (Spa, Red Bull Ring, Mugello, Estoril, Imola among others). The Nashville system consists of 2,150 barriers and debris fence panels, including 650 custom made for the bridge and its single center line.

Nashville marked Geobrugg’s debut with a street course, and the company since was hired to help with the new F1 Miami Grand Prix in May."

Rossi ended a 49-race losing streak with the victory. His No. 27 Dallara-Honda failed postrace inspection when it was discovered to be underweight. IndyCar said the water bottle was used instead of ballast, and the car failed to meet the minimum weight requirement.

“From a sporting perspective, the car met minimum requirements,” IndyCar President Jay Frye said. “From a technical perspective, the way they achieved the weight is not allowed. To meet minimum weight, the drink bottle and its contents were used as car ballast, which is not permitted and why the team is being fined and penalized.”

Rossi also was docked 20 points and dropped a spot to ninth in the championship standings. The Nevada City, California, native has four races remaining in a seven-season run with Andretti before leaving for Arrow McLaren SP next season.

“We regret the mistake and appreciate IndyCar’s understanding that the No. 27 was compliant during the race,” the team said in a statement, adding it looked forward to moving on to this weekend’s racing in Nashville.

His win Saturday ended a three-year losing streak that dated to Road America in Wisconsin in 2019 and spanned 1,133 days. The victory also helped him leave his No. 27 team on a positive note; almost 70% of Rossi’s team has been with him for his seven seasons driving for Andretti.

Rossi won the 100th running of the Indy 500 as a rookie in 2016. He’d returned to the United States that season after his time chasing a seat in Formula One came to an end. Rossi’s five races in the 2015 season make him the last American driver to compete in an F1 weekend."

Alonso surprised the team Monday when he informed Alpine he’ll move to Aston Martin next year. Alpine needed just one day to announce it would promote its 21-year-old budding talent to race alongside Esteban Ocon in 2023.

But the Melbourne native said that’s not happening.

“I understand that, without my agreement, Alpine F1 have put out a release late this afternoon that I am driving for them next year. This is wrong and I have not signed a contract with Alpine for 2023. I will not be driving for Alpine next year,” he wrote on Twitter.

The situation is reminiscent of the ongoing IndyCar contract dispute involving Chip Ganassi Racing, Alex Palou and McLaren Racing.

Alpine’s news release had not included any comments from Piastri. There has been speculation that the current F2 champion was working on a better deal with another team.

In Alpine’s announcement, team principal Otmar Szafnauer said Piastri is “a bright and rare talent” who is “more than capable of taking the step up to Formula 1.”

Aston Martin on Monday signed the 41-year-old Alonso, a two-time world champion, to replace Sebastian Vettel, who announced his retirement last week. Alonso’s contract with Alpine was ending this season.

It’s been a hectic six days of F1 “silly season” that opened ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix with Vettel announcing he’ll retire at the end of the year. Alpine said Alonso had not given the team any indication he was leaving as late as Sunday night after the race, and the Piastri promotion was quickly announced. Williams, meanwhile, said American driver Logan Sargeant will make his F1 debut when he runs the first practice session at the United States Grand Prix later this year. Sargeant, a current F2 driver from Florida, will be the first American to participate in an F1 weekend since Alexander Rossi in 2015.

Alpine said Piastri has already been undergoing “an intensive and comprehensive training program” this season to “prepare him for the next big step” into F1.

“As our reserve driver he has been exposed to the team at the track, factory and testing where he has shown the maturity, promise and speed to ensure his promotion to our second seat alongside Esteban,” Szafnauer said. “Together, we believe the duo will give us the continuity we need to achieve our longterm goal of challenging for wins and championships.”"

Ultimately winning by nearly two seconds, Bakkerud led every lap and made it look effortless.

The task was not as easy for the second- and third-place drivers. Larsson had mechanical problems in his heat and pulled over early. That forced him into the first semifinal and a win there put him into the main.

Larsson hounded Bakkerud for the first three laps, but on the tight course, he was not able to get a nose inside the leader. Looking for some clean air, Larsson decided to hit the Joker Lane on Lap 4 of the six-lap final, but he was a little too wide on entry and lost more than a second. Larsson held on to finish second, nearly two seconds behind the leader.

Johan Kristoffersson crossed the finish line first in his heat, but incurred a three-second penalty for hitting a course marker, which handed the win to Oliver Eriksson. Driving from the back of the grid in the main, he rounded out the podium after advancing through the Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ).

Fraser McConnell in fourth and Ole-Christian Veiby rounded out the top five.

It was a disappointing round for Travis Pastrana. He also experienced problems in his heat and failed to finish.

BUDAPEST, Hungary — Formula One champion Max Verstappen overcame a spin and his worst starting spot of the season to win the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday. His eighth win of the season pushed Verstappen’s lead to 80 points over Charles Leclerc as F1 heads into its midseason break.

Mercedes placed both its cars on the podium for the second consecutive race. Seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton carved his way from seventh to a second-place finish, and pole-sitter George Russell was third.

Carlos Sainz Jr. finished fourth in another disastrous day for Ferrari. Leclerc was sixth, one spot behind Sergio Perez of Red Bull.

It was Verstappen’s 28th career victory.

“Who would have thought when we woke up today we’d get this result? Amazing,” the Dutchman told his team.

Wow what a day! It was a crazy race, but we stayed calm and won! This feels absolutely amazing 🔥 The car was great and today we adapted to the circumstances really good, so our strategy worked out perfectly.

He qualified a season-worst 10th because of a loss of power Saturday, then did a 360-degree spin in Sunday’s race.

“Unbelievable Max, that is right up there with your best,” Red Bull team principal Christian Horner replied. “Fantastic.”

Russell, who started from the pole for the first time in his career, led 30 laps until Leclerc passed him on the outside as dark clouds rolled over the Hungaroring circuit and a light rain began to fall.

With Leclerc leading, Verstappen undercut for quicker tires. Ferrari made a mistake in choosing the more durable hard tires for Leclerc.

“These tires are (expletive),” Leclerc said.

Moments later, Verstappen lost grip and went 360 on track, allowing Sainz to take the lead from Hamilton. Leclerc passed Verstappen, only to lose position soon after because Verstappen had faster tires.

Ferrari botched Sainz’s next tire stop on Lap 47, taking too long to fit his rear left tire. Hamilton stayed out but was losing time to Verstappen as the rain increased.

Leclerc came in for a third tire change on Lap 55 as Ferrari’s bungled tactics resurfaced the week. Leclerc crashed when leading the French Grand Prix last week.

Lando Norris finished seventh for McLaren, Fernando Alonso was eighth and his Alpine teammate Esteban Ocon was ninth. Sebastian Vettel of Aston Martin was 10th.

“It’s unacceptable, the guy is getting threats towards his family and so on.”Masi regrets not seeking professional help.","BUDAPEST, Hungary — Formula One’s former race director Michael Masi has described the abuse, including death threats, he received on social media following last season’s controversial call at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Red Bull driver Max Verstappen won his first world title after overtaking Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton on the last lap following a heavily disputed restart procedure.

Hamilton led comfortably until a crash by Nicholas Latifi brought out the safety car with five laps remaining. Verstappen stopped under yellow flags for fresher tires, and Masi flipped his decision and let the five lapped drivers separating Verstappen from Hamilton pass the safety car under yellow. But not all eight, which would have taken longer.

Undertaking an investigation after feeling the title was in danger of being tarnished, governing body FIA concluded Masi had made a “human error” but acted in good faith. Masi was replaced in his role and then left the FIA entirely three weeks ago to relocate back to Australia.

In an interview with Australia’s NewsCorp, the 44-year-old Australian recalled feeling like “the most hated man in the world” as he revealed the level of hostility he endured online via hundreds of toxic messages.

“They were shocking. Racist, abusive, vile, they called me every name under the sun. And there were death threats. People saying they were going to come after me and my family,” Masi said in the interview. “And they kept on coming. Not just on my Facebook but also on my LinkedIn, which is supposed to be a professional platform for business. It was the same type of abuse.”

The interview Masi gave to the Sunday Telegraph carried screenshots of some of the messages, with Masi saying he was relieved not to have more social media platforms where people could attack him.

“Thankfully, I don’t have an Instagram account. Or Twitter, I don’t have any of that,” Masi said. “Being old-school I do however have Facebook, which I used to stay in touch with family and friends. I opened my messages that night to check in with them. I did not know I could receive them from people I did not know. But I was wrong. I was confronted with hundreds of messages.”

Masi tried initially to blank out all of it.

“I just thought I would ignore it and get on with it because I knew it could take me to a very dark place. I tried to cut myself off mentally and I thought I could,” he said. “I mostly kept it all to myself … The FIA knew but I think I downplayed it all to everyone, including them.”

But the toll on Masi’s mental health was already considerable.

“I remember walking down the street in London a day or two later. I thought I was okay until I started looking over my shoulder,” he said. “I was looking at people and wondering if they were going to get me.”

He fought a private inner battle as he dealt with the abuse in his own way.

“I only talked to my close family – but only briefly. I also lost my appetite,” he said. “It did have a physical effect but it was more mental. I just wanted to be in a bubble. I just wanted to be alone, which was very challenging.”

Red Bull team principal Christian Horner told The Associated Press in a recent interview that Masi had been treated terribly and the criticism was deeply unfair.

“To me that was tantamount to bullying. He was hung out to dry by a couple of teams, and I think that’s absolutely not right,” Horner told the AP. “It’s unacceptable, the guy is getting threats towards his family and so on.”

Masi regrets not seeking professional help.

“I probably should have,” he said. “I should have gone and spoken to someone in a professional sense. But in saying that, I had some amazing people around me that could see it and were checking in daily. I was super fortunate to have that support network.”

Masi is not able to talk about the decision itself because of a non-disclosure agreement with the FIA.

“The whole experience has made me a much stronger person,” he said. “I have just had the longest break in my professional career and I have used that time to reconnect with family and friends. I have also done all that self-maintenance you can neglect when you are in the grind.”"

IndyCar results, points after Indy road course: Alexander Rossi ended a 49-race winless streak Saturday in the NTT IndyCar Series, winning the Gallagher Grand Prix at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

Rossi’s eighth career victory came 1,133 days after his last on June 23, 2019 at Road America.

“It’s a relief, man,” said Rossi, who has four more races with Andretti Autosport before heading to Arrow McLaren SP. “It’s been so many things for so long. Thankfully something came our way.”

Rossi beat rookie Christian Lundgaard by 3.5441 seconds. Will Power took third and moved into the championship lead by nine points over Marcus Ericsson.

Rossi won Saturday on the road course at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where his 2016 victory in the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500 jump-started his American motorsports career. Rossi’s last victory was at Road America in the 10th race of the 2019 season.

“It’s a relief,” Rossi sighed on the victory podium. “There’s been support for me for so long. Shoutout to Andretti Autosport in their continued belief. We’ve still got some more to go, but this was a really great track for us to do it at – back at home in Indianapolis. That was really amazing.”

The long slump led him to seek a fresh start and the California native will leave Andretti at the end of his seventh season to drive next year for Arrow McLaren SP. It was Michael Andretti who gave Rossi a shot in IndyCar when he’d washed out of Formula One and returned to the United States seeking to continue his career.

Rossi’s surprise victory as a rookie in the celebrated 100th running of the Indy 500 made him a star and earned him loyal sponsorship that has weathered his long drought. Some of his issues the last three seasons have been team inflicted – errors, mechanical failures and a full Andretti team meltdown earlier this month at Mid-Ohio – and Saturday was hardly a perfect day for the organization.

Colton Herta controlled the early part of the race but slowed from the lead right before the halfway mark.

“Nothing I can do,” he radioed as he tried to cruise his underpowered Honda back to pit lane.

He later walked alone down pit lane back to the paddock as the race continued without him.

“Man that is sad,” Herta tweeted. “We showed what we can do, we’ll keep going til we win again.”

Man that is sad… 😔😔 We showed what we can do we’ll keep going till we win again👊🏻 pic.twitter.com/QJeklz3PZn — Colton Herta (@ColtonHerta) July 30, 2022

Rossi sympathized with his teammate.

“I do feel for Colton, I do. But I’m thankful something finally came our way,” Rossi said. “I think Colton was definitely strong, and we had pretty much the same race car, and that (battle) would’ve been interesting. But it was the 27’s turn. And that’s awesome.”

Meanwhile, Andretti rookie Devlin DeFrancesco drew the ire of Conor Daly as tempers flared when DeFrancesco ran Daly off the track.

“Devlin needs to be kicked out of this racing series! He’s an idiot!” Daly screamed over his radio.

""Devlin (Defrancesco) needs to be kicked out of this racing series. He's an IDIOT!""@ConorDaly22 wants to see the Andretti Autosport driver get the boot from #INDYCAR after this move on him. pic.twitter.com/x0LT2U4HYv — INDYCAR on NBC (@IndyCaronNBC) July 30, 2022

There’s been speculation that Michael Andretti is reconsidering bringing DeFrancesco back for a sophomore season.

Christian Lundgaard, a rookie from Denmark who made his IndyCar debut in this race a year ago, finished second to give Rahal Letterman Lanigan its first podium of the season. It also gave Honda-powered drivers a 1-2 finish.

Will Power finished third for Team Penske and the Chevrolet driver cycled back to the top of the IndyCar standings for the third time this season. He now holds a nine-point lead over Indianapolis 500 winner Marcus Ericsson, who started last and finished 11th.

Scott McLaughlin finished fourth and was followed by Josef Newgarden as the Penske drivers worked together to cross the finish line in a row. Newgarden was only cleared to race on Saturday by IndyCar’s medical staff after collapsing and hitting his head last Sunday at Iowa Speedway.

The race started with six drivers separated by 44 points with five races remaining in the IndyCar season. The six drivers are now separated by 52 points, with a 10th-place finish by reigning series champion Alex Palou costing him ground."

BUDAPEST, Hungary — George Russell stole the show Saturday at the Hungarian Grand Prix by earning his first career pole and first of the season for Mercedes – on the same day F1 champion and current points leader Max Verstappen qualified a season-worst 10th.

Russell screamed in celebration after a fast final qualifying lap helped him beat Ferrari drivers Carlos Sainz Jr. and Charles Leclerc.

“Whooooo, come on! Yes! Hahahaha. You beauty! You beauty!” yelled Russell before jumping into the arms of his engineers.

The pace was surprising becuase Russell claimed Mercedes’ second practice was “disastrous” on Friday, when Russell was about a full second slower than Leclerc’s leading time.

“For us as a team it’s massive. We were all here until 11 p.m. last night scratching our heads, and we all felt pretty lost,” Russell said. “To come back and grab pole position is an amazing feeling. We absolutely nailed today, 100%.”

Verstappen unleashed expletives as his qualifying bid was undone.

He struggled with grip then complained of having “no power … nothing works” on his second attempt.

“I still don’t know what it is. I need to talk to the team, but I hope everything is fixable,” Verstappen said. “I know this track is very hard to pass at, so we have to be patient. This year has shown that a lot of things can happen.”

The Hungaroring track, nestled amid rolling hills just outside of Budapest, dried out somewhat for afternoon qualifying following a huge downpour during the third practice.

Leclerc – who leads F1 with seven poles this season – crashed while leading the French GP last Sunday to hand Verstappen a win that gave the Dutchman a 63-point lead over Leclerc in the standings.

But now Leclerc has an ideal chance to close the gap on Sunday on one of F1’s hardest tracks for passing.

Verstappen’s Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez had a disappointing session and starts from 11th place.

“It’s been a bad day,” Perez said. “It’s certainly going to be difficult to overtake tomorrow.”

Lando Norris of McLaren qualified fourth followed by Esteban Ocon – last year’s winner – Alpine teammate Fernando Alonso and Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton, who is F1’s record holder with 103 poles.

Russell, who replaced Valtteri Bottas at Mercedes this year, landed his seat in part by overperforming for struggling backmarker Williams last year with an incredible performance in the wet to qualify second for the Belgian GP.

“Dare I say better than the Spa one?” Russell said. “This is what racing’s all about. This is why I want to become world champion.”

After a first pole, the British driver is eyeing a first win.

“Hopefully we can drive off into the sunset tomorrow. I’m already thinking of what I can do to win,” he said. “Saturday doesn’t mean a huge amount, Sunday is when the points and prizes are won.”

Russell has what it takes to reach the top, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff believes.

“This is one of many milestones to come. George is a champion in the making,” Wolff said. “We would never have put him in a Mercedes if he didn’t think he could become a world champion.”

Hamilton had some bad luck as his drag reduction system stuck.

“My DRS stopped working, which was frustrating after all the struggle we had to finally have the chance to fight for front row,” he said. “We didn’t know how strong our pace was and where it came from, so it’s a very positive day for us. Huge congratulations to George, it’s an amazing feeling to get your first pole.”

Sainz called his form “nothing special” and conceded Russell “deserves that pole,” while Leclerc said he “struggled massively in Q3” because “the tires were definitely not in the right window.”

At least he has Verstappen where he wants him, seven cars back.

“Max might take a few more laps to come to the front,” Leclerc said.

Drivers had earlier tackled a difficult rain-drenched third practice.

Aston Martin driver Sebastian Vettel lost the rear tires and went backward into the crash barriers, bringing out a red flag with about 10 minutes to go. The session restarted with four minutes left.

After the intense heat of Friday, rain began thundering down around midday and the Hungaroring was drenched by the 1 p.m. start.

The Ferraris were the first to go out and Leclerc slid as he missed a chicane.

As rain got even heavier and visibility worsened, Vettel – who is retiring at the end of the season – missed a turn and AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly just avoided a crash barrier then later did a 360 spin.

Russell said he was “struggling a lot,” Ricciardo spoke of having “absolutely no grip” and Haas driver Mick Schumacher complained his rear tires felt like they were slipping on ice.

Williams driver Nicholas Latifi surprised everyone by posting the fastest time on his final lap.

“I was wondering if that clapping was for me,” joked Latifi, who is last in the standings and yet to score a point.

That joy was short-lived as the Canadian driver was among the five eliminated from Q1, along with Vettel and Gasly.

“I’m gutted,” said Gasly, who had one of his lap times deleted for going off track limits, also at Turn 5.

Latifi starts last on Sunday."

For more details on how to watch , click here.

Rosenqvist earned his third career pole with a speed of 125.03 m.p.h. and charged to the top of the betting charts as well. He is listed at +360.

To pay off at that line, he will need to earn his second top-five on this track. Rosenqvist’s best finish on the Indy road course was fifth in the 2020 Indy Harvest GP. In 2019, he won the pole for this race while driving for Chip Ganassi before finishing eighth.

One way to view American Odds is to move the decimal point two positions to the left. That will let a bettor know what they will make on a $1 bet, so the return on investment this week for Rosenqvist is $3.60. For bettors more comfortable with fractional odds, a bet of +300 is the same as 3/1.

Also at +360, O’Ward also has a best finish of fifth on this track, but he has earned that twice in seven starts. One of these came in last year’s edition of this race after he led the field to green. O’Ward qualified third for Saturday’s race.

Alexander Rossi and Josef Newgarden each have lines of +450 in a tightly grouped top-five, suggesting that PointsBet’s traders believe this will be a wide-open affair.

Rossi has two podium finishes and four top-fives in 10 starts. His best effort of second came in the 2020 Harvest GP when he was more than 14 seconds behind Newgarden at the checkers.

Newgarden would most likely continue his streak of favored lines this week if not for an accident suffered at the end of last week’s race in Iowa. Newgarden was cleared to practice mid-week and after undergoing another evaluation, he was approved for all activity, but the disruption to his schedule is worth a few points to the betting line. Newgarden’s 2020 win is one of only three top-fives on this track.

Will Power rounds out the top five with a line of +540. He began the season with five consecutive top-fives on road courses that ended with a victory at Belle Isle. He has finished 15th or worse in two of the last three road course races. Power has five wins on this track, however, with the most recent coming in this race last year. He was third in the GMR Grand Prix this May behind Colton Herta (+1000).

By David Phillips

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Take all five classes in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, turn them loose on four of the most historic and challenging miles of racetrack in North America amid changing conditions with championship implications riding on the outcome, and what do you get? Two hours and 40 minutes of action-packed sports car racing otherwise known as the 2022 IMSA Fastlane SportsCar Weekend at Road America.

What did we learn?

Nobody Ever Claimed Racing Is Fair

If they did, they were wrong. That maxim was proven for the zillionth time on Sunday when JDC-Miller MotorSports’ gamble of switching the No. 5 Mustang Sampling Cadillac DPi-V.R to rain tires during an early full-course yellow paid off big time. Initially.

While the other five Daytona Prototype international (DPi) competitors tiptoed around a track that was alternately wet and damp on the slick tires with which they started the race, surefooted Richard Westbrook stormed into a huge lead on his grooved Michelins. Such was his pace that Westbrook was within sight of lapping the sixth-place DPi car when a full-course yellow was declared to clear a chunk of debris from the circuit.

Following the resulting pit stop shuffles and repositioning of the field by class, Westbrook’s three-plus-mile advantage evaporated as all six DPi cars were positioned nose-to-tail for the subsequent restart. With the JDC-Miller inspired gamble effectively nullified, Tristan Vautier spent the remainder of the race battling for position in a race he and Westbrook might well have easily won by putting a lap on the DPi field barring that full-course caution – a yellow caused when the sister (or is that cousin?) car, the No. 90 JDC-Miller Duqueine D08 Le Mans Prototype 3 entry, lost a chunk of its bodywork.

Racing fair? No. Ironic? Certainly.

Yin and Yang of Consistency

The yin and yang of consistency was much in evidence at Road America. After capturing the 2022 Rolex 24 At Daytona, Meyer Shank Racing with Curb-Agajanian has experienced a “so near yet so far” season, the No. 60 Acura ARX-05 consistently in the hunt for another win but just as regularly falling just short.

Thus, the No. 60 arrived at Road America with a string of five consecutive runner-up finishes. The regular collection of points enabled Meyer Shank to fashion a lead in the DPi standings that was at once substantial and fragile. Substantial enough that a win in Wisconsin would have built a comfortable championship lead heading to the Motul Petit Le Mans season finale; fragile enough that a lackluster finish coupled with a win by the chief rival No. 10 Konica Minolta Acura would force a must-win position in the season finale.

The late stages at Road America once again found the No. 60 Acura in the lead, with Oliver Jarvis battling to stay just ahead of Filipe Albuquerque in the No. 10. Not for the first time this year, Albuquerque pulled off a forceful – but clean – pass for the lead and went on to take the win. Meanwhile, under intense pressure from Earl Bamber in the No. 02 Cadillac Racing DPi V.R, Jarvis crashed in the Kink and was fortunate indeed that the resulting full-course yellow enabled him to nurse his badly damaged car to a fourth-place finish.

Thus, the No. 10 Konica Minolta Acura now heads to Motul Petit Le Mans with a 19-point lead over the No. 60 Meyer Shank Acura, putting MSR in that must-win situation.

Speaking of Consistency …

Stevan McAleer and Mike Skeen steered the No. 32 Team Korthoff Motorsports Mercedes-AMG GT3 to an eighth-place GT Daytona (GTD) finish Sunday, keeping McAleer and the No. 32 atop the GTD driver and team standings. After opening the season with third- and-second place finishes, respectively, at the Rolex 24 and Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring Presented by Advance Auto Parts, the Korthoff Mercedes has not scored another podium finish. On the other hand, Road America was just the second time this season that the No. 32 Mercedes finished outside the top six.

While some other GTD campaigners have experienced higher “highs,” they’ve also experienced more “lows.” With races at VIRginia International Raceway and Michelin Raceway Road Atlanta remaining on the schedule, that consistency finds McAleer and Team Korthoff 36 points clear of Ryan Hardwick, Jan Heylen and the No. 16 Wright Motorsports Porsche GT3 R, with three other teams within striking distance of the championship."

ELKHART LAKE, Wis. – Filipe Albuquerque saw an opening and went for it. His reward for the risk was victory Sunday and a renewed shot at the championship.

Albuquerque took the lead of the IMSA Fastlane SportsCar Weekend at Road America with help from a lapped car with 24 minutes left in the two-hour, 40-minute race, then held the lead to the finish.

The victory pushed Albuquerque and co-driver Ricky Taylor into the lead for the championship in the Daytona Prototype international (DPi) class and turned the season-ending Motul Petit Le Mans into a race for the title between two Acura teams.

“It feels good, but it never lasts long,” Taylor said. “What we’ve learned this year is if you have the points lead, you’re not safe. Every time we get it, it goes the other way again. It’s flip-flopped I don’t know how many times.”

It flip-flopped again when Albuquerque used traffic to pass Oliver Jarvis, who had been leading the race and the DPi standings to that point. Albuquerque pitched the No. 10 Konica Minolta Acura ARX-05 around a Grand Touring Daytona (GTD) car driven by Ryan Eversley and past the No. 60 Meyer Shank Racing Acura ARX-05 that Jarvis co-drives with Tom Blomqvist.

“I timed it perfectly and took a lot of risks going to the left with half the car on the grass,” Albuquerque said. “Then it was done. It was chaotic.”

With six-and-a-half minutes left, Jarvis crashed on the exit of Turn 10. He kept the car moving during the ensuing caution period, finishing fourth but losing the points lead to the No. 10 car, which will take a 19-point lead into Motul Petit Le Mans on Oct. 1.

Taylor found himself in a tricky situation during his first stint, as rain began to fall while he was on slicks. He managed to get the car back to the pits by Lap 30, but the lead was gone, and he had fallen back to eighth overall.

“I was just trying to survive,” Taylor said. “Honestly, I didn’t know if I was doing a very good job. I just saw that the guys on wets were gone. They asked what we wanted to do on the next stop and I said, ‘Put Filipe in.’”

Albuquerque began picking off one car after another, reaching fourth place by Lap 36, then second by Lap 47.

“We had more to lose,” Albuquerque said. “We had to stay ahead of the Shank car, and they were on rain tires and about a minute ahead of us. I was so desperate and angry about the situation because I could see us not winning it. Then it came around to us and we were back in the game.”

After Jarvis’ crash, the field stayed under caution to the finish, and Wayne Taylor Racing had its first victory at Road America and fourth win of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship season.

Earl Bamber finished second in the No. 02 Cadillac Racing Cadillac DPi-V.R he shares with Alex Lynn, while the No. 01 Cadillac Racing sister car co-driven by Sebastien Bourdais and Renger van der Zande finished third.

But the victory by the No. 10 Acura – and the return to the lead of the championship – was all about Albuquerque.

“If you give him the car in position, he’s going to go win it, and he did,” Taylor said. “We’re getting spoiled by Filipe, honestly. We don’t have to get out of pit lane first anymore, he just does it on the racetrack. We need to keep ourselves realistic. He’s not a normal driver, (but) that’s not always going to happen. He’s just been working some serious magic this year.”

The magic will be called upon again at Michelin Raceway Road Atlanta, the final race for the DPi class before it is replaced by the Grand Touring Prototype (GTP) class at the Rolex 24 in January.

Dalziel Delivers Decisively for LMP2 Win in No. 18 Era Motorsport ORECA

Ryan Dalziel has developed quite the love affair for Road America. The Scotsman pulled off the decisive pass for the lead with 11 minutes left in Sunday’s race and went on to claim the Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) win with co-driver Dwight Merriman in the No. 18 Era Motorsport ORECA LMP2 07.

It gave the duo their second straight LMP2 win at the Wisconsin circuit, the 13th IMSA career top-tier series victory for Dalziel and the third for Merriman.

“Since I kind of moved to the States back in 2003, this has always been one of those tracks that always seemed to have clicked with me,” Dalziel said.

Dalziel hounded LMP2 leader Louis Deletraz in the No. 8 Tower Motorsport ORECA after a race restart from full-course caution with 36 minutes to go. Both were in fuel-save mode but Dalziel still found his chance to overtake Deletraz in the Canada Corner section of the 4.048-mile track. Two laps later, another yellow flag waved when the No. 60 Acura made contact with the wall in Turn 11 and the race ended under caution.

“We were trying to save fuel and it seemed like we were able to save a little easier than (Deletraz) was,” Dalziel explained. “The team were somewhat telling me to hang tight and try to pass him in the pits, but I just saw an opportunity and it happened.

“He had a bad run out of the Carousel and I had a pretty good run on him. He chose the middle and I chose the right, then he moved a little bit and then I moved him.”

With all cars starting the race on dry-condition tires but rain making an early appearance, conditions became quickly dicey. But Merriman held strong in the opening stint, moving up three positions to second before making a pit stop and turning the car over to Dalziel 40 minutes into the race.

“It was a little tricky,” Merriman said. “We were on slick tires and trying to get a feel for it. Managed to get up to P2 by the end of the stint, which was great. I tried not to make any mistakes and find some pace.”

Deletraz dominated the middle of the race, leading 37 laps until Dalziel pulled off the late pass for the win. By finishing second, the No. 8 and co-driver John Farano retained the LMP2 points lead, though it was trimmed to 33 points over Dalziel, Merriman and the No. 18 with only the Motul Petit Le Mans at Michelin Raceway Road Atlanta remaining.

Robinson and Fraga Rock in LMP3

It looked routine for Felipe Fraga and Gar Robinson. It most certainly was not.

Fraga and Robinson held it together through changing weather conditions to win the Le Mans Prototype 3 (LMP3) class, the first at the 14-turn, 4,048-mile circuit and the third at the track for Riley Motorsports.

“That was more stressful than the (Rolex 24),” Robinson said. “Ever since I’ve come up here, you test and you’re fast in qualifying, and then it rains. And if you’re not fast, the weather will be perfect. Or it’ll be perfect, and you’ll be fast, and some crazy yellow will come out. This is one of hardest races I’ve ever tried to win.”

Fraga’s stint in the rain put the No. 74 Riley Motorsports Ligier JS P320 in the lead, and he kept it there for the team’s third win of the season.

“It wasn’t smooth, but the team always called the right strategy,” Fraga said. “The car was perfect – very good to drive in the rain and very good to drive in the dry. I just brought it home. It wasn’t easy. It was tense.”

The No. 13 AWA co-driven by Orey Fidani and Matthew Bell finished second, with the No. 54 CORE Autosport co-driven by Jon Bennett and Colin Braun in third."

ELKHART LAKE, Wis. – Weather conditions varied throughout the IMSA Fastlane SportsCar Weekend at Road America. But the GTD PRO class of the two-hour, 40-minute race Sunday featured one constant – domination by the No. 14 Lexus RC F GT3 driven by Jack Hawksworth and Ben Barnicoat.

The pair of British drivers teamed up to lead 51 of the 62 laps completed of the classic 4.048-mile Wisconsin road course to claim their first victory together of the 2022 season. They won by 0.760 second over GTD PRO championship leaders Matt Campbell and Mathieu Jaminet in the No. 9 Pfaff Motorsports Porsche 911 GT3R, with Antonio Garcia and Jordan Taylor taking third place in the No. 3 Corvette Racing Corvette C8.R.

Hawksworth earned the Motul Pole Award Saturday at a track where the Lexus has traditionally excelled. He led the opening stint of the race, handing off to Barnicoat after 40 minutes when the first of four full course cautions flew.

Switching to Michelin rain tires from slicks, Barnicoat briefly lost the lead to Jaminet in the Pfaff Porsche. But the shower was brief, requiring a switch back to dry tires at the next round of yellow flag pit stops.

Barnicoat took the lead soon after the subsequent restart, with one hour and eight minutes remaining in the timed race. Jaminet was able to keep the Lexus within a second, but never seriously challenged as Barnicoat scored his second career IMSA win, and his first in GTD PRO.

Hawksworth now owns eight career WeatherTech Championship race wins.

“That was definitely I’d say the toughest race I’ve ever done,” said Barnicoat. “I’d never really done a lot of driving in this car in the wet before, and I made a mistake and the No. 9 got past me. I was really determined not to let that get that better of us.

“The fuel number I had to hit for the strategy was just crazy,” he added. “We knew it was going to be an extreme challenge, and to keep him behind while doing that was the toughest thing I’ve ever done. The yellow at the end fell for us and I was able to hold him off.”

Jaminet said he was disappointed to see the caution fly with less than 10 minutes remaining, but he admitted that he was unlikely to be able to pass Barnicoat unless the Lexus ran into a problem.

“It seemed like they found the right switch at the end to get some extra top speed they didn’t have at the beginning,” Jaminet commented. “We’ve been sometimes lucky this year and today was maybe a bit against us.

“All in all, it was a good race, and P2 is quite good for our championship with only two rounds to go.”

With the Road America victory, Barnicoat, who ranks second in the GTD PRO standings to Campbell and Jaminet, closed the gap slightly. But the Porsche duo still hold a comfortable 227-point cushion as the season winds down.

Ward, Ellis Seal the Deal for No. 57 Mercedes Team in GTD

Russell Ward and Philip Ellis played the stealth game to nab the GTD class victory at Road America in the No. 57 Winward Racing Mercedes-AMG GT GT3.

Ward ran the first 40 minutes of the two-hour, 40-minute WeatherTech Championship clash before handing the car off to Ellis. But the team elected to keep Ellis on slick tires at a time when the track was damp and most of his competitors were on Michelin rain tires.

Ellis completed a treacherous stint without making an unplanned pit stop to change tires, assisted by a timely full course caution.

“That’s when it started to turn for us,” Ward remarked. “We still had to overtake a couple cars and jump guys in pit lane, so it wasn’t an easy battle. The strategy was good, and the pit stops were great.”

Ellis took the lead on the 46th of the 60 laps the GTD class completed and was comfortably in front when a late accident caused the race to end under yellow.

Robert Megennis and Jeff Westphal finished second in the No. 39 CarBahn with Peregrine Racing Lamborghini Huracán GT3, while Frankie Montecalvo and Aaron Telitz capped a great day for Lexus by taking the final podium finish in the No. 12 RC F GT3.

“We were still on slicks when everybody else was on rain tires and immediately fell to the back of the field,” said Ellis. “I just tried to stay alive on slicks, so we didn’t have to make an extra pit stop. Then we gambled for the second full course yellow, and that kind of saved us at the end.”

“Philip was the star,” added Ward. “This has been coming, and it feels good.”

GTD points leader Steven McAleer finished eighth in the No. 32 Team Korthoff Motorsports Mercedes, immediately behind his closest pursuers, Ryan Hardwick and Jan Heylen in the No. 16 Wright Motorsports Porsche. McAleer has a 36-point advantage with two races remaining in the 2022 campaign; three other teams remain within 100 points.

IMSA’s GTD PRO and GTD classes headline the Michelin GT Challenge at VIRginia International Raceway, August 26-28. The 2022 IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship wraps up with the Motul Petit Le Mans, Sept. 28-Oct. 1 at Michelin Raceway Road Atlanta."

By Mark Robinson

Race 2 Results

ELKHART LAKE, Wis. – Neither race was easy but Loris Spinelli and Giano Taurino completed a weekend sweep of Lamborghini Super Trofeo North America, winning both races at Road America. The second victory came in difficult conditions Sunday that included a red-flag stoppage and mandate for teams to change to wet-condition tires.

Starting ninth overall in the No. 88 Taurino Racing by D Motorsports, Lamborghini Palm Beach Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo Evo2, Taurino moved into the top six before making the mandatory pit stop and turning over the car for Spinelli to finish the 50-minute race.

A full-course caution came soon after, when several cars slid off course in Turn 12 as heavy rain pelted that area of the track. The race was red-flagged with 17 minutes, 17 seconds to go, with Spinelli saddled in 12th place.

The Italian relied on his extensive wet-weather racing experience to slice through the field after racing resumed. He crossed the finish line second behind Nelson Piquet Jr. (No. 30 Ansa Motorsports, Lamborghini Broward Huracán), who was assessed a postrace penalty for not making the mandatory pit stop and relegated to 22nd in the standings.

“This race for sure has been a real challenge for the weather,” Spinelli said. “I’m so happy! I fight in the end to get this win. Thanks to Giano for an amazing stint in the first part and everybody at Taurino for this. Some parts of the track were very wet, so (the red flag) was the best way to choose to have a safe race. But it was hard to keep the car on the track.”

The margin of victory for Spinelli and Taurino was a scant 0.757 seconds over Joel Miller, making his series debut this weekend in the No. 11 Flying Lizard Motorsports, Lamborghini Newport Beach Huracán. Sunday’s win for the No. 88 followed the triumph in Saturday’s first race dominated by full-course cautions.

“It’s an amazing feeling,” Taurino said of the sweep. “My heart’s still shaking, I still have butterflies. It was unexpected because we’ve been struggling all year and we finally have found a car that can help us fight now. I think this is only the beginning.”

Bryson Lew and John Dubets completed a weekend sweep in ProAm as well, winning both class races in the No. 46 Precision Performance Motorsports, Lamborghini Palm Beach Huracán. The duo took third place overall Sunday and won their class by more than 16 seconds.

“I had a little bit of excitement there,” said Dubets, who started the race. “I was behind Piquet, we came into Canada Corner and it started downpouring. We both went for a wild ride. Luckily, our car stayed on track and we managed to catch the pit lane before it closed. (It) put Bryson in the perfect spot to go out there in front of the field and he did an excellent job in those tricky conditions.”

“It feels great to be back on the podium, on the top step especially,” Lew added. “John told me to be careful with all the lines, with the oil and the rain. I made sure to be cautious the first pace lap and I just implemented that throughout the race. It worked out great.”

The Am class winner Sunday was Shehan Chandrasoma in the No. 19 MCR racing, Lamborghini Austin Huracán. The Super Trofeo rookie gained his third win of the season.

“It was a good race,” Chandrasoma said. “I lost two spots in the end in the overall, but I just decided to stay safe in my Am class. That’s what I’m competing for and I think I’m back in the championship hunt now.”

LB Cup provided a sensational story with Keawn Tandon taking the class win in his first car racing weekend. The 18-year-old’s previous experience all came in karting. He didn’t know he would be competing in Lamborghini Super Trofeo until Thursday, when he took his first shakedown laps in the No. 89 NTE Sport, Lamborghini San Francisco Huracán.

“It was amazing; I’m still processing it,” Tandon said. “The biggest thing was just to stay clean the whole time and get the thing rotated and back to power as soon as possible, and just stay out of traffic. After they told me I was P1 in my class, the last three laps I just let off and said, ‘Let’s just keep it like this.’”

Unofficial class leaders after eight of 12 races are:

Pro: Kyle Marcelli and Danny Formal, No. 1 Prestige Performance with Wayne Taylor Racing Lamborghini Paramus Huracán, by 26 points over Edoardo Piscopo and Patrick Kujala, No. 50 O’Gara Motorsport/Change Racing/US RaceTronics, Lamborghini Beverly Hills Huracán.

Now he’s about to be showcased in a new light in Minnesota, which is why he is the early betting favorite to win NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Again. It would be his fourth.

NBC’s partner at Points Bet has its early odds out for the 2023 DPOY award and there are a lot of familiar names at the top of the list with Gobert. Here are the top 10:

Rudy Gobert +500

Robert Williams III +650

Bam Adebayo +800

Giannis Antetokounmpo +800

Draymond Green +800

Anthony Davis +1000

Mikal Bridges +1200

Myles Turner +1600

Joel Embed +2500

Jarrett Allen +2500

A few thoughts on that list:

• Gobert deserves to be No. 1. There will be no taking his defense for granted this season.

• Notice reigning DPOY Marcus Smart is not in the top 10, he is +3000. While I think it’s unlikely that he will win the award back-to-back, he’s still a quarterback and a key part of a Celtics’ defense that will be near the top of the league. Those odds seem long.

• If Robert Williams III can stay healthy, he might be the Celtic to win the award this year.

• My early pick: Bam Adebayo. With P.J. Tucker now in Philly, more will be asked of Adebayo and this may be his year to step out and win the award.

• If Anthony Davis is playing well enough to be in the mix to win this award, the Lakers will be better than projected.

• Those are some long odds for Joel Embiid, one of the league’s best rim protectors and defensive big men. He’s got more help in Philly this season, but this is the man in the MVP mix who could win this award if the 76ers’ defense is better than expected.

• Myles Turner could also be a good value bet, depending on if and where he gets traded. He led the league in blocked shots per game last season and is a quality paint protector, if he ends up on a team that desperately needs those skills, he could be showcased and in the mix for the award."

PHOENIX (AP) — Phoenix Mercury guard Diana Taurasi will miss the remainder of the season with a quadriceps strain.

Taurasi missed the last two games with the injury and the team announced Monday that the WNBA’s all-time leading scorer will not be available as the Mercury fight for a 10th straight playoff appearance.

A five-time Olympic gold medalist and three-time WNBA champion, Taurasi averaged 16.7 points and 3.9 assists this season, her 17th in the WNBA. Phoenix signed Yvonne Turner to a hardship contract to fill Taurasi’s roster spot.

Phoenix has played all season without center Brittney Griner, who has been detained in Russia since Feb. 17 after police at a Moscow airport said they found vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison last week, but U.S. officials are hoping to bring her home in a prisoner swap.

The Mercury are one of six teams fighting for the final three WNBA playoff spots heading into the final week of the season. It is unclear if Taurasi could play even if the Mercury do make the playoffs.

A source close to the Nets organization indicated Durant is not the only Nets star unhappy with the team’s leadership. “Kyrie Irving hates these guys,” the source said. “He feels that Nash is terrible and Marks is bad.” “KD came to the same conclusion,” the source added.

Irving and Durant remain tight. Does it surprise anyone that if one is unhappy, the other is unhappy? That’s how we all are with our close friends.

While we can debate the merits of Marks and Nash and the job they have done (Nash, in particular, has some around the NBA questioning if he is right for this job), most of Durant and Irving’s dissatisfaction appears to stem from the fact Marks would not give the unreliable Irving a long-term contract extension. After the drama around Irving and missed games the past couple of seasons — including his decision not to get vaccinated and with that miss much of last NBA season due to the vaccine mandate in New York City — Marks (and, no doubt Tsai) decided they were not going to max out Irving long term. Irving went looking for another team that would offer him a contract to force the Nets’ hand and found only the Lakers offering a Russell Westbrook trade that didn’t appeal to Brooklyn.

Irving was frustrated, and by extension his close friend Durant was frustrated, and things spiraled from there.

Irving and Durant can be as discontent and potentially resentful as they want, it doesn’t change the fact there is no movement on the trade front for either of them. After Durant’s latest trade demand, the teams interested in him will not up their offers (this public move robbed the Nets of leverage). The trade market for Irving remains singular — it’s still just the Lakers. Which is why the talk of Irving returning and playing out the season with the Nets — he knows he needs to get on the court and perform at the All-NBA levels he is fully capable of to build up his market.

With camps not opening until Sept. 27, teams have little pressure to get anything done right now. That pressure will ramp up next month and camps get closer than open (with or without Durant showing up to Brooklyn’s), but right now, while there is a lot of talk on social and traditional media about Durant and Irving, there isn’t a lot of conversation around the league. So this is still going to drag out for a while."

While the WNBA has upped its marketing game, it is not spending on players commensurate with their worth.
If the WNBA wants to reach the next level of fan acceptance, it has to start treating its players like the elite-level athletes they are.","Last season, the WNBA fined Joe and Clara Wu Tsai $500,000 for having the audacity to book a private charter jet to fly the New York Liberty players between games. You know, exactly how every NBA and major college basketball team flies between games — that’s a violation in the WNBA. Players have to fly commercial and if some teams have charter flights it’s seen as a competitive advantage.

Which is how you end up with high-level professional athletes having to sleep in an airport.

After the Los Angles Sparks knocked off the Washington Mystics on Sunday night to keep their playoff dreams alive, the players went to the airport to find their flight home was canceled and rescheduled for 9 a.m. The Sparks were without lodging for the night, and the only hotel with rooms near the airport could handle about half the players, leaving Sparks players sleeping in the airport.

This is unacceptable. The WNBA has to do better. This is not how to treat elite athletes.

The Tsais getting fined last year was part of a larger split and issue facing the WNBA. There is a divide in ownership between a new guard like Tsais who are both willing and have the means to spend big on the league player care — charter flights being part of that — and are taking a “you have to spend money to make money” approach to the WNBA. They see a league that can grow, but the plant needs to be watered. Then there is an older guard of ownership that says growth has to be slower and tied more to revenue (not necessarily profit, but reduced losses). This is how the WNBA has largely been run since its inception.

While the WNBA has upped its marketing game, it is not spending on players commensurate with their worth. That’s why you have WNBA players having no offseason because they spend their winters playing in Europe — or, in the case of Brittney Griner and others, Russia — because they make three or four times more there for a season than they do in the USA.

All the fantastic stories and impressive athletic feats the WNBA tries to highlight get undercut when images of players sleeping in airports show up on social media. The WNBA must aspire to more than the 1960s NBA. If the WNBA wants to reach the next level of fan acceptance, it has to start treating its players like the elite-level athletes they are.

Not having them spend the night in airports would be a good start."

The NBA did not mandate vaccination for players last season, still more than 97% of players did get the shot (how many have gotten subsequent boosters is unknown). There were a few holdouts, most notably Kyrie Irving of the Brooklyn Nets, but after New York modified its vaccination policy, he could play home games in Brooklyn at the end of the season and through the playoffs.

This is obviously a consideration for the Raptors, who had all their players vaccinated last season and are largely bringing back the same core. Teams with unvaccinated players can adapt for a game during the season. However, things will get interesting if the mandate is in place come the playoffs and a team with an unvaccinated player or players faces the Raptors.

But a lot of things could change between now and next April."

This is undoubtedly for the veteran minimum, and we will find out in the next 48 hours if it is fully or partially guaranteed.

Bazemore was a veteran leader on a young Kings team for part of the 2019-20 season. Last season he signed with the Lakers (instead of the Warriors) as a switchable 3&D wing. However, shot around 30% from 3 for much of the season and started to lose minutes to Avery Bradley (a Frank Vogel favorite). Then eventually Malik Monk and Austin Reeves proved to be better wing options and Bazemore was out of the rotation.

In Sacramento he can play some at the three behind Harrison Barnes, plus some two (although new coach Mike Brown will have a lot of wing and shooting options this season).

But in a sign of how at peace Bird is with her decision, she said when hearing the chant now, her primary thought is, “nice try.
Another sign that Bird knows she made the right decision came after she pressed the button to announce her decision.","Now that a bit of time has passed, Sue Bird knows she made the right decision announcing publicly what she knew inside — that this would be her last season.

But the emotions that are likely to come when she plays what could be her final game in Seattle? Bird has no idea what that’ll be like.

“I’m looking forward to it. That’s for sure,” she said. “I know it’s going to be a really special day. Am I ready for it? I guess we’ll see. It’s gonna be a lot, in all the good ways.”

Bird will play the final regular-season home game of her career on Sunday when the Seattle Storm host the Las Vegas Aces (3 p.m. Eastern on ABC). The Storm have clinched a playoff spot, but with the WNBA’s new playoff format, there’s no guarantee the Storm will end up with a home game in the first round.

Seattle is currently the No. 4 seed ahead of Washington with a week left in the regular season.

So in case the Storm don’t end up seeing their home floor again in the playoffs, Sunday is the day Bird gets feted for her remarkable career. Members of Seattle’s previous championships teams are expected to be in attendance. There will be a pregame ceremony. And the largest crowd in Storm history — more than 18,000 at Climate Pledge Arena — is expected.

“What she’s been able to do in her career, on and off the court, has been phenomenal and I don’t think they’ll ever be anyone like her,” former Seattle teammate Lauren Jackson said this week. “I think the legacy that she’s left on the sport, and that she’ll be leaving on the sport, is enormous. But I’m really excited to see what she does next.”

The 41-year-old Bird, the oldest player in the WNBA, announced in June that this would be her final season before retiring. The decision was expected, especially after Bird flirted with the idea of stepping away after last season before returning for a 19th season on the court and 21st overall with Seattle, missing two seasons due to injuries.

She’ll conclude her career as one of the most decorated players of all-time: four WNBA titles, five Olympic gold medals, countless WNBA records that may never be matched and recognition as one of the great women’s players during a golden generation for the league.

“If you want to talk the best generation (the league) is still pretty young, so we can revisit that conversation in like 20, 30, 40, 50 years,” Bird said. “But as it stands right now, I do feel really lucky that I played in the generation I played in, and I do think a huge chunk there is probably going to go down as the best, most talented.”

Last year when Seattle’s season ended at home with a playoff loss to Phoenix and Storm fans chanted “one more year!” the passionate plea resonated with Bird. She’s cited that moment numerous times over the past year as a partial reason for her decision to return.

But in a sign of how at peace Bird is with her decision, she said when hearing the chant now, her primary thought is, “nice try. See you later,” she joked.

Another sign that Bird knows she made the right decision came after she pressed the button to announce her decision. Instantly, the question of whether she’d play again was gone and with it an unknown weight that hung over her.

That’s led to more open and honest conversations with competitors, former teammates and fans without dancing around the uncomfortable unknown as the final days of her career have ticked closer.

“There were these other nice byproducts I didn’t expect. Most of it comes in the form of people being able to share moments with me, or memories with me. Probably the most meaningful is your peers,” Bird said. “Players on the other team sharing things with me, whether it’s an actual moment or how I’ve inspired them, how they looked up to me, ‘how the WNBA won’t be the same without you.’ I didn’t do it to get that. But that has been really nice. And it really does help. It’s part of my own closure and it’ll help me move on when it’s all said and done.”"

This offseason conditioning has been more of a focus, one of his Slovenian trainers, Anze Macek, told SportKlub Slovenija (hat tip to BasketNews.com).

“Shortly after the end of the season, he contacted me and said that he wanted to start fitness training immediately. Together with Goran Dragic, they worked for three weeks,” Macek said… “The national team action followed. When he went on vacation, he asked me for a work plan.” “He remains active,” he said. “I am in contact with him almost on a daily basis. He keeps his shape. He will improve everything during the national team practices where he will prepare with maximum effort.”

In photos this summer, Doncic has appeared thinner and more in shape, although offseason workout photos/videos/Instagram stories are notoriously edited and not always an accurate representation. Macek later said that the criticism of his conditioning drove Doncic this offseason.

He’s also around the age (23 and entering his fifth NBA season) where a lot of NBA players start to take their conditioning more seriously. From the time they were playing high school and AAU, many NBA players could roll out of bed, hit the gym a little, and be better than everyone regardless of what they ate or drank. Doncic did the same thing in Europe. But after a few years in the league, players realize if they want to extend their careers for as long as they can, if they’re going to reach the highest levels of the sport, they have to take better care of their bodies. Around Doncic’s age, players stop grabbing a pizza for dinner and start focusing on healthy meals, adhere to the training programs teams have given them, and get serious. It sounds as if Doncic is there.

Which is bad news for the rest of the league."

Does that put pressure on the Lakers to find a deal before camp opens? In his Lakers’ mailbag at The Athletic, Jovan Buha put it well, calling the start of training camp a “soft deadline.”

… there will come a time in which the Lakers have to decide if they’re willing to continue to play hardball and risk missing their window to trade Westbrook. There is a sense among some that training camp is a soft deadline to move Westbrook. If he’s on the roster in late September, there will be a massive off-court distraction, with the media asking about his future, his relationship with James and the organization, Ham’s vision of his role and responsibilities. This isn’t going to go away. That’s not the primary reason the Lakers should trade Westbrook — it’s because he’s not performing up to his gigantic contract and is a subpar fit as a third option — but it’s certainly an ancillary motivation.

The Lakers have refused to put both of their available first-round picks — 2027 and 2029 — in any trade offer so far, most notably for Brooklyn’s Kyrie Irving or Indiana’s duo of Buddy Hield and Myles Turner. (The Lakers reportedly would prefer the Irving trade, but the Nets want to deal with the Kevin Durant trade request before turning to Irving, so that remains on the back burner.)

If Rob Pelinka wants to get a Westbrook trade done before the soft deadline of media day — and very likely at any point, including in February at the trade deadline — it will take both picks. Are the Lakers sticking to their guns on this one and keeping at least one of those picks, or are they willing to go all in? If LeBron James signs a contract extension (meaning he is not a free agent after this season), are the Lakers more comfortable throwing both picks in a deal?

Or is media day going to be a rash of questions about LeBron’s relationship with Westbrook, and how new coach Darvin Ham plans to get Westbrook to play defense and make sacrifices Frank Vogel could not?

They just max extended Zach LaVine, plus the trio of DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso are locked up for this season and next. Patrick Williams becomes extension eligible after this season if the Bulls want to secure his services as well.

Then there is Nikola Vucevic, who was once considered part of that core but now draws more shrugs. The former All-Star center averaged 17.6 points and 11 rebounds a game last season, and he can space the floor as a pick-and-pop big (although he shot 31.4% from 3 last season), but he is not a shot blocker, doesn’t move well laterally, and is a target on the defensive end. He does not look like the center of the future in Chicago.

But they might extend him anyway at the right price, according to a report from Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times.

…a source said both sides want him to stay with the team beyond the last year of his contract this coming season and will have initial discussions on what that might look like when training camp begins in the fall. Why? Because if the price is right, Vucevic remains the type of player who fits in with how the Bulls were built on both ends of the floor.

While the Bulls may want to consider a trade for a center such as Myles Turner if the goal is to make a leap up the standings in the East (the Bulls were mentioned as Rudy Gobert suitors), that will not be easy due to a lack of first-round picks they can send out (their 2023 and 2025 first-rounders were sent to Orlando to acquire Vucevic in the first place).

Which is why Vucevic may be a smart extension at the right price — but what is that price? He is set to make $22 million this season, the final year of a four-year, $100 million contract (signed with the Magic). That salary puts Vucevic in the earnings ballpark of Turner, Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela, and a little above Jusuf Nurkic.

Would a two-year, $36-$38 million extension work for both sides? That would make Vucevic still very tradable for the Bulls (especially if he finds his 3-point shot again) but pay him about the average of centers of similar impact. With the rising salary cap, the Bulls may be open to two years, $40 million.

Whatever the number, don’t be shocked if the sides get a deal done. The added security makes sense for both the team and the player."

He is now the cornerstone of Boston’s championship hopes and, as such, is off the table.

How do players deal with that? Tatum told Justin Quinn of Celtics Wire that as a pro, a player just has to learn to “control what they can control” and tune out the noise.

That’s the world we live in, right? It always comes from an anonymous source. But it always makes ESPN or Twitter or whatever, and everybody sees it. So you never know what is true and what’s not true, but it gets people to talk about it, and I guess that’s the idea. They got what they wanted out of the deal, for people to talk about it and make speculations. If you pay attention to everything you see on Twitter or TV, you drive yourself crazy. I think that’s just something that you have to learn just to keep your own sanity and your own peace. They will literally say anything, and some of it might be true, and there are other things that just couldn’t be further from the truth. But, the average fan at home doesn’t know the difference, and they just might believe whatever they see. And it doesn’t help that people on the sports talk shows are talking about it every day and we don’t know who said it, so just control what you can control. That’s what I always live by.

Veterans tend to be better at the “control what you can control” idea — the first time through the turbulent trade rumor vortex tends to throw young players off. For players this isn’t a simple fantasy basketball trade where they pull a different color jersey over their head, lives are uprooted — finding a new place to live for yourself and your family, new schools for kids, the challenges of figuring out a new city, everything that makes moving a pain in the backside for all of us is dropped on a player in an instant midseason. Agents and teams can help with logistics, and players are well compensated for their lifestyle and these changes, but it’s still disruptive.

Fortunately for Tatum, he has risen to a status above that fray — not to say his name will never come up in another legitimate trade rumor. It inevitably will. But trades of All-NBA, franchise cornerstone players are much rarer, and the player has some leverage in them.

Keeping Donovan Mitchell — and Mike Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Patrick Beverley and other veterans — on the roster will mean wins.
Second, he said the Jazz have little stomach for bringing in Julius Randle as part of the trade.","The latest update on the Donovan Mitchell trade front remains there is no update.

Utah is still looking to trade Mitchell, and the Knicks remain the clear frontrunner because they have the first-round picks the Jazz seek, but the sides are not close and Utah is willing to carry Mitchell into the season rather than settle for less than their asking price. And that asking price is more than the four (really, five) first-round picks they got in the Rudy Gobert trade.

Tony Jones, the Jazz beat writer for The Athletic, joined Michel Scotto on the Hoopshype podcast Friday and gave just that update:

I don’t think the two sides are close. I don’t think they have been close. We’ll see what happens as the urgency of training camp looms. The Jazz want what they want, which is picks out of this deal, and they want young guys on short or rookie contracts. By definition, that means Toppin, Grimes and Quickley… The Knicks don’t want to unload Derrick Rose. He’s long been a favorite of Tom Thibodeau. I know the Knicks want to hang onto him and Grimes. Those guys are priorities… The sense I get right now is it’s probably not going to happen on an imminent level. The two sides aren’t close. To me, I think if it’s going to happen, it’s going to happen closer to training camp or the start of the season. If it doesn’t happen then, we’ll see what happens closer to the February trade deadline.

There should be some pressure on the Jazz around training camp because, for all the picks they got in the Gobert trade, Utah’s most valuable rebuilding asset is its own first-rounder. Put more bluntly: If the Jazz want to be in the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes next June, they need to lose a lot of games. Keeping Donovan Mitchell — and Mike Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Patrick Beverley and other veterans — on the roster will mean wins.

But Danny Ainge is not one to be rushed. He is playing a long game, and if it means waiting until the season starts — where maybe the Knicks stumble in a deep East and get a little desperate — he will wait it out. Maybe a three-team trade with the Lakers will even find a second life (although that is more of a longshot).

Two other interesting notes from Jones on the podcast. First, he said that the Heat do not have the assets the Jazz want and are not close to a deal (while you can argue, as Ira Winderman has, that trading for Tyler Herro and then flipping him can get Utah two more firsts, Jones suggests Utah is not interested in that extra step). Second, he said the Jazz have little stomach for bringing in Julius Randle as part of the trade. So keep him out of your trade machine attempts to get this deal done."

There will be some top-flight NBA talent playing in EuroBasket this September. Giannis Antetokounmpo — and all three of his brothers — will suit up for Greece. Nikola Jokic will play for Serbia. Rudy Gobert will play for France. Domantas Sabonis will lace them up for Lithuania.

Now add Goran Dragic to a Slovenian team that already had Luka Doncic signed up.

Dragic scored 35 points in the championship game to lead Slovenia to the 2017 EuroBasket championship. He is a legend in his home nation and someone who can still contribute to winning basketball. There was some concern about getting the proper insurance for the two NBA players on the team, but that has been worked out.

Slovenia finished fourth in the 2020 Olympics, getting out of group play and beating Germany in the first medal round, but then losing in the semifinals to France. Australia beat Slovenia in the bronze medal game. They enter EuroBasket as a team with a legitimate chance to medal.

In EuroBasket 2022, Slovenia is in Group B with old friends Germany and France, as well as Hungary, Lithuania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is a stacked group, but the top four will advance to the 16-team medal round (finishing higher in the group should make the path through the single-elimination rounds easier).

But Doc coached a young Tracy McGrady in Orlando (starting in McGrady’s fourth season), is he saying Maxey is more impressive than McGrady?
We know at least Maxey has Doc Rivers in his corner.","Two things are true. First, Tyrese Maxey has been a find for the Philadelphia 76ers. Selected No. 21 in the 2020 NBA Draft, he’s one of the latest in a long line of guards who came out of Kentucky and looked much better in an NBA system than John Calipari’s (Devin Booker, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Tyler Herro, Jamal Murray, De'Aaron Fox… and the list goes on).

Second, Doc Rivers loves hyperbole.

Combine the two and you get Doc Rivers going over the top in praising Maxey while on ESPN’s “The VC Show” podcast with Vince Carter (hat tip NBC Sports Philadelphia).

“He’s the most impressive young player I’ve ever had, in 21 years of coaching. His work ethic, Vince, is beyond belief. Many times already this summer, already two or three times, we’ve had to tell him to go sit down somewhere and go relax. “He works with Sam Cassell and my son Spencer, they’re skill-developing coaches. He called Spencer two weeks ago because, I guess like Ros, he went on vacation. The difference, Ros, is this is the first vacation he’d ever been on in his entire life. That’s what he was telling us. I was like, ‘Wait, what?’ He was like, ‘No, I’ve never been on vacation. He asked Spencer, ‘What do you do on vacation?’ True question, what do you do on vacation? And Spence was like, ‘You relax!’ And [Tyrese goes], ‘For how long? For how many days? We’re going for a week, I can’t relax for a week.'”

That’s a fantastic anecdote, and Maxey is poised for a big step forward in his third season. But Doc coached a young Tracy McGrady in Orlando (starting in McGrady’s fourth season), is he saying Maxey is more impressive than McGrady? Again, Rivers loves hyperbole.

How Maxey will settle in if, as expected, James Harden takes over more of the playmaking duties in Philly is something to watch. However, last season after the All-Star break — when Harden was in the mix for the 76ers — Maxey’s scoring went up a little but his efficiency went through the roof — 65.5 true shooting percentage, 48% from 3. If Maxey can find that groove again, the 76ers become that much more dangerous.

Maxey is extension eligible after this coming season and the 76ers will gladly pay him the max if he keeps performing at this level.

We know at least Maxey has Doc Rivers in his corner."

If ever.

However, the Lakers, Knicks, and Jazz discussed a three-team trade that would have sent Donovan Mitchell to the Knicks and Russell Westbrook to the Jazz to be bought out, with a lot of picks going to Utah and other players in the mix, reports Michael Scoto of Hoopshype.

The proposed three-team trade scenario included Westbrook going to Utah and getting bought out. Utah would send Donovan Mitchell to the Knicks, a combination of two players, including Patrick Beverley and Jordan Clarkson, Bojan Bogdanovic or Malik Beasley to the Lakers, and the Jazz would receive significant draft pick compensation from the Knicks and Lakers. The Knicks also would’ve had to part with veteran salary filler(s), such as Derrick Rose to help make the salaries work. The Lakers also have had interest in trading for Knicks forward Cam Reddish, who could also become part of a trade. Last season, the Lakers nearly acquired Reddish as part of a blockbuster three-team trade talks between the Lakers, Knicks and Raptors at the time.

While this trade makes some sense on the surface, there are also a lot of questions and details, and that’s usually where the devil lies and things get bogged down.

Questions that start with: How many picks are going to the Jazz? Scotto notes in that same Hoopshype story Utah wants more picks back in a Mitchell trade than it got in the Rudy Gobert trade, which was essentially five first-rounders (four future picks plus 2022 first-rounder Walker Kessler). Based on their choices in other trade talks, the Lakers likely were only willing to throw in one of their two tradable first-round picks in this deal, so would the Knicks have thrown in four or five more first-rounders headed to Utah? Would the Jazz want at least five first-rounders just for Mitchell plus one or two more for taking on Westbrook, making it six or seven total?

Then there are the other questions: What players were coming back to the Lakers? Derrick Rose, Cam Reddish and maybe a Utah veteran? Would some Jazz veterans be sliding to New York in this trade? There are a lot of possible permutations of this deal, but like all three-team trades finding a balance where every team gets what it wants and can claim the trade as a win is exceedingly tricky.

The biggest takeaway from this entire report should be the Jazz wanting a bigger haul than the Gobert trade for Mitchell — the trade for the French big man warped the trade market. It has impacted what the Nets expect (but are not getting) for Kevin Durant, and it made other GMs around the league say, “I’m not going over the top and risking the derision Minnesota faced for one player/deal.” It’s going to be hard for Danny Ainge to get that haul again.

We don’t know how far down the road these three-team talks got — teams talk about A LOT of things on a surface level that never move past that into serious discussions. But it wouldn’t be shocking if, when things get closer to training camp and Mitchell trade talks start to warm up again, one of the three teams decides to kick the tires on this deal one more time."

Why not bring in a third or maybe fourth team to help facilitate a trade? Because teams don’t want to help out, reports Ian Begley of SNY.TV.

Part of the pessimism stemmed from the idea that, as of last month, there was little appetite in the market for teams to serve as a third or fourth team to facilitate a Durant trade. “No one wants to help (Brooklyn get a deal done),” one team remarked.

I’m skeptical of this — teams may not want to help, but they will once the price is right for them.

Maybe that means two first-round picks to a team with cap space — the Spurs or Pacers, Utah could join them after veterans are traded — to jump in and take on a contract, but those teams aren’t holding out just because they don’t want the Nets or some other team to succeed. This isn’t personal, it’s business. Make it well worth their while and they will help, but they will not do Durant and other teams a favor.

All has been quiet on the Durant front for weeks now. Maybe that will change as we get to the start of training camp — will Durant show up for the Nets camp? What about Kyrie Irving? — but right now there is no pressure and little motivation for teams to improve their offers and re-engage with Brooklyn."

Thursday was the first day the Lakers and LeBron James could talk contract extension beyond this coming season. The Lakers can offer up to $97.1 million over two years to keep LeBron playing his home games at Staples Center through his age 40 season.

The sides talked and LeBron’s agent, Rich Paul, told Dave McMenamin of ESPN that the discussions were “productive.”

LeBron James and his representative Rich Paul of Klutch Sports met with Lakers VP of basketball ops and GM Rob Pelinka on Thursday regarding James’ eligible contract extension. Paul told ESPN the discussion was “productive” and both sides will continue a dialogue. — Dave McMenamin (@mcten) August 4, 2022

No deal was reached, according to McMenamin. LeBron has until June 30 of next year to sign an extension with the Lakers.

The negotiations are not about money, the Lakers will gladly give LeBron the max. The Lakers can offer two years at $97.1 million, one year at $47 million, or LeBron could choose a 1+1 option where he would have a player option after the first season of his extension.

That option would fall in the summer of 2024, the first year his son Bronny James could enter the NBA. LeBron has said he wants to play a season with his son.

LeBron’s family and how comfortable they are in Los Angeles will play a big role in his decision on an extension. In the past, LeBron has used short contracts and potential free agency as leverage to push roster moves he wants to see out of a franchise. The Lakers as currently constructed are not a contender, LeBron’s relationship with Russell Westbrook is “frosty,” and there has been discussion of a Westbrook trade (either for the Nets’ Kyrie Irving or the Pacers’ Buddy Hield and Myles Turner). LeBron may push for roster moves he wants to see before putting pen to paper in Los Angeles. Would the Lakers be more willing to put the two first-round draft picks they control — 2027 and 2029 — into a trade if they knew LeBron was locked in for a few more years? Maybe.

LeBron could choose not to sign the extension and become a free agent next summer at age 38. But is he looking to be on the move again with his family settled in Los Angeles and his post-career entertainment company business based in the city?

Looking or not, speculation will run through the NBA until LeBron puts pen to paper on that extension (or a new contract)."

This ain’t right man… bring BG home.","On Thursday, a Russian judge sentenced WNBA and Team USA star Brittney Griner to nine years in prison for drug possession and smuggling.

In what quickly became a very politically loaded case, Griner was “wrongfully detained” according to American diplomats after police at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport said they found vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage. This amount measured out to less than a gram. Griner had pled guilty, likely looking to reduce her sentence (in a trial where the outcome was predetermined), but still got very near the maximum the judge could impose. Negotiations on a prisoner exchange involving Griner are ongoing.

The basketball world and beyond reacted with shock and support for Griner. What follows is a sampling of that reaction.

“Today’s verdict and sentencing is unjustified and unfortunate, but not unexpected and Brittney Griner remains wrongly detained,” WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a joint statement. “The WNBA and NBA’s commitment to her safe return has not wavered and it is our hope that we are near the end of this process of finally bringing BG home to the United States.”

“Today, American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney,” President Joe Biden said in a statement. “It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates.”

He has never asked for a trade.

Yet Danny Ainge and the Jazz are trying to trade him (in the wake of trading Rudy Gobert, Royce O’Neal, and shopping every other veteran on the roster). Talks may have stalled out with New York, but the smart money is still on him ending up with the Knicks (they have picks, the Jazz want picks, the two sides likely work it out). But if not New York, it is expected the Jazz will trade Mitchell somewhere (Miami?) before the season starts.

For some Jazz fans this is confusing — why not rebuild around Mitchell, why trade him? The Salt Lake Tribue’s Andy Larsen tried to answer that question recently (starting with the fact the status quo was not near good enough, sparking the Gobert trade):

The overwhelming feeling among league insiders is that Mitchell is likely to sign outside of Utah at the first available opportunity in 2025. Mitchell considers New York home. Mitchell has spent the majority of this offseason in New York this year. His skills trainer, Chris Brickley, operates out of a gym in the city. It makes sense that he’d be interested in living there full time. There are other places he’s reportedly interested in — Miami being a candidate as well. There’s a sense that many in Mitchell’s team would prefer he play in a larger market than Utah. Such a market would likely earn him a bigger profile, and perhaps more money, from sponsors. There are sociopolitical issues in Utah, too. Mitchell has been outspoken about incidents of racism of Utah, especially when directed at kids. He spoke out against Utah’s critical race theory resolution, which earned him derision from Utah Senate president Stuart Adams.

Jazz fans had heard those rumblings before but maybe didn’t want to believe them or thought a run to the finals could change that trajectory. However, for people in NBA front offices, it has long been a matter of “when” Mitchell left the Jazz, not “if.” (This has been reported in countless places and for years, NBC Sports included.) Mitchell isn’t the personality type to make this public or force a trade, but there was little doubt around the league he would bolt.

If new owner Ryan Smith wanted to chase rings in Utah, the Gobert/Mitchell era needed to end. The peak of those teams wasn’t quite at the required level and there was no realistic path to a title. If Mitchell was not going to be part of what was next, better to trade him now for picks/players that can be part of that future.

This all follows the Danny Ainge pattern from Boston. How long the rebuild takes in Utah will depend on luck with lottery ping-pong balls and player development programs, but there will be a serious step back before one that goes forward. There are a few rough seasons ahead (maybe ones filled with hope, but rough seasons).

The question now is when Mitchell gets traded, not if. Also, to where. But the trade is coming. It was time."

Enter 13-year NBA veteran Vernon Maxwell, who went on the “No Chill with Gilbert Arenas” podcast and retold the story of a wild halftime fight between himself and Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon. It’s a story Maxwell told before on “The Right Time with Bomani Jones” podcast (hat tip to Matt Young for the reminder).

The Rockets were on the road in Seattle playing the Supersonics and had a terrible first half, as Maxwell tells it. Maxwell was complaining to teammates he wasn’t getting enough touches — he even spat on the floor — and when Olajuwon got word of it, he walked over and slapped Maxwell across the face, in the locker room in full view of their teammates. We’ll pick up Maxwell’s commentary from there:

“I said, ‘Goddamn, this motherf***** slapped the s*** out of me.’ That motherf***** hit me so hard, man, knocked me out the chair. I jumped up, grabbed my chair, and throwed it at [that] motherf*****, bust the glass in the locker room. Everybody running out. Police come in with the guns drawn, like ‘What the hell goin’ on in here?’ “I was like, ‘Damn, they got the guns on me at a professional halftime.’ At a professional game.”

Maxwell also said on the pod he picked up a piece of glass and planned to stab Olajuwon, but the police came in, then the game restarted, and he never did it.

I don’t remember trying to stab anyone but if I did it was out of love. https://t.co/IvGN5LqyQS — Vernon Maxwell (@VernonMaxwell11) January 2, 2022

Maxwell said the vibe and Olajuwon changed after he converted and became a Muslim.

“After that, he became Muslim. He was so quiet. So humble. So, [he] wanted me to become Muslim. I couldn’t do it. But, he was a great teammate after that.”

Maxwell and Olajuwon went on to win two titles together with the Rockets. Olajuwon was an iconic big man who eventually tutored future generations on footwork in the post. The Maxwell halftime story probably didn’t come up in those sessions."

That is why most people NBC Sports has spoken with around the league expect LeBron to sign the extension in some form.","LeBron James has been in the media spotlight since he was a high school junior and on the cover of Sports Illustrated as “The Chosen One.” He’s become comfortable in that glare and a master message sender — he choreographs everything he says, every Instagram post, so that the image and message he wants are projected to the world. Nothing is an accident.

The day before the Lakers could — and later on Thursday will — offer him a two-year, $97.1 million contract extension that would keep him in purple and gold through age 40, what was the message LeBron sent? He worked out with his sons Bronny and Bryce at the Lakers’ practice facility.

The post is another in a long line this summer highlighting how much family means to LeBron, and this shows how entrenched in Los Angles he and his family are now.

Family appears to be the biggest factor in LeBron James’ decision to sign an extension with the Lakers, something he can officially do today (Thursday, Aug. 4).

LeBron has a long history of using short-term contracts to leverage what he wants out of an organization, and these Lakers, as constructed, are not title contenders. The Russell Westbrook trade situation looms over the team, as do questions about whether they will use both of their tradable first-round picks — 2027 and 2029, the last picks they can trade this decade — to make significant roster changes. The Lakers fired their head coach, brought in a new one and revamped the role player roster to get more athleticism and shooting, but that will only take this team so far. Would LeBron signing an extension make the Lakers more likely to use future picks to bolster the current team? Maybe.

That’s all business. Ultimately for LeBron, family is first — and his family is comfortable in Los Angeles.

That is why most people NBC Sports has spoken with around the league expect LeBron to sign the extension in some form. Eventually. He may well milk the leverage to send a message about roster changes — although it’s not like Rob Pelinka and company have not tried to trade Westbrook — but in the end, LeBron does not give off the vibe of a guy looking to bolt Los Angeles.

At least until his son Bronny becomes NBA draft eligible in two years. LeBron has made it clear he wants to play a season with his son. It is the one thing everyone believes he would leave Los Angeles to do. Maybe the Lakers would use their 2024 first-round pick to select Bronny and keep the family working out at their practice facility, except the Lakers don’t control that pick. The Pelicans do from the Anthony Davis trade. As Joe Varden laid out well at The Athletic this week, the Pelicans have the option of using that 2024 pick or deferring to 2025 and letting the Lakers select in 2024. It’s obviously far too early for anyone to make that call. (Also, how good an NBA prospect Bronny is remains in question, a lot of scouts don’t have him in the first round if drafted at all. But if picking Bronny also gets a team the big box office that is LeBron for a season, the calculus changes.)

LeBron has three options with the Lakers’ extension offer (which would add years beyond coming season, where LeBron will make $44.5 million with Los Angeles):

1) Ignore it, don’t sign it, and become a free agent next summer.

2) Sign it for the full two years and lock himself in with the Lakers until age 40.

3) Sign for one additional year, or one year with a player option for the second year (a 1+1).

Option 3 keeps LeBron settled in Los Angeles but with flexibility if and when Bronny enters the NBA in another market. Most sources around the league NBC spoke with expected LeBron will go with option three — a 1+1 — but that he may take his time signing it. There is no rush (the extension can be signed through next June). And if that keeps the pressure on the Lakers to upgrade the roster, all the better.

If LeBron takes his time with the extension, speculation will run rampant on social media. Welcome to the modern NBA. Talk of a LeBron return to Cleveland will grow. But LeBron will keep his eye focused on what matters to him. And that is family."

He didn’t do it more often for fear of completely losing Westbrook. Instead, he lost his job.

Now Darvin Ham takes over the big chair for the Lakers and it looks like he will have Westbrook to deal with, at least at the start of the season. Ham also will have the authority to bench Westbrook at the end of games if that’s best for the team to win, reports Jovan Buha at The Athletic.

Lakers head coach Darvin Ham will have more power to bench Westbrook down the stretch of games, according to league sources. (Former head coach Frank Vogel did so a few times last season). That could eventually extend to removing Westbrook from the starting lineup as well.

Buha wisely states that Westbrook may close some games for the Lakers, depending upon matchups and needs. If the need is shot creation, he should be on the court. If the Lakers need to get a stop… there may be better options.

The real challenge for Ham is keeping Westbrook interested, engaged, and making sacrifices for the team if he doesn’t close — or doesn’t start — games. That was always Vogel’s biggest fear, that things could get worse, and it’s why Ham has talked up Westbrook from his initial press conference. Ham is a more forceful personality, but if Westbrook mentally checks out there is only so much anyone can do (this team already has LeBron James on it as a locker room leader).

The Lakers’ preferred option would be for Ham to have to figure out how to fit Kyrie Irving in the rotation — or maybe Buddy Hield and Myles Turner — but for now it looks as if Russell Westbrook will be in camp. How Ham uses and gets through to Westbrook will go a long way in deciding how good the Lakers are (along with how healthy and engaged Anthony Davis is)."

Ten-year NBA veteran — and Dancing With The Stars winner — Iman Shumpert has been arrested on a felony marijuana charge at the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.

TMZ broke the news.

NBA player Iman Shumpert was arrested for having a “sizeable” amount of marijuana in his backpack at the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport on Saturday … TMZ Sports has learned. According to the police report, officers responded to a potential drug violation call around 2:40 PM … after TSA screeners found a plastic bag filled with a “green leafy substance” in Shumpert’s bag, which he admitted was weed. Cops say the substance weighed 6.12 ounces and tested positive for marijuana using a mobile test.

While we can debate whether six ounces is a “sizeable” amount, this is Texas, not a state where marijuana has been legalized (CBD products can be sold under a 2019 law). In Texas, the amount Shumpert was found with is considered a felony. Police also found 14 9mm bullets in Shumpert’s luggage, however, there was no gun and that is not part of the charges.

Shumpert has largely been out of the NBA since the 2019-20 season. He played 13 games for the Nets in the pandemic/bubble season and two games the season after that (he was not in the NBA last season). A 2016 NBA champion as part of the Cavaliers, Shumpert recently launched a podcast for Uninterrupted with his brother Ahrri, plus as an actor he has a reoccurring role on Showtimes’s “The Chi,” according to Salon."

Things get wrapped up quickly with the NFL (something more true with the NBA in recent years).
The NFL remains the 800-pound gorilla of American sports — its ratings, revenue and clout dominate the sports landscape.","Last year, the NBA investigated the Chicago Bulls and Miami Heat and found “each violated league rules governing the timing of this season’s free agency discussions.” Which is a fancy way of saying the Bulls and Heat were guilty of tampering (with Lonzo Ball and Kyle Lowry, respectively).

The punishment? Each team lost a second-round pick, which would have been in the 50s overall. It was a slap on the wrist by Adam Silver and company, not a deterrent. Which is why you saw the Philadelphia 76ers (around the James Harden contract() and New York Knicks (with Jalen Brunson) make moves this offseason that may prove to be tampering but unquestionably improved their teams. Both teams will take a slap on the wrist to take that step forward on the court.

Compare that to the NFL, which came down hard on Miami and took away a first-round pick, a third-round pick, plus suspended Dolphins owner Stephen Ross for the first six weeks of the 2022 season — all for FAILED tampering. The Dolphins didn’t land former Saints coach Sean Payton or former Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, they just talked to them. That was enough.

It speaks to very different core ideas about how to run a league (something Heat beat writer Ira Winderman and I talked about today). It also speaks to how much power the players have in the NBA vs. the NFL, where players are more of a commodity and teams treat their careers as disposable.

The NBA knows there is widespread tampering. It understands in an age of iPhones and social media, there is only so much they can do to contain it, so the goal is to keep the playing field somewhat level. The NBA is comfortable with the players having so much leverage over their career and where they play (a little too comfortable for some owners, with recent things such as the Kevin Durant trade request).

Rodger Goodell and the top-down NFL want to control everything — which means stomping out tampering with punishments that make teams step back from the line. The Dolphins were made an example of; the punishment was a deterrent.

The NBA likes the drama around the league, the weeks of “where will Rudy Gobert get traded?” or “where will P.J. Tucker sign?” talk that keeps sports fans buzzing. The league hasn’t figured out how to monetize all that buzz yet — be sure they are working on it — but they see the value in fans obsessing over what comes next and what moves their teams should make.

Fans obsess over NFL moves as well, but not an apples-to-apples comparison because both the salary structures for the two leagues are different, and the impact a single player can have is different. Thanks to the franchise tag and other owner-friendly features, NFL free agency can lack drama. Executives are not flying to meetings in the Hamptons to impress anyone to join their team. Things get wrapped up quickly with the NFL (something more true with the NBA in recent years). Part of that drama is also the nature of the games. While there are Brady/Aaron Rodgers exceptions, one player does not change a franchise’s chances every time they step on the field the way an All-Star level NBA player does just because of how much an NBA player touches the ball and can control the flow of a game.

The NFL remains the 800-pound gorilla of American sports — its ratings, revenue and clout dominate the sports landscape. But the NBA may have a better sense of navigating the evolving media and social world that is natural to younger generations — and a wink-wink attitude toward tampering highlights that."

He showed off the skills, and the Magic will put the ball in his hands and ask him to create.

But the last No. 1 overall pick to win Rookie of the Year was Ben Simmons, and only three of the previous 10 ROYs were the top pick (Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins were the other two). There’s a genuine chance that someone else is going to jump up and grab that trophy.

Who? From our partners at Point Bet, here are the odds for the 2023 NBA Rookie of the Year (the top 10 players):

Paolo Banchero (Magic) +350

Chet Holmgren (Thunder) +375

Jaden Ivey (Pistons) +550

Jabari Smith (Rockets) +650

Johnny Davis (Wizards) +2500

Ousmane Dieng (Thunder) +3000

Some thoughts on that list:

• As noted above, Banchero deserves to have the lowest odds. Watching him in Las Vegas, he has the build and skills of a quality NBA player walking in the door to Magic training camp, and things should only improve from there. He is absolutely going to be the guy to beat for this award.

• Chet Holmgren impressed in Las Vegas and could win this award — he had Josh Giddey showed some pick-and-roll chemistry, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander makes everyone look better, and he’s going to have a real defensive impact and some highlight blocks. Not sure if it’s enough to win it all, but he has a chance.

• My bet would be on Keegan Murray — he is just a guy who knows how to play the game. He showed an impressive shot in Las Vegas, was calm under pressure, and it’s easy to imagine him running the break with De'Aaron Fox or pealing off a Domantas Sabonis dribble hand-off and making a play in the halfcourt. He’s going to get real run on a team thinking playoffs, and he could surprise and win this thing.

• I like Jabari Smith, but not to win this award as a rookie. Jalen Green and Kevin Porter Jr. will have the ball in their hands in Houston and that duo are not the playmakers they will become yet, Smith may not get the touches.

• I like Jaden Ivey’s fit next to Cade Cunningham in Detroit, but playing with another guard who should have the ball in his hands more hurts his chances at this award."

That’s no secret, it has been that way for weeks, and there are multiple reasons for it. That starts with the time of year — a lot of executives are on vacation — to the perception the Nets’ asking price for the two-time Finals MVP is too high. Teams look at what the Nets are asking for (starting with an All-Star level player under 25) and don’t think they could put together an offer the Nets would accept while remaining a contender. For example, that’s why the Heat won’t include Bam Adebayo in talks, and why the Pelicans have not put Brandon Ingram in any offer. Teams are not getting in a bidding war and upping tier offers.

Durant had been radio silent, but now comes a rumor that Durant and Nets owner Joe Tsai will sit down and talk face-to-face, via Steve Bulpett at Heavy.com.

“What I’m hearing is that KD is going to meet with the owner this week,” the source told Heavy Sports. “He’s going to go directly to the owner, Joe Tsai, sometime this week. We’ll see how that works.”

One second-hand source makes this more rumor than report, but for fun let’s pretend it’s true. There are only two things Durant could say in this meeting:

1) That he means what he said in his trade request, he wants out and will hot report to Nets training camp. That could push the Nets to take a trade below what they believe is the market value for KD (the Rudy Gobert trade messed up expectations for what the return for Durant would be).

2) Durant rescinds his trade request, at least for now. The Nets hope this is the case, but it’s a long shot. Durant is not someone prone to rash decisions where he changes his mind, although the market for his services may force him to reconsider a little. The Nets with Durant, Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons surrounded by quality role players (Joe Harris, Patty Mills, Nic Claxton and on down the line), would be a contender in the East. Winning can cure a lot of ills.

We’ll see if this meeting happens and what comes of it, if there is a public shift from the Nets. It’s about the only thing that could move the needle on Durant trade talks as we head into August."

His critics question if all that confidence is deserved, but his swagger is part of why nobody can take their eyes off the Timberwolves’ soon-to-be 21-year-old wing. It’s why he was a natural as “Kermit,” the antagonist to Juancho Hernangomez’s Bo Cruz in Netflix’s “Hustle.” It’s why, after a sophomore campaign where he averaged 21.3 points a game and helped lead Minnesota back to the postseason, everyone wants to see what is next for Edwards.

His goals are lofty. As you would expect. Here’s what he told Zion Olojede of Complex:

Me personally, I want to be an All-Star Starter. I want my averages to go up. I want to win a lot of games and go deep into the playoffs.

Cracking the All-Star starting five in the West is its own Everest because Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic and LeBron James are all but locks to get starting spots. Space is limited. But if Andrew Wiggins can do it, why can’t Edwards?

Lasting deeper into the playoffs feels more possible after adding Rudy Gobert to the Timberwolves roster. Last season, Minnesota got bounced in the first round of the postseason by Memphis — Edwards and the Timberwolves would race out to big leads, only to have the Grizzlies grind them down and win the games.

Man, I feel like we handed it to them, man. It was like taking candy from a baby and they took the candy. We had every game won man and I don’t know what happened. I don’t know what happened.

Putting Gobert with Karl-Anthony Towns along the front line, with Edwards entering his third year and ready for a leap, there will be a lot of eyes on the Timberwolves this season.

Commissioner Adam Silver should retire number 6 across the @NBA in honor of Bill Russell’s legacy! — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) August 2, 2022

The NBA Finals MVP trophy is named after Russell — he was on the stage to hand it to Stephen Curry this year — but does that go far enough?

There is the beginnings of a groundswell behind the idea of retiring Russell’s No. 6, with Dan Woike of The Los Angeles Times and Chris Mannix of Sports Illustrated writing about it. Marc Stein wrote about the idea for Substack and talked about it with Tyson Chandler, who wears the No. 6 in a tribute to Russell.

“I understand when people want to retire a number,” Chandler said. “If it is anyone, I would clearly say it should be the champion of all champions. “But I also think it’s beautiful to see players like myself wear the number in his honor and try to tap into what we were inspired by while watching him — or in my case studying.”

Russell is in the Jackie Robinson rarified air of a Hall of Fame player on the court whose impact off of it may have been even more significant. His passing didn’t just have sports stars praising him, there were three United States presidents who felt the need to express their love and admiration of the man.

If anyone in the NBA deserves this honor, it is Russell. It is an interesting idea that sounds like a fitting tribute.

Commissioner Adam Silver and his NBA tend to move patiently on these kinds of changes (and they are not going to do anything while people are still mourning). Silver is a consensus builder, not someone prone to impulsive decisions. But how much of a consensus needs to be built around the idea of retiring Russell’s No. 6? There are a lot of supporters and it’s hard to imagine anyone trying to stand in the way of the move.

It will not be quick, but momentum toward retiring the No. 6 across the league for Russell is gaining momentum.

Nobody in NBA history is more deserving of the honor."

Turner finds himself mentioned in trade rumors — most prominently to the Lakers with teammate Buddy Hield for Russell Westbrook in a deal that is currently dead, but there are other rumors, too — and the big man shrugs them off like a guard trying to attack him in the lane. A fantastic piece is up on ESPN’s Andscape where Turner talks about the impact of a trip to Tanzania in July and how being in Africa helped evolve his perspective — it is well worth reading — but for basketball purposes, he also talks a little about the trade rumors surrounding him.

This is my fifth offseason with trade rumors going on. ‘He’s going to land here; he’s going to do this. He going to do that.’ I am finally numb to it, in a sense… The way I’m perceiving everything now, my outlook is I’m in great shape right now. I’ve worked my way back for my injuries. And just carry myself as a professional as I always have. Whether that’s in [Pacers] training camp or whether that’s a training camp somewhere else, I’m going to go and be myself. And that’s all anybody, that’s all I can expect for myself. It’s definitely a proving season for me. Just proving it to myself, what I’m capable of. Playing a five position, something that’s obviously very important to me. Something that I’m looking forward to doing this year. My mentality is solid. I’m good to go and everything’s tight in my corner.

That is the attitude of an NBA veteran — Turner knows it’s a business, knows he has limited control over the situation and is just going to go out and do what he does well. Shrug off the rumors.

Turner’s chance at control is coming next summer — he will be an unrestricted free agent. He’s the game’s leading shot blocker — 2.8 a game last season — and added 12.9 points and 7.1 rebounds a night. The only thing slowing him down was a stress reaction in his foot that sidelined him from mid-January through the end of the season. Turner will make $18 million this season and may be due a raise if he puts together a strong season — he is the kind of defensive rim protector and shot blocker who can anchor a defense, plus he is a career 34.9% from 3. He is a quality modern big man who can help a lot of teams, given the chance.

That includes the Pacers. He could be an interesting pick-and-pop combo with Tyrese Haliburton, if we get to see it. Whatever happens, Turner isn’t letting the rumors impact him and his season."

A lot of that speculation will focus on the Cleveland Cavaliers. They have a strong young core with Darius Garland, Evan Mobley, Jarrett Allen and others (a stronger core than when he came back from Miami) and the Cavs would have the cap space to sign LeBron outright without giving up any of those players.

The Cavs are not proceeding with the intention of getting LeBron for a third time… I think family weighs too heavily into this, and the easiest move for him is to stay with the Lakers.

The Cavaliers are building something of their own, something organic that can be special, and that fans are getting behind. LeBron changes that culture and dynamic. Yes, he is just a kid from Akron who will always be welcomed in the city — as was evident at the last All-Star Game — but there are doubts around the league the Cavaliers’ front office wants to mess with what they are building for the short-term gains a 38-year-old (by then) LeBron brings.

The smart money is on LeBron and the Lakers agreeing to a 1+1 extension, keeping him with the team through 2024 but giving him the option of leaving that summer to play with his son Bronny, who would be draft eligible that year. If LeBron leaves the Lakers, his son would be the reason.

Not the Cavaliers."

Zion is more frustrated with the reputation he doesn’t put in the work than the cracks about his weight.
And less concern about the weight clause.","We have written about this before at NBC Sports, but as Marc Stein noted in his latest substack newsletter, the early headlines didn’t tell the real story:

The much-discussed weight clause in Zion Williamson‘s five-year, $193 million max contract extension will only cost him money in the unlikely event the Pelicans waive him. If things ever get to that point, a lot of other things would have gone wrong.

The Pelicans made a Joel Embiid-style bet on Williamson and his health with this contract extension. Much like the injury clauses in Embiid’s contract, this one protects the team if things go very poorly.

The weight clause states Zion must keep the sum of his weight and body fat percentage below 295; if not, the guaranteed money in his contract decreases. However, that doesn’t mean his checks get smaller — so long as the checks are coming he receives the full max amount. The clause means that if the Pelicans ever waive him, Zion’s guaranteed money he is still owed would be smaller.

The Pelicans have legitimate reason to be concerned about Zion’s weight, which has gotten above 300 pounds at times, and is especially concerning for a player who just missed an entire season following foot surgery. The clause is more a reminder for Zion to stay focused — and reportedly he has this offseason with a personal trainer and chef getting him in shape and at a good weight for next season. Zion is more frustrated with the reputation he doesn’t put in the work than the cracks about his weight.

The Pelicans, with Zion, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Jonas Valenciunas, Devonte' Graham, Herb Jones, Larry Nance Jr. and other quality role players could make some noise in the West this season. They’ve got the talent, and the combination of coach Willie Green and McCollum have provided a direction and locker room leadership. There should be genuine hope in New Orleans.

And less concern about the weight clause. It’s not going to be an issue."

Ignoring any potential major shake-ups, Boston Celtics still have to fill out the back end of their roster. They had 12 guaranteed contracts on the books heading into Monday.

They are giving veteran forward Noah Vonleh and seemingly eternal project Bruno Caboclo a chance to make the roster.

Vonleh has a real shot to be in Green on opening night. Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN broke the news of the signing.

Free agent F Noah Vonleh has agreed to a one-year deal with the Boston Celtics, source tells ESPN. Vonleh will go to training camp with the hopes of making the roster. — Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) August 2, 2022

This is a true non-guaranteed contract, not an Exhibit 10 (guys headed to the G-League). Vonleh, a 6’10” stretch four/five, played last season in China, and while that is a league not exactly known for impressive defense, Vonleh put up solid numbers, as friend of the site Keith Smith points out.

Noah Vonleh played 22.8 MPG in 28 games in China last year. Playing time rules for non-domestic players likely kept his minutes down. But he still averaged: 14.4 PPG

9.2 RPG

1.8 SPG

1.3 BPG Really important? He shot 38.8% from three on 116 attempts. Still only 26 years old too. — Keith Smith (@KeithSmithNBA) August 2, 2022

Before that, Vonleh played in 40 games total over three NBA seasons, bouncing between Minnesota, Denver, and Brooklyn. If Vonleh shows he can bring the shot he had in China stateside and stretch the floor for Boston, he will land a roster spot.

It’s going to be a longer shot for Caboclo to make the final roster, but the former No. 20 pick of the Raptors has bounced around the league and has not found a home. Bringing Caboclo in is a decent flier for the Celtics, but it is a flier.

However, last year his role shifted, with Green expected to play more as a pick-and-pop backup five and provide more rim protection. That change, combined with a wrist injury he played through, had things going sideways. Green’s 3-point shooting fell from almost 40% to 26.6%, and he’s not great at being a primary rim protector. Green looked out of place and played like it.

Now signed in Golden State, Green knows his role this season and said Monday he will thrive in it. Via Dalton Johnson of NBC Sports Bay Area.

“Just coming in and play hard,” Green said Monday when asked about his role with the Warriors. “Be a dog. Do the dirty work, help [Draymond Green] out with the dirty work and knock down shots and play defense. Just coming here to play hard.”

With Otto Porter and Gary Payton II moving on to bigger paydays, the Warriors have reworked their bench units for the coming season. Green and Donte DiVincenzo will join young players getting bigger roles in Jordan Poole, Jonathan Kuminga, Moses Moody and James Wiseman. More will be asked of that bench as Steve Kerr tries to keep the minutes for his older starters — Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green — down.

Green said it was Kerr who convinced him to come to Golden State. Green said he had other options.

“After talking with him, I just couldn’t tell him no,” Green said…. “With the organization and what they built over, I just felt that I’d love to be part of it.”

It was no secret, Jalen Brunson reportedly decided to sign with the New York Knicks for four years, $104 million well before free agency opened. Now the NBA is investigating the Knicks for tampering — illegally contacting and recruiting Brunson prior to the official signing period opening on June 30 — reports Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports.

The NBA has begun an investigation into the New York Knicks for alleged tampering regarding free agent pickup Jalen Brunson, sources inform @YahooSports. — Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) August 1, 2022

The NBA is also investigating the 76ers regarding James Harden opting out of his contract to sign for $14 million less next season, money GM Daryl Morey used to round out the Philly roster with players such as P.J. Tucker.

The Knicks and Brunson is a high-profile case with plenty of nuances to debate, although the core of the issue is this: Where does the NBA draw the line on tampering? There were 38 new contract signs and seven contract extensions agreed to on the first day of NBA free agency — approaching half of those in the first 90 minutes after the free agent window opened. Is the NBA suggesting none of those other teams contacted these free agents until free agency officially opened at 6 p.m. Eastern on June 30? Tampering is rampant in the NBA, although done through back channels to give teams plausible deniability. As said before in this space, the NBA needs to seriously crack down on tampering or stop pretending it will.

With Brunson in particular, the Mavericks are reportedly frustrated. However, Dallas shares in the responsibility for losing Brunson. It chose not to offer a fair contract extension to the guard early — wanting to keep his trade value in place rather than lock him down — and by the time it put that offer on the table, it was clear the most they could offer was below Brunson’s market value. The Mavericks made their own bed.

However, there is plenty of circumstantial evidence the Knicks tampered with Brunson, starting with the reports the sides had agreed to terms before free agency officially opened. Beyond that, the Knicks hired Brunson’s father, Rick Brunson, as an assistant coach (although he has been on Tom Thibodeau’s staff before). Then there’s the fact Knicks’ president Leon Rose is a longtime family friend of the Brunsons — Rick Brunson was former agent Rose’s first client — and right now Rose’s son, Sam Rose, is the younger Brunson’s agent. That’s not even getting into Knicks executives William “World Wide Wes” Wesley and Allan Houston, as well as forward Julius Randle, sitting courtside for a Mavericks-Jazz playoff game in Dallas (they may have been showing their interest in Utah’s Donovan Mitchell as well, as those two teams talk about a trade).

The Knicks front office might have had to answer questions about potential tampering if they had invited the media to Brunson’s introductory press conference, but they did not, keeping it a neutered, sterilized event where nobody would have to face anything unflattering.

A year ago, the league found the Bulls and Bucks had tampered in free agent deals and it cost them a late second-round pick (a spot in the draft where historically that player never plays in the league). Teams saw that as a slap on the wrist, not a serious penalty. Is the NBA going to be more serious with tampering fines around the 76ers and Knicks (assuming they can prove tampering), or is it more of the same?

Either way, the Knicks are officially under investigation."

Part of the perfect storm of problems that battered the Lakers last season was that Kendrick Nunn — who they used their mid-level exception to bring in — missed every game due to a bone bruise in his right knee

Nunn picked up his $5.25 million option and will return to the Lakers next season, but he told Chris McGee of Spectrum SportsNet (the Lakers’ cable channel in Los Angeles) that he is 100% healthy and ready to go.

“I feel 100% to be honest. Back to where I’m normally playing at a high level.”

The Lakers could absolutely use Nunn, a talented scorer who plays solid defense at both guard spots, as part of their rotation. Nunn will likely split time at the two guard spot/wing with this year’s mid-level signing, Lonnie Walker IV, although with the Russell Westbrook trade situation still hanging over the team, any predictions on the Lakers’ backcourt rotation are premature. Nothing is settled.

Credit Rob Pelinka, he learned from his past mistakes and built a better supporting cast to go around LeBron James and Anthony Davis this season. With Walker, Nunn, Damian Jones, Thomas Bryant, Juan Toscano-Anderson, and likely more Talen Horton-Tucker and Austin Reaves, the Lakers are more versatile, athletic, and will defend better than they did a season ago.

All that helps, but how good the Lakers ultimately are will depend on LeBron’s health (he’ll be his legendary self when on the court) and how close Anthony Davis can return to the bubble version of himself that the Lakers need."

#1 most bet on for NBA MVP at @CaesarsSports: Zion Williamson at 55/1.
— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) July 29, 2022Two bets I would not make: Kevin Durant and LeBron James.","Nikola Jokic is the two-time defending NBA MVP, but history would suggest don’t bet on him for a three-peat. The last player to win three MVPs in a row? Larry Bird, from 1984-86. Almost 40 years ago.

But if not Jokic, then who? Which players are the favorite to grab the MVP trophy? The list starts with Luka Doncic. From our partners at Points Bet, here are the dozen players with the lowest odds to win NBA MVP next season (the odds are how much you would win on a $100 bet).

Luka Doncic +450

Giannis Antetokounmpo +600

Joel Embiid +600

Nikola Jokic +1000

Kevin Durant +1000

Stephen Curry +1000

Jayson Tatum +1200

Ja Morant +1400

Devin Booker +2200

Kawhi Leonard +2500

Trae Young +2500

LeBron James +2500

It’s not surprising that Doncic is the odds-on favorite. He’s an elite player whose team just lost their No. 2 shot creator — his load just got heavier and his counting stats likely will up. If he comes into the season in shape and ready to play, he has a legitimate shot.

If not Doncic, my money would be on Joel Embiid, who has finished second to Jokic each of the past two seasons and should be in the mix again. Even if James Harden is healthy and taking on some of the scoring load, and Tyrese Maxey takes a step forward, Embiid will put up efficient offensive numbers and be a defensive anchor. He will again be in the mix.

There’s another NBA MVP bet people seem to be leaning into: Zion Williamson, who is +6600 at Points Bet.

#1 most bet on for NBA MVP at @CaesarsSports: Zion Williamson at 55/1. — Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) July 29, 2022

Two bets I would not make: Kevin Durant and LeBron James. It’s not that they are not good enough to win the award or will not have the stats to be in consideration, but both are getting up in age (Durant is 34, LeBron 37) and have an injury history — are they going to play enough games? One of Jokic’s strengths in winning this award the past couple of years is he is on the court — he missed a total of eight games over the last two seasons. LeBron and Durant will likely miss double-digit games (same with Kawhi Leonard) as their teams look ahead to the postseason rather than be focused on winning a random Tuesday game in December."
